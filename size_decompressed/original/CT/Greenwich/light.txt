It was a living thing.;1975-10-15 00:00:00;not sure;it was a living thing all i can tell you from my close sighting is it was a light.  i know what i saw  it came close.  its a living thing and not nuts and bolts it wanted me.  i was so afraid i called out to god. then whatever it was going to do stopped and it went away. it made no sound. it wanted to take me. i will not explain how i knew this or you may call this report a fake. but i will tell you they are evil. after that later on i read the bible and Enoch. Enoch explains them. this happened on the same night there was braking news with Walter Cronkite about people giving there homes and children away to go on a trip to eternity in a UFO.  not sure of the date so i put October 15 1975. which is maybe the wrong date. i am still trying to find the date of that braking news that night. i made a report to mufon and to new york ufo its been haunting me for years and i wish i could forget it.

Star like objects during clear day light in formation.;2010-10-10 12:00:00;4 mins; Star  like objects during clear day light in formation. Around noon while at work. Myself and a co-worker observed small  Star  looking objects in the clear sky.   At first glance it seemed to look like the formation of stars when viewing at night, but these stars seemed to be only in one section of the sky and nowhere else.  One of the formations looked almost like the small dipper.  Then we noticed some of the  star like objects getting closer to one another. They were all the same size and moving east towards long island, NY.;41.0500736263736;-73.6345967032968
Watched 3 bright orange lights flying then suddenly disappearing.;2012-07-01 22:10:00;5 minutes;Watched 3 bright orange lights flying then suddenly disappearing. Watched 3 bright orange lights flying in a triangle (center light in front, two just behind) from NE along the southern CT coastline.   Were flying slower than plane speed and produced no plane noise.   After flying for several minutes, the lights suddenly disappeared.;41.0500736263736;-73.6345967032968
Object comes close to airplane then slowly backs away opposite direction, then stays still.;2018-07-31 22:30:00;+ 1 hour;Object comes close to airplane then slowly backs away opposite direction, then stays still At first, we thought wow 2 planes are getting very close to each other (literally facing each other) until we realized one was an actual airplane and the other object then started to back away from the airplane, as the airplane kept going its original way the other light stayed in position after moving. As if they knew we were watching it stayed there still for quite a long time.  Then we saw another bigger light falling (almost like an asteroid) we followed it since we were driving and there were no sight of landing (it seemed to have landed in the middle of the park) When we arrived home we looked up at the sky for a little and realized many tiny stars moving different directions and flashing...that's when i freaked out and went inside...   could it have anything to do with the moon?  it was huge last night!;41.0500736263736;-73.6345967032968
Two star light objects traveling in tandem with nearly full moon;2020-09-06 00:00:00;5 hours;Two star light objects traveling in tandem with nearly full moon September 6, 2020 3:45 A.M. EDT  For the last four hours this morning, when ever I go outside I have observed on the west side of the nearly Full moon something that I originally thought might be twin stars, but in that period they have stayed in the Relative same position to the moon as it moves from east to west in our night sky.  I cannot determine its Size, but it must be quite far up, and thus it would be a very large object like a large stationary craft of some sort. I have never observed anything like that in the night sky before.  It is a relatively clear night here, so anyone Can see it.  It looks like it might be two bright lights with structures connecting the two bright areas. The moon would not normally stay in the same position relative to twin stars. It is sort of confusing.;41.0500736263736;-73.6345967032968
