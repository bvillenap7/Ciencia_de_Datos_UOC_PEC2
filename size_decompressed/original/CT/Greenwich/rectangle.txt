It was a summer afternoon and my father and myself were washing our car's in the driveway.  The cloud cover was very sporadic or mostly clear blue skies.  I stopped washing the car to go get us something to drink in the house.  While walking up the path to the front door a silver glint caught the corner of my right eye, turning my head and looking up and to the right I saw what I had previously thought impossible.  In the distance at if I lifted my right arm from waist to object would be two o'clock I saw an absolutely enormous silver cube or box!   It looked to be a perfect rectangle and the sun reflected off it giving it a stainless steel appearance.  There seemed to be orange and red circular lights aglow on its surface and it rotated slowly clockwise and drifted further away and at great height until foliage completely blocked my view.   My father also saw it and was as stunned as I was to see a flying box that formed a perfect rectangle with no sign's of propuls! ion but what created even more awe was the sheer size of this object!  As far as it drifted away its size was still amazing! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));41.0500736263736;-73.6345967032968
