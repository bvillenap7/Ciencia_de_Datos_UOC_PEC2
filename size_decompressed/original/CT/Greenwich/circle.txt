i made me feel it was a living thing.  that it was alive;1975-10-17 19:00:00;10 minuts;i made me feel it was a living thing.  that it was alive The best way I can give the exact date of my sighting is there was a news story on tv by walter Cronkite in 1976 or 75. The news story was about ufo and trips to eternity in a ufo where families even gave away there own kids to go on a trip to eternity. A lot of bs agreed.  Anyway heres what happened. Thinking about that news story later that night  I was wondering if they can read minds  So I kept thinking where I am with land marks and directions in my head thinking About new york by looking at a world map.  Right down to where my town is And what my house looks like and what’s near it. So later I sead and watched kojack on tv. As I lay on my bed watching tv what I first think was the moon came in view and maybe It was there all the time and I didn’t know it. Then it moved. Exact direction north east. The edges of it seem to have points and when it moved it looked like it was crawling on the sky. It was round. With small points all around its edge that get longer then Shorter like its pulling itself across the sky. What ever it was I think it was a living thing Of some kind. I was afraid to go near a window night for some time. Or go out at Night. I reported this to other ufo sites just check my story about the trips to eternity and Walter Cronkite. I don’t know how to spell his name so this is a sound like. And I was so afraid  because I could feel it knows me. And can see me. I hope I never see it again. But it leaves me with the memory and I still would like it Explained to me what I saw NOTE i no longer live in greenwich ct and cant give my current address;41.0500736263736;-73.6345967032968

4 orange orbs over Long Island.;2016-07-10 22:34:00;8;4 orange orbs over Long Island 10:34 P.M. 7/10/16  I smelled airplane fuel.  Living near Westchester airport for 30 years and a business flyer.  I know the odor of fuel.  This has never happened.   Thinking a plane had crashed I hit mute and turned off lights.  Looking east over Long Island I saw 4 orange pulsating orbs shaped in a Y formation.  They never moved.   Then a large craft came over our house west to east (never happens) low, slow and pretty silent with a white light forward.  No other lights.  It passes and the 4 orange orbs disappear.

I saw a bright object hovering outside my window that moved in a fashion unlike anything else I've seen;2019-01-06 23:40:00;2 minutes;I saw a bright object hovering outside my window that moved in a fashion unlike anything else I've seen I was lying in bed trying to go to sleep, when I looked out into the horizon and notices two white lights hovering lower than planes would be.  The two lights were coming from a single saucer-like object.  The object did not move in a linear fashion at first it was almost moving in small circles.  After about 30 seconds it moved quickly to my left and disappeared into the sky.  My neighbors have a small farm, which is rare for Greenwich, and the object seemed be hovering around their property.;41.0500736263736;-73.6345967032968
