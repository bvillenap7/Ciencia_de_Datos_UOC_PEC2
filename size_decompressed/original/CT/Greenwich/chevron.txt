At about 10 past midnight on August 23rd, I went outside to admire the stars which were unusually abundant.  A few minutes in, I saw a chevron formation of lights streak across the sky directly overhead.  The lights were orange in color and were not round but rather looked like stunted bowling pins.  There were about 4 or five on each side for a total of 9 to 11.  They appeared to be low enough above the tree tops that at first I thought, cool bats flying in formation! after which I quickly thought, no, bats don't fly in formation, maybe they're ducks.   Then of course almost instantly I realized that neither bats nor ducks glow orange and that it must have in fact been a vessel of some sort which blocked out the stars behind it.  Then, while it was still in a visible spot, unimpeded by treetops, the lights went out and that was it.  I did not notice if the stars continued to be blotted out in the same trajectory, as it all happened so fast.  What was mos! t noticeable was the speed at which it moved across the sky-- 2-3 seconds heading from north to south and the fact that there was absolutely no sound associated with the movement.  Could that have been a stealth bomber? And would it fly  at such a low altitude?;41.0500736263736;-73.6345967032968
