Christmas Eve lights over Greenwich, CT;2001-12-25 00:45:00;3-5 Minutes;Christmas Eve lights over Greenwich, CT From bedroom window, I observed a strange object moving too fast to be a jet or plane at such a high altitute en route to Westchester County Airport (HPN) or La Guardia (LGA).  The object, exhibiting a few different bright colors, seemed to stop, hover, then move up and down before disappearing completely.  The unacceptable movements of the craft are what keep me so skeptical.  A westchester county newspaper the following business day reported that a stealth bomber was on routine post 9/11 patrol lit up for Christmas.  I, however, cannot believe this report as again, the craft was moving in such ways that cannot be explained by our modern day aircraft.  I can accept that perhaps it was a harrier jet, but I do not know which alitute hovering limitations the jet has. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.
