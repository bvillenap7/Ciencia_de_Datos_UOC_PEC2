Glowing Red-Orange Sphere sighted in Greenwich, Ct.;2014-07-14 20:15:00;5 minutes;Glowing Red-Orange Sphere sighted in Greenwich, Ct. My friend & I were walking our 3 dogs in a baseball field next to the Western Junior High School in Greenwich, Ct. I often like to look at star formations and on this particular night when I looked upwards I saw a glowing, bright red-orange sphere.  My friend noticed it too.  My friend thought it looked more orange-red (minor matter). The sphere was approximately 90' in the air from the top of the hill where we were waking and about 100' away.  The sphere moved very slowly across the sky in a straight line.  It proceeded to move behind a large tree that was on the hill and I was curious to keep the thing in my view for as long as possible. When I ran to the other side of the tree the object vanished into thin air.  Poof!  Gone!  To have seen it so clearly from where we were standing I estimated it to be about 2.5' to 3' around.  It made no sound.  It was not a light projection - it was a solid glowing object. We had 3 dogs with us and they made no indication of having seen or felt anything untoward.  There were no other people around - no children, no adults it was a totally clear and quiet evening. I was NEVER a believer in all the UFO stories I heard people talking about, however, I still remain a little unsettled about this sighting.;41.0500736263736;-73.6345967032968
