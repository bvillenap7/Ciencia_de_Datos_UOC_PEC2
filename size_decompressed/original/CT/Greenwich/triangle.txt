Slow moving, quiet very large triangular shaped craft just above the tree line.;1997-05-11 23:00:00;2 minutes;Slow moving, quiet very large triangular shaped craft just above the tree line. Just over the tree line a very large, yet very quiet (faint sound) triangular shaped object with red and green lights passed overhead.  I was leaving the Burning Tree Country Club.  To this day, I can't believe what I saw.  I felt like I could throw a rock up and hit it.  My girlfriend at the time saw it too.  No idea what it could possibly be.  I really believe it was not from this world.;41.0500736263736;-73.6345967032968
