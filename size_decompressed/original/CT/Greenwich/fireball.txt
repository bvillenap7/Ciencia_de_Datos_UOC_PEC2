Greenwich, CT 07/31/2014 - blue/white luminous object streaked across the sky.;2014-07-31 05:25:00;4 seconds;Greenwich, CT 07/31/2014 - blue/white luminous object streaked across the sky. Traveling southbound on Merritt Parkway at approx 5:25 am, between exit 28 (Round Hill Road) and exit 27 (120A). An electric blue/white luminous object streaked across the sky going southwest. I first thought it was a meteorite or a firework because of the tail, but then the object stuttered, stopped, and suddenly zipped southeast at a right angle and then poof!  Gone!   It was not a plane, not a helicopter, no sound.;41.0500736263736;-73.6345967032968
