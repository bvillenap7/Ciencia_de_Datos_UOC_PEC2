Cylindrical object in South Wester Connecticut;2009-04-16 17:25:00;1minute;Cylindrical object in South Wester Connecticut It was around 5:25 PM in Greenwich, CT when I just got on the highway heading North bound.  Clear skies and very light out.  I’m skeptical of other peoples reports as well as when I saw today.  At first I thought it was a blimp, because it appeared white and very slow moving, but I’ve seen many blimps and this was much to thin and much longer than a blimp.  If I had to make a guess, I’d say it was nearly 10,000 feet high from the ground.  It was long and cylindrical in shape.  My next guess is that it was a low flying plane at an angle where I couldn’t make out the wings, and I’m still open to that possibility.  However, if it were an airliner flying that low, then it would have been moving much faster, compared to this object to be moving at the rate of a blimp.  I was driving on the highway during rush hour so I couldn’t stop and get a better look.  But it was clear as day.  Another reason it didn’t seem like an airliner was that I couldn’t make out any wings or a tail wing.    Even as the road twisted giving me a different angle of view, still no wings.  I had sight of it for over a minute at least.  Then the thing seemed to change direction pointing away from me.  I still had clear sight of it, while trying to avoid and accident, it seemed to move a little further in the distance then just vanished.  There were no clouds in the sky and visibility was great, so I don’t know how this thing vanished like it did.  I’m 31, and I’ve seen plenty of blimps, airliners, jets, etc...  Whatever this was, well I just couldn’t explain it or make sense of it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
