On July 21, 2012 in Old Saybrook, Connecticut, at approximately 8:30 PM we saw 4 round shaped objects in the sky.  They were flying in the same pattern about 2 minutes apart.  The objects were fire red/orange with a bright white hue that appeared as they each move across the sky and then quickly ascended upward as a bright white light and then disappeared out of sight.  It was in a definite formation and there was a slight dense humming sound as they passed fairly low overhead.  This was witnessed by 4 adults as we sat on 2nd floor porch of home.   The sighting was very clear and we have a video taken by cell phone and one still picture that we enlarged.;41.2905;-72.39
