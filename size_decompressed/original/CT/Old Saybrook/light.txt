UFO Sighting Monday Evening!;2002-06-17 20:45:00;20 seconds;UFO Sighting Monday Evening! My daughter was outside at 8:45pm with our camcorder.  Three girls saw this white ball of light come up and over the trees.  It moved so fast we had to look twice.  When we viewed the tape it looked like a UFO...  I have never seen anything like this.  We do live near a neuclear power plant also...  Do you know of any sightings on that evening in Old Saybrook, CT?  This was really wild.....  unlike anything I have seen before.  I am saving the tape of this sighting.  It is a film camcorder, not digital.;41.2905;-72.39
Group of 6 to 8 luminous objects slowly moving form NE to SW in the direction of New York City.;2003-11-08 20:00:00;30 min;Group of 6 to 8 luminous objects slowly moving form NE to SW in the direction of New York City. Out looking at the eclipes about 7:45 on the beach (Long Island Sound) in Old Saybrook, Ct.  As I looked to the West, in the the direction of New York City, I saw several orange to white lights just about the horizon. With my binoculars they seemed rather luminous.  My first though was helicopters serching for something between New Haven, and Long Island.  But after hearing the report on the Rense Show I felt that I must of been seeing something rather different.  Being that the lights were so far away I could not make out very much except they would loose and gain altitude, and seemed to have a light (similar to a search light)aiming downward.  Over 30 min period the whole show seemed to move in a NE to SW direction. At times the lights were bright orange, and at other times soft white.  The orange lights would of been very intense of one was close to that area. Thats about it, sorry I was not closer. Ha.;41.2905;-72.39
Flickering light hovering over the Long Island Sound;2009-06-01 20:40:00;40-60 seconds;Flickering light hovering over the Long Island Sound I was sitting in my living room in our house on the shore of the Long Island Sound. I was watching TV and occasionally glancing out the windows looking southwest over the Sound. It was around dusk, so I was starting to see some of the lights over on Long Island, but it was still too early to see stars. Noticing something out of the corner of my eye, I glanced up and saw a dim, flickering light, hovering about 20 degrees above the horizon southwest from my house. It appeared over the Saybrook breakwater, in the direction of Plum Island, but seemed so dim and distant that it looked much farther- maybe even over Montauk or the Atlantic.  I was confused, because it hadn't been there when I last looked, less than a minute ago, so it couldn't be a star.  But it didn't appear to be moving, so it couldn't be a plane.  As I watched it, I thought it might be a plane heading towards me. It appeared to move slightly up and to my left (further north from my perspective) and then faded away.  I didn't see it again. From what I remember, the light flickered like a star and was slightly pink.;41.2905;-72.39
