Fast moving green light, 2 witnesses, a third witness in another state with a similar story.;2004-02-15 23:00:00;1 second;Fast moving green light, 2 witnesses, a third witness in another state with a similar story. Large green star like object appeared while we were driving.  It soared across our view very fast and then disappeared. There was no trail like those you would see after a meteor. Afterwards I got out of the car and heard a jet fly over head.  We were in the car video taping my friend and telling jokes because he just broke his shoulder in a snowboarding accident. The camera was angled down too far to see the object unfortunately however he did catch our reactions on tape which is pretty funny.  I received a voicemail from a friend the next morning that she had left for me the night before. She was traveling around Virginia and leaving me a long message, in the middle of her message she stopped suddenly and said Oh my God something just flew through the sky really fast.  I think I just saw my first UFO! But maybe it was a shooting star, I can't really be sure...  Then in the midst of another message she had left minutes later she stopped again and said What the hell this is freaky I just saw something fly across the sky again really really fast!  When we spoke the next day she had no idea that I had a sighting the same night in a totally different state. I questioned her objectively without leading her to answer any question any specific way. She said the object had no trail, when she first saw it, it flew downwards, then the next time was horizontal.  She said it was a yellowish light.
