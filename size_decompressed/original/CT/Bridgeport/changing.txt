Two lights flying, separating and vanishing in midair.;2014-12-29 17:45:00;5 seconds;Two lights flying, separating and vanishing in midair. Two clear/white circular lights parallel and on a downward angle.  Appeared to resemble a plane flying down, nearing landing into an airport.  The two lights then separated into opposite directions at the same time and vanished.   Was seen from inside a car.  This could not have been a reflection because it was not opaque and at the angle it was at in the sky in regards to reflections from the car windows, it could not have been that, unless it was coming from the floor of the car (Which obviously we would have all seen because it was bright.)   There were 4 people in the car including myself, but one was asleep, the other couldn't see out my window in time, and the driver obviously kept eyes on the road.  Very Strange.

Round circle shape object, not moving then changed shape and disappeared.;2018-09-16 15:45:00;5 minutes;Round circle shape object, not moving then changed shape and disappeared. I was sitting in a lawn chair looking up at the sky and saw what looked like a round silver balloon.  I stared at it for a like 2 minutes and it wasnâ€™t moving suddenly it turned into a huge plate with around 5 sides.  I went to went to grab my phone to take a picture and it disappeared.  I looked around the sky for around 5 minutes but never saw it again.;41.1906331460674;-73.1930814606741
