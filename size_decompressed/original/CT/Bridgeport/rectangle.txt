2 Rectangular/cylindrical lights jump from a white streak and move low over a highway;2008-10-19 01:00:00;25 seconds;2 Rectangular/cylindrical lights jump from a white streak and move low over a highway At about 1am last night (early morning of Sunday, 10/19/08), 5 friends and myself were driving home, there were no other cars on the road and it was very dark (only about 1/2 moon out) when I saw what I initially thought was a shooting star on my left (South-East). The streak was bright white and went from high in the sky to low behind the trees (which were about 50 yards away and 30 feet high).  I noted the streak was thicker than what I thought a shooting star to be and then thought that it was a meteor breaking through the atmosphere.  The streak of light disappeared behind the trees and a moment later a large rectangularly shaped patch of light appeared above us on our right (North-west). The vehicle we were traveling in was moving about 65-75 mph and the rectangular light was obscured by the roof of my car as I got close to it and it was directly on our right.  It is then that 4 of my passengers witnessed a second large rectangular light appear next to the first and together they traveled over the highway behind us and disappeared behind more trees.  The lights were very bright white, so much so that they were almost bluish, and my back right passenger said he saw the two rectangular patches as having bulges in their centers, leading us to believe they were cylindrical in shape, like two cans of soup.  The objects were pretty low in the sky and as far as we could tell close to us. There were six in the car.  The driver was the only one to see the 'shooting star' ahead of us on the left, and all but 1 of us saw the rectangles.  The driver did not see the duo of rectangles or their movements behind the car.  All six are seniors at Fairfield University and in good academic standing and have never seen anything like this before. NOTE: About four miles north east of where we saw these lights is Sikorsky airfield, where they build and test airplanes and helicopters, so this may have been something from there, however the movements, shape and color lead us to believe otherwise.

Cellphone footage reveils objects are actually moving around a short distance and flashing multicolors;2013-11-03 22:07:00;90 minutes;Cellphone footage reveils objects are actually moving around a short distance and flashing multicolors I live at the Fairfield/Bridgeport line, my backdoor faces East toward Milford CT.   At 10:07 pm I looked up at the clear sky full of white stars and noticed a flashing light that were not moving across the sky as any other aircraft I have ever seen.  This object was stationary,simular to the stars.   After viewing with my binoculars my girlfriend passed her cellphone to me so I could begin recording,during this transaction I noticed another flashing odd color object on the rightside which faces long Island New York.  this object had more of a triangular shape as the other began to have a rectangular shape, but within an hour that object seemed to take on a more diamond form, both flashing green, blue and red lights.  In this duration,many airplanes passed in every directions but these objects remained in position.  after viewing for 90 min, I went inside but both objects remained in the sky well after midnight as I glanced out my windows frequently.....have cellphone footage;41.1906331460674;-73.1930814606741
