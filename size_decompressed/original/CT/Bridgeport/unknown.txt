A very bright light was observed, dimmed, moved and then disappeared.;2009-06-19 22:30:00;1 minute;A very bright light was observed, dimmed, moved and then disappeared. Two witnesses saw a bright light in the sky in the approximate direction of NNE. The object appeared about 75 degrees above the horizon. It was too far away to be seen as more than a light, similar to a star or aircraft. However, the object appeared at first too bright to be a star or even an aircraft. The object then began to get dimmer, but from left to right, like it was turning.  It started moving in an easterly direction, and slightly upward. It then got dimmer and started moving faster. It then dimmed so much it seemed to disappear to one witness. The other witness could still see it and it continued to move and then slowly disappear, like it “winked out” of existence, but gradually. Both witnesses continued to watch the sky but did not see it return. Within 20 seconds, two airplanes were observed flying loosely in the same direction as the observed object but from different directions.;41.1906331460674;-73.1930814606741
Object spun in place reversing direction twice and disappeared in a cloud.;2017-07-04 23:30:00;20 minutes;Object spun in place reversing direction twice and disappeared in a cloud. I noticed a solid white light, with a flashing red light, traveling up Long Island Sound.  It then spun in place, traveled back towards NYC.  It once again stopped - spun around in place and came back.   It went into a small cloud and never reappeared.;41.1906331460674;-73.1930814606741
