Witnessed single object flying over at high speed;1999-06-20 04:30:00;approx 10 seconds;Witnessed single object flying over at high speed Object was a single bluish light (no strobe lights normally associated with conventional aircraft). Apparent brightness was slightly brighter than a star, maybe equivalent to a dim planet. Object left no visible trail behind it and moved at a speed seemingly too high for an airplane. Object spotted at medium altitude over the horizon, seen to fly at very high speed in an east-northeast direction apparently at a constant altitude. After approximately 10 seconds, object accelerated out of sight, again leaving no trail behind.;41.1906331460674;-73.1930814606741
RE: Sighting in Newtown, CT JUN 11;2007-06-11 21:00:00;20min.;RE: Sighting in Newtown, CT JUN 11.  We had spotted the same object walking our dogs, my neighbor & myself.  The coordinates are the same.  The red and blue/green lights seemed to hover. Definite movement against the stars and below the moon.  I had spotted it first because of it brightness and clarity of shape at night.  Unfortunately.... there was a report on CNN that the International Space Station could be seen with the naked eye that week at certain times in N. America.  After checking the NASA website for time and location, I was shocked to see the object for the rest of the week in the same approximate location with the exception of one very cloudy night.  Same lights behaving the same manner.  It was at first weird, but very cool nonetheless.;41.1906331460674;-73.1930814606741
Looked like a big round lit Christmas ball;2010-09-16 01:00:00;5 MINUTES;Looked like a big round lit Christmas ball I saw what appeared to be a big red ball (almost like a Christmas light) and there was a stream of light going down to the ground. I opened my window and there were no engines or motor sounds. As I was watching it, the lights dimmed and began moving away and the lights completly went out. I kept watching and finally went back to bed, only to look awhile later and it came back. I dont know how much longer it stayed there, I ended up falling asleep. It just sat in one position with this light going towards the ground. Really weird. It looked like it might have been over Trumbull CT, the town next to mine.;41.1906331460674;-73.1930814606741
Saw a light in the sky fading in and out over Bridgeport, CT.;2010-10-10 17:10:00;Five to Ten minutes;Saw a light in the sky fading in and out over Bridgeport, CT. My girlfriend and I were on our way to the movie theater, when I spotted a light in the sky.  The sky was still relatively bright, as the sun had just barely started going down, so I remember thinking it was unusual to see a star in the sky.  It wasnâ€™t until the light started fading in and out did I point it out to my girlfriend.  It took her a couple of minutes to spot it, but when she did she confirmed that it could not be a star or a plane.  It would fade in and out without any discernable rhythm.  We stared at it for at least ten minutes before getting off the highway, and losing it behind the trees. This is not the first time I'd seen such an object.;41.1906331460674;-73.1930814606741
Small bright light traveling Northwest over clear blue sky.;2011-07-10 17:00:00;5 seconds;Small bright light traveling Northwest over clear blue sky. Small bright light about the size of a grain of rice moving fast across clear blue sky from the Long Island Sound over the beach at Seaside Park traveling NorthWest. Seems to have been at an elevation higher than a cruising airplane (>40,000 feet?).  It had no contrail, made no sound and moved too quickly across sky for it to be a plane or jet.

As my partner and I exited our vehicles we both noticed off in the distance above the horizon approximately 10+ yellow/orange non flash;2016-11-08 17:56:00;4 minutes;As my partner and I exited our vehicles we both noticed off in the distance above the horizon approximately 10+ yellow/orange non flashing/flickering balls of light traveling west to east above 500FT and what appeared to be at least one mile away.  These balls of light appeared to be absent of sound and traveled in groups.  Travel direction and altitude remained constant until they reached a particular eastward point.  Each ball of light (individually) accelerated instantly to incredible speeds and disappeared in the distance once at that point.  Several photos and one small video were obtained during this sighting.;41.1906331460674;-73.1930814606741
Red and green flashing, motionless object that then descended at high speed.  ((anonymous report));2017-09-27 20:18:00;1 minute;Red and green flashing, motionless object that then descended at high speed. Female when outside to smoke cigarette.  Noticed a red and green flashing light in the air. High, suitable plane height. It flashed slowly from red to green, and back again for several moments. Female called her boyfriend outside to look.  As he got outside, it went to red only and then suddenly dropped immediately straight down and out of view at high speed.  Much much faster than a landing plane or a helicopter could safely do. Worth noting that not long after a legitimate plane flew across the sky at normal plane speed with normal blinking lights.  Completely different to what we had just witnessed.
