((anonymous report));2018-03-22 00:45:00;2:30;Boomerang/chevron shape covered in bright green lights - hovering in place for over an hour  no sound It appeared at a height between ground level and 30’ - my deck is 10’ from the ground so 20 or so - it had 3 shapes to it.  A boomerang shape with the curved tip facing on an angle downward and it was outlined in small green lights. To my eye it appeared there were 2 of them, could be described as chevron shapes - outlined in green facing angled downward.  Attached and above another boomerang shape with curve facing upwards.  This was also covered in small green lights but the top chevron/boomerang had 2 bright yellow lights right to each side of the top of the curve of the boomerang. Between the top and the bottom a the bottom of the top boomerang was a res ((sic. Red?)) light that flashed  This hung in the sky for over an hour right next to my house without making any sound.  It was no sound in the ambient background and there was no sound of worrying for my propeller or any machinery and when it turned it did not make a sound and when he darted back-and-forth it made no sound but it changed shape as it turned from the side it almost looked like a dragonfly because of the boomerangs.
