Its diameter was big enough to fit a couple of good sized houses under it.  Had windows, all the way around the top part, which kept changing colors.  Had many small lights around the outside edge on its underside,and it had larger lights in the center.  It made NO sound at all.  We watched it tip then right itself a couple times then it took off so fast it amazed us.  We were at St. Mary's beach watching this amazing thing. It was a saucer shape with a domed top, which had opaque windows around the domed top which kept changing colors.  My husband is an Art Teacher and an Artist, and I am a Hypnotherapist and artist.  I was 27 at the time and he was 35. There were other people there, in their cars, but I don't know if they saw it too.  I hoovered over a house for quite a while, made absolutely no sound at all.  It had tinny lights around the bottom edge, and I don't remember how many larger lights at the center of the bottom of it.  St. Mary's is an area where there are large old homes, some newer ones, and it is right on the water.;41.1906331460674;-73.1930814606741
