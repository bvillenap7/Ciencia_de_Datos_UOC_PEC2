Woke up because of the wind.  Took a few pictures of the clouds, so I've noticed the sky this morning.  Then noticed a very bright, white light, diamond shape object appear over the trees straight outside my window (I'm up on a hill).  Passed it off as a plane maybe towards Stratford, but it was moving too fast.   It hovered for a few minutes, I captured a bad video of that for about a minute.  Then it appeared to be moving again and then red lights could be seen and it moved behind trees.  Haven't seen it since.;41.1906331460674;-73.1930814606741
