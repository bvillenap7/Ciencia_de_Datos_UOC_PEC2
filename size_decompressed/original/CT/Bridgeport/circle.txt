I am writing this because when I tell people(very few) they think I am making it up but I know what I saw and felt.I'm glad I found this site. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

How could noone else have saw this.  It was bigger than the moon.   It was Orangey yellow.  Maybee cause it was 2am.;1995-06-15 02:00:00;30 MINUTES;How could noone else have saw this.  It was bigger than the moon.   It was Orangey yellow.  Maybee cause it was 2am. I can't beleive that no one else saw what I saw on this night.   It was about two in the morning. I am not sure of the exact year or date of this event.  I just know that it was late summer and the year was either 1995 or 1996.  I was looking for a place to kick it with this girl I was seeing at the time.  So we pulled up to a poplular spot to hang out on the ocean near captains cove.   The moon was about full and there was an object in the sky that was orangey yellow.  It was on the other side of the sky.  It was a perfect circle.   Larger than the moon.   We watched it for about a half hour.  Every minute it would get smaller and smaller.  It maintained a perfect cirlce shape.  And finally it got to the size of a star and then dissapeared.   This object didn't move.  It just simpley shrunk into nothing.  It was so big that I cannot believe that anyone did not see it.;41.1906331460674;-73.1930814606741
The Advocate newspaper(Stamford)front page news:UFOs in Stamford?(Sun.Oct.10th,1999)A half dozen witnesses saw circular shaped object;1999-10-03 15:30:00;1/2 of an hour;The Advocate newspaper(Stamford)front page news:UFOs in Stamford?(Sun.Oct.10th,1999)A half dozen witnesses saw circular shaped object over Long Island Sound on Oct.3rd,between 3:30 to 4:00PMboom rocked StamfordPolice were called no apparent cause. The Stamford's Advocate newspaper (Sun.Oct.10th)edition reported in its front page about an unexplained boom that rockedthe city of Stamford the previous weekend, that might have been connected to reported sightings of a circular shaped UFO over the coast of Wesport(CT) earlier that day. The boom rattled some windows,around certain neighborhoods in the city of Stamford. Also, residents of close by cities: Darien,Norwalk,and Danbury, reported flashing lights in the sky before the boom. Frank Fedeli,a supervisor of Stamford Citizens Services Center,said:it sounded like blasting,like the noise of an excavating machine...the windows rattle,like a boom,and it was gone. The Stamford police received many calls,but they,and firemen,did not find anything odd. City officials guessed it might have been a small earthquake,or sonic boom from aircraft. However, airports and the National Earthquake Information did not detected anything unusual.;41.1906331460674;-73.1930814606741
Black Rock UFO;2007-05-26 00:00:00;20;Black Rock UFO ( Blach Rock Community of Bridgeport, Ct.) During a 20 minute duration, my eldest son and I observed three round craft that illuminated a dull greenish color hovering silently left to right up the coast. Each craft followed the next about five minutes behind. They seemed to be roughly two-hundred feet above ground level. I contacted the Bridgeport police and news 12. This is not the first time we have witnessed these types of flying objects. I believe that life as we have known it is about to be changed forever...

I saw 6 glowing orbs lining up in different formations witin a 2 hour period over Long Island Sound.;2008-10-11 19:00:00;2 hours;I saw 6 glowing orbs lining up in different formations witin a 2 hour period over Long Island Sound. On 10/11/08, at 7pm on a Saturday evening, I was relaxing at Seaside Park in Bridgeport, Ct. As I gazed out over Long Island sound, looking southeast toward Port Jefferson, NY, I noticed 6 bright lights hovering over the Port Jefferson area. The lights resembled glowing orbs, and appeared to be about 500 feet above the horizon. These orbs were fading and then glowing, moving up and down, and from side to side. I watched for over 1 hour as the orbs lined up to change position to set up different formations. After about 1+1/2 hours, 3 of the orbs faded and disappeared from view. The remaining 3 orbs formed a straight line, and then 1 more also faded from view. After about 20 minutes, the last 2 lights faded away as well, leaving a clear sky, and only the stars remained.;41.1906331460674;-73.1930814606741
On JN 29 between 22:30 and 23:00 hrs while viewing the NE sky, observed 2 circular objects the size of a dime with a faint aura;2011-06-29 22:45:00;8 to 10 sec;On 06/29/2011 between 22:30 and 23:00 hours while viewing the NE sky, observed two circular objects the size of a dime with a faint aura Just for the purpose of credibility, I will begin by stating that I'm a retired Police Officer, trained in observation technics and the reporting of said observations. My wife and I were sitting in our rear yard between 22:30 and 23:00 hours, enjoying the cool summer night air.  We have several motion detection lights around the yard which had activated, thus flooding the yard with light.  My wife had a long busy day and stated that she was going to retire to bed.  Since it was such a clear and starry night, I urged her to remain still for a bit, and let the motion detector lights shut off so that we could get a good look at the stars before we retired for the night. After a short time with the lights off and as we gazed at the stars in a northeasterly direction my wife noticed the big dipper off to our left.  I turned my head left to the northwest to look towards the dipper and just as I was turning back towards the northeastern sky I observed two circular objects the size of a dime, in relation to the sky, with a faint orange glow silently flying or floating across the night sky.  They were coming from a northwesterly direction and heading east towards the Long Island Sound.  The objects were in close and perfect unison, approximately an inch apart in the night sky and at about 45 degrees above the horizon.  The orange glow was brighter on the forward sides of the circles and lightened up towards the rear or left sides of the circles.  My observation lasted about 8 to 10 seconds before they passed behind a large tree and were then out of sight. I turned to my wife and asked if she had seen the objects and she replied yes.  I then asked her what she thought they were.  She was quite spooked, shrugged her shoulders and questioned, A helicopter?  I replied, Did you hear any noise, and she hesitantly replied, no. Upon discussing this occurrence, I asked my wife why she replied that it was a helicopter and she stated,  Because I've never seen anything else fly so low in the sky before.    Neither of us, my wife 61 years old and I 58 have ever in our lives seen anything like this, we both concluded that we had just observed a UFO. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found him to be an exceptionally objective, and eloquent, individual.  We suspect that he is an excellent witness, and quite capable of reporting accurately what he and his wife had observed.  PD));41.1906331460674;-73.1930814606741

A large red ball descending at an extremely rapid rate of speed from very high above larger and faster than planes disappearing .;2019-11-04 19:00:00;7 seconds;A large red ball descending at an extremely rapid rate of speed from very high above larger and faster than planes disappearing . I witnessed from the terrace of my apartment in Bridgeport, Connecticut, in the southern part of the sky a red ball about the size of a quarter of the moon that night fly from east to west at a downward trajectory from the top of the trees about the same height of the moon whiz at a high rate of speed downward and disappear.  It was unlike anything I had ever seen and I am a constant watcher of the night skies.  It lasted about seven seconds.  Planes go by all the time and fly horizontally and look like specs.  This was large, came out of nowhere almost as if it came from another dimension.  It disappears out of my sight line and although I watched for a while longer did not reappear. I am sixty year old and not prone to fantasies.  I love looking at constellations and planets.  For instance I can see Orion and Jupiter from my terrace.  I worked as an administrative assistant and taught children.  I currently take care of my 82 year old mother.  When I was young our school had a planetarium which started my fascination with the night sky.;41.1906331460674;-73.1930814606741
