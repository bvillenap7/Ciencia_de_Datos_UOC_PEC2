Orange Reddish Orbs/Stars;2012-01-08 20:30:00;7 min;Orange Reddish Orbs/Stars Sunday 1/8/2012 around 8:30 PM my family and I saw what looked like orange reddish stars/orbs in the outline of a P.  We were just chatting and were coming from a small family gathering. My daughte saw it first and said, Whatâ€™s THAT????   Then my family looked and they were all like what is that??  We tried to get my husband to take a cell phone picture, but he was fumbling around and nervous and then the stars or orbs just started disappearing one by one.  It was a huge P.   All the other stars that were scattered around looked normal white.  These lights were orange reddish. The next day at the funeral reception we asked my godson if he saw anything.  He said his friend saw what he thought were UFOs and they were reddish.;41.1906331460674;-73.1930814606741
