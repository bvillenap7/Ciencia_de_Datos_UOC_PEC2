On a whim, I just visited the website ufos in Connecticut because I saw a news bit on tv about a recent British report declassification. I was amazed to see a listing of a sighting from 1969 that was just like what I experienced as a boy. It has been a long time but I remember it like this.  I was playing in the yard at night with three other children who lived in the house next door. This was in Kent in the 1970's and it was very rural and quiet there.  It was a very still and clear night. We were playing hide and seek and happened to be in a group in the center of the yard. I was about 12. The other boy, ((name deleted)), was my age and his twin sisters were about 10. The yard is surrounded by dense trees so it is impossible to see more than 50 yards in any one direction. Basically, the only way to look any distance is staight up. We were standing there and a flying object came over so low I remember it was maybe a couple hundred yards higher than the tallest elm trees.  It was multicolored and disc shaped. The multicolors seemed to spin as if the disc was spinning. But I remember that just the colors were spinning. The craft itself was not spinning and this was evident because flames were shooting out the back.  Just like the short report I just read, it was very silent except for a deep muffled sound which sounding like flames burning. It flew right over the house and disappeared. We ran inside to tell our parents, who were enjoying cocktails together. I remember my mother simply dismissing it as an airplane and we could not convince them of what we saw. I was very surprised to see the description from Bristol, Ct. It was very similar to my experience.;41.7337;-73.4608
