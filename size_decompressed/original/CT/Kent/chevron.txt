Huge, soundless, V shaped craft seen in Kent,CT.;1989-05-15 22:30:00;2 minutes;Huge, soundless, V shaped craft seen in Kent,CT. After reading about others who have spotted a similar craft I thought I would mention this siting that took place when I was a Senior in High School. My roomate and I were coming back from a late night run and as we came back to campus we noticed an object moving from east to west near Mt.Algo in Kent,CT. The object made absolutely no sound, it had 5 white lights underneath in a V shape, it moved extreemly slowly. Two other witnesses were present, a teacher and another student. We were all just standing there staring at this thing as it slowly slipped behind Mt. Algo. The thing that seemed most strange to us was that it was HUGE and yet made no sound! ((NUFORC Note:  We will attempt to have the witness have the other witnesses submit reports, as well.  PD));41.7337;-73.4608
