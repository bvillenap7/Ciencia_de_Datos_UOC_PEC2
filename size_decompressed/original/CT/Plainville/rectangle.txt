Rectangular object moving across the sky.;2010-01-15 23:40:00;30 Seconds;Rectangular object moving across the sky. My Girlfriend and I went out on the porch to have a cigarette and she said (What the hell is that?). I looked up in the northwestern sky and saw a very large rectangular object that seemed to be about 1000 feet up.It was about 100Ft. long by about 75 Ft. wide. It had four light orange lights, one on each corner with a solid beam. It was moving to the southeast at a moderate rate of speed. I would say a little faster than a jetliner. We could hear no noise at all, which we both found very strange. I ran in to get my camera but by the time I came out (about 15 seconds) it was to far away to capture on film. My Girlfriend does not believe in UFOâ€™s, but she is definitely starting to after last night.;41.6742;-72.8694
