Was driving past Tunxis Community College, on my way back from Bristol Walmart, and happened to catch a glow of light as I looked up.  I proceeded down Plainville Ave. past Tunxis, when I looked in my rearview mirror and saw a very bizarre irregular black craft, low flying in the sky.   I pulled my car over to get a better look when I noticed a very bizarre shaped craft with two red blinking lights one on top and one on the bottom of this object.  I have never seen anything quite like it in my life.  Perhaps it was a drone of some kind?  It proceeded very slowly to move west towards Bristol and out of view.   I could not estimate size of object  other than it appeared irregular in shape, with two blinking red lights.;41.6742;-72.8694
