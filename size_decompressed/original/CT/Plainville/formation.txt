As I got closer the lights flew over the Trumbull Ave. neighborhood and then headed near the YMCA along Rte 10 North bound, over the cemetery and towards the area of Robertson Airport.   This object seem to change shape to a butterfly with colored lights when it was near the YMCA, but went back straight line of white lights.  Lost view of it as it flew North.;41.6742;-72.8694
