2 discs moving by commercial planes at rapid pace.;2017-07-17 20:20:00;5 minutes;2 Discs moving by commercial planes at rapid pace. Me and my friend were sitting out side having a smoke.  We are on the approach for Boston Airport.  The last few nights we have see lines of jets flying to Boston as always.   Tonight, we saw the flights as always but with a twist.  There were 2 saucer like disks, a bit larger than the commercial flights going along abreast, a lot higher than the planes.   No sound or lights, just a reflection from the setting sun.   It passed 2 airlines like they were traveling 2 times there speed.   We have had a bunch of sightings in the last 2 months!;41.6742;-72.8694
