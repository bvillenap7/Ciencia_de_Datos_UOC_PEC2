Huge fireball with a firey tail shooting across the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor.  PD));2011-01-29 20:30:00;3 seconds;Huge fireball with a firey tail shooting across the sky I was at my kitched sink looking out the window when I saw a HUGE fireball shooting across the sky.  It had a tail and although I thought I'd hear a crask, I didn't.  It just disappeared or burned up.  I seemed really close, the closest shooting star I ever saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor.

Pretty bright light, like a star coming down from the sky, just seconds. This is the second time i see it, in the same place.;2012-02-04 22:28:00;3 seconds;Pretty bright light, like a star coming down from the sky, just seconds.
