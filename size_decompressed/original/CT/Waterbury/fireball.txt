2nd Witness: Large bluegreen fireball fell acrosss the sky in Fairfield Connecticut;2006-10-14 02:00:00;5 seconds;2nd Witness: Large bluegreen fireball fell acrosss the sky in Fairfield Connecticut I was driving home from a late night poker game around 2am on 10/14/2006.  I was driving east on I-84 through Waterbury, CT and in my left peripheral vision I noticed a moving light.  I looked over and it appeared to be a shooting star.  It was actually kind of startling, as it did not burn out and looked like it was coming at me.  Then, it looked like it blew up, similar to the ending of a firework.  It was very brilliant, but startling.  I didn't think much of it and just settled on the fact that I was tired, had a couple drinks, and it was probably just a firework.  I told some people and they thought I was crazy.  Recently I was looking up the UFO event at the Chicago airport.  I found this site and started looking through some of the reports and noticed someone else had seen the fireball at the same time and date.  Man I am glad someone else saw it, I thought was hallucinating.  As the other report said, it was VERY visually stunning but frightening at the same time.  I really looked like it was coming at me.  I hope to see another one again in my lifetime!;41.5582925619835;-73.0414570247933
Deep Red Perfect Circle shaped object hovering in the sky;2008-11-02 20:51:00;8 minutes;Deep Red Perfect Circle shaped object hovering in the sky My Husband was taking the dog out for a walk and shouted to me to come outside, I went outside and above the Waterbury/Watertown line was a red circle hovering over our culdesac area.  The circle had a deep red tone to it and did not flash.  We watched it for about 8 or 9 minutes and the circle only started to move after about 7 minutes.  It did a zigzag to the left, then to the right-as it slightly turned you could view a white flicker(a light of some sort for a split second) then it slowly faded off into the air as it moved off into the night.  During this time, we had taken video with our digital camera and my husband was able to take a clip of it with the actual video camera.  We were able to get about 5 or 6 minutes of straight footage of this with the digital camera.  This was in no way anything like we've ever seen before.;41.5582925619835;-73.0414570247933
Orange lights over waterbury CT;2011-07-30 22:54:00;ten minutes;Orange lights over Waterbury,  CT While driving home from work, I noticed  8 or more orange circles flying single file after another in an eliptical form. (curving)  They flew from the right side of the sky and curved to the left.  They were orange flame in color and slient yet perfectly round.  About the size of a grapfruit. I pulled over and watched with 3 other witnesses in another vehicle.  They had a still photo of the craft, whereas I had a few seconds of video on my camera phone.  Amazing sight!

At about 9 PM, we saw a fireball moving slowly across the sky through our bedroom window.  We went outside to observe.  It hovered for about 30 seconds, then proceeded, turning, and traveling southeast.  It disappeared beyond the tree-line, then returned a few minutes later.  It traveled over our street again, then turned and disappeared in the same direction as before.;41.5582925619835;-73.0414570247933

BIG flaming fireballs in the night sky.;2014-06-01 22:25:00;15 seconds (twice);BIG flaming fireballs in the night sky Was watching TV with the lights off when I could see a bright reddish/orange light through the blinds at 10:25PM.   I looked out the window and saw what looked like a flaming fireball drifting across the sky. Not a orb or a lantern.  It had no solid shape as far as I could tell.   I watched it drift sideways and it vanished.   While I'm standing at the window texting my friends about this freaky thing I saw, it came again at 10:45PM.  Exactly the same type of object moving exactly the same way along the same path until it vanished in exactly the same area as the first one.  I stood there for another hour and saw nothing but planes high in the sky circling the area that I saw this.   They left no trail and didn't move up or down, just sideways.;41.5582925619835;-73.0414570247933
