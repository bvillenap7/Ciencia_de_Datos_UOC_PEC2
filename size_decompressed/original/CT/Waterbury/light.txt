VERTICAL FLYING CRAFT DISAPEARING INTO SPACE.;1999-06-15 20:00:00;15 MINUTES;VERTICAL FLYING CRAFT DISAPEARING INTO SPACE. WHILE SITTING IN A PARKING LOT OF A SHOPPING CENTER I WAS FACING SOUTH. I OBSERVED A LIGHT WHICH I THOUGHT WAS AN AIRCRAFT FLYING NORTHWARD. AS I WATHCHED THE LIGHT IT SEEMED TO BE HEADING TOWARDS ME. AS I WATCHED IT I NOTICED THAT THE LIGHT WAS NOT GETTING CLOSER BUT ACTUALLY MOVING VERTICALLY. I WATCHED THE LIGHT AS IT BECAME SMALLER AND DISAPEARED, OR THE LIGHT BECAME TO SMALL TO SEE. TO THIS DAY I KNOW IT WAS NOT AN AIRCRAFT OR A SATTELITE. AT LEAST NONE THAT I KNOW OF. ((NUFORC Note:  Date in June 1999 is approximate.  PD));41.5582925619835;-73.0414570247933
Waterbury, Middlebury Space Craft?;2006-09-12 22:00:00;1 hour;Waterbury, Middlebury Space Craft? (I am just explaining what i have seen.) My friend and I were walking around our school campus. Then we started talking and i told him what i saw. He explained to me he has seen alot of wierd things in this area. I pointed to where i have seen this object before but never thought anything of it. In defiantly the object was still there i was like this is impossible. I said to myself it has to be a cell phone tower at the bottom of the hill here. But the object was no where near the cell phone tower. Then it started to move in a circler up and down motion. The object seem to be appearing over the I-84 and Middlebury area. Then we looked away for a minute to talk and then we turned our heads again to look at the object it was gone. Now i started to get wierd feelings inside me like wow. I always kinda thought there could be someting out there but never in our solar system. Now i think its defiantly true. ADDED INFO- I have seen this object before in the Past year.;41.5582925619835;-73.0414570247933
