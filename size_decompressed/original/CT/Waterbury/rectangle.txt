HUGE rectangular object over downtown Waterbury in 1996/1997;1996-08-01 21:00:00;5-10 minutes;HUGE rectangular object over downtown Waterbury in 1996/1997 I was leaving an evening class at an area high school when I noticed what I thought was an airplane at first off in the distance over some homes.  I was walking to my car across a parking lot and it get getting bigger as it came closer. By the time I got to my car, it was across the street over some houses and I couldn't believe what I was seeing. It was big then with windows and lights along the sides (blue,white,green,red). The lights blinked in a type of sequence. I continued to get into my car and drive home, taking a left out of the parking lot and heading to a stop light where I just stared and couldn't take my eyes off of it. It was on my right side at this point, so I couldn't see much of it because it was so huge.  I drove down the street to get on the highwayand it was on my left side now. It looked like a building laying on it's side.  I drove to my mom's home to get my kids so fast that night that I don't even remember getting there. I told her, but she thought I was crazy.  I didn't sleep for a long time after that. I never heard of anyone seeing it over the city and I can't understand how nobody else saw it. It was huge.  I really just want to know if there is anyone that may have seen it too. I never heard any sounds coming from it either.;41.5582925619835;-73.0414570247933

Was looking for space station and saw a blinking white shape in the sky that did not seem to be moving, then started to move downwards slowly.  It was rectangular in shape with twinkling white lights.;41.5582925619835;-73.0414570247933
