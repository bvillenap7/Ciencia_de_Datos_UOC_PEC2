From our back porch was noticed an egg shaped object slowly flying in a straight path in a SSW direction.  The object was traveling at a high altitude slower than an airliner.  The object was below a line of rippled clouds and ascended into this line cloud as it gained altitude. I took out my binoculars for a better view, and the object had a shiny type material as it could be seen with the sun hitting the object.  The object the ascended into the cloud and disappeared as it did not come out of the other side of the cloud.   Also, after the objects disappearance, I noticed an airliner flying in a flight path that is not usually flown where I live.  This airliner had its after burn exhaust on for a short time.  I did not notice any course correction from this airliner.   The typical flight path where I live is in a NNE direction.;41.5582925619835;-73.0414570247933

I try to record the event but I was shaking and didn't want to lose the ufo.;41.5582925619835;-73.0414570247933
