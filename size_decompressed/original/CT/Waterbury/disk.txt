I witnessed an abduction from my backyard.;2002-07-08 18:00:00;10 min.;I witnessed an abduction from my backyard. I was playing in my backyard at 6:00 and suddenly I saw something in the sky.  I watched the craft as it wobbled around then a light came out from it. The light was so bright that I had to turn away.  I looked at it again and it shot upwards with screaming coming out of it.;41.5582925619835;-73.0414570247933
We saw something I can't explain.....;2003-10-13 23:00:00;10 seconds;We saw something I can't explain..... As my brother and I and another friend were returning from a fishing trip in Riverton CT.on the Farmington river we were returning south on Route 8 and as we came over a rise in the highway on the left hand side we saw above a power station two objects saucer like in shape hovering above the station one closer than the other by approx 1/4 mile.We had the radio on and all of a sudden we saw the closest object veer off almost like a shooting star and combine as one with the distant object and instantly disapear,as all this was happening I was driving and checking the radio static and trying to pull over we all saw this happening in approx 5 or 6 seconds.I was amazed to say the least and we got off the first southbound exit and turned back on Northbound Route 8 to see if we could see more..We pulled over for 20 minutes and scanned the skyline to no avail.It was not from this world as I know it.I am going back their tonight after dark.;41.5582925619835;-73.0414570247933
Four yellow/orange lights over Waterbury, CT on 7/04/2011 about 11:00pm;2011-07-04 23:00:00;5 minutes;Four yellow/orange lights over Waterbury, CT on 7/04/2011 about 11:00pm After watching the Fireworks at Municipal Stadium in Waterbury, CT on July 4, 2011, which ended about 10:00pm,   I had gone inside our home and my husband had stayed outside to listen to the neighbors fireworks and make sure nothing came at our home.   At about 11:00pm - he came inside and said you have to see what is in the sky.  I went with him outside and we watched 4 things in the sky above.  They were moving very slowly in a formation.  One in front, two on the outside and one in back.  They were yellow/orange color.   I went inside to get our camera and my husband hollered - three disappeared just like that and as I got outside the last one was almost gone.   Wish we had a cell phone w/camera but we don't.  My husband is retired/disabled and I work full time.  We have never seen anything like this before. I've been checking online if anyone else seen them - but don't find anything except to post to this website.;41.5582925619835;-73.0414570247933
What's flying over the Clock Tower in Waterbury?;2012-05-06 23:39:00;15 miuts;What's flying over the Clock Tower in Waterbury? I wented a photograph of the Waterury Clock Tower and the city of Waterury, CT. I drove to Waterbury Hospital on a hill to shoot towards the tower. I didn't really notice anything unusual. Just a clear starry night. I took the first photograph and somethig didn't hit me right. I looked at the back of the camera and there were specks on the picture. I sword I tripoded should of been clear. So I went to whip out a lens cleaner and a white car with a black gentlemen in an expensive suit drove up. He asked what I was doing? I told him, I wanted a night time shot of the Clock Twoer and Waterbury. He said,Oh, Alright then... Be careful. then drove off. I drove to several more locations taking photographs. I think I have these ojects in at least 10 photographs. I'm a professional photographer. I have photographed at night. I repointed the camera and clicked off three more photos after the man left.  Then I left that spot.  Specks in all of them. I was disappoited! . Then drove to a street across the street from Kennedy HS:  Saw a view of the city. Took some shots. Also Off of congress st and that area.. In one of the photos  noticed what I thought was a thumb spot. With what looked like vapor coming from ehind the tree. I checked the lens it was clear. I Cotinued on my way to Wall St. I spent two hours photographing that night. I didn't go up to Holy Land the area spooked me so I turned around. I would shoot and something would just hit me wrong so I'd back up take another shot. So many locations I have three shots of the same photograph. I just figured I sort it out when I got home. I got home looked at the back of the camera noticed the specks pulled it in. It wa 3:00am now. I thought I was seeing things. Went to ed put the photographs on the computer called teh newspaper. They said in light of what happened at Banta Lake two weeks prior they wanted to see the photos. I asked what happened? She thought I was kidding. I told her I do! n't watch much t or read the newspaper. I go to the library. I! 'm a rea der. She asked to see the photographs.I e-mailed them to the newspaper. She said there photographer said street light. I told them he didn't know what he was speaking about. She said wind dust motion. Then she said,I really think you need to send these off to nasa. I did. My friend directed me to this website and suggested reporting it. I didn't see anything unusual. Except a man in very well dressed at 11:30 pm. I have extremely good hearing. I was bothered that I didn't hear his car. Come or go for that matter. I also didn't recall seeing his car in the parking lot or leave it. Very unusual for me. Especially at that hour of night. When I would look up at the sky it just seemed like bright yellow stars. Maye a bit brighter than normal. But Not sure as we've had so much rain it could of just seemed brighter. When these photographs are blown up you can make out a ring of what appears to be bright light around a disk like object. I really thought it looked almost mirror im! age in one shot when I blew it up I realized there wre more. I intially thought 3-4. But I realized there were 9-11. I wen tout to get these photographs for my sisters website. Her book will be coming out in Jan. So I really needed these to be spotless. I just wanted city shots and go home. On some level I think I was processing something wasn't just right as I was gettig annoyed by the crap coming across the lens. It definitely made for a longer night than I anticipated. I can literally recall thinking now I've got extra work to photoshop this crap out of here! Great! Once I saw what I had I did't touch those photographs. That's it. Sorry not much help. It seems there are different shapes ad also from a photograph on your site I may have more of them than I originally thought in these photographs. Also, I didn't really hear anything. Other than it wa a very busy night for the police it seems. The sirenes were laring it seems all night long. Which was wierd. I don't really! recall seeing a lot of people out. But the cop cars were ever! ywhere i t seemed. Especially in the Wall Street and Cook Street areas of the city. I do rememer turning off the car radio because of static. Also, I did notice a lot of yellow and blue stars in the sky that night;41.5582925619835;-73.0414570247933
