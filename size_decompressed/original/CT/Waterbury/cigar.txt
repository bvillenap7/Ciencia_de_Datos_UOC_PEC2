It seemed to turn in the sky when I first saw it, but as I kept watching it remained stationary for some time neither going forward nor backward.   We were driving so the object kept moving in the window and I had to really make an effort to pick it back up in the sky.   It was a clear blue sky with no clouds at all.   We exited to get gas and I lost it on the exit ramp and when we finally stopped about two minutes later, there was nothing in the sky at all.  It should be noted that there was NO air traffic in the sky at the time and there wasn't for some time after.  I did some looking online and my object looks exactly like the one posted for the incident outside of Stratford, CT on March 18th.  There is photo posted at http://ufoinfo.com/sightings/usa/070318.shtml.  It was cigar shaped and white with no other distingushing characteristics.;41.5582925619835;-73.0414570247933
