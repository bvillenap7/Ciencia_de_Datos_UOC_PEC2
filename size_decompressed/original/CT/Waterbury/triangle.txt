5 orange lights, triangular formation, no noise, rose straight from the ground and took off quickly.;2010-07-04 22:00:00;5 minutes;5 orange lights, triangular formation, no noise, rose straight from the ground and took off quickly I was with my boyfriend on the fourth of July in 2010. We had been watching fireworks from his rooftop.  His house is in the most elevated part of the city, so we could see fireworks going off from all different directions.  Neither of us had done any drugs or drinking that night, so we know for sure what we saw.  Once the fireworks had ended, we stayed at the roof to look at the stars. All of the sudden, 5 orange lights, in a triangular formation, rose straight up from the ground in the far distance, but close enough for us to clearly see. It did not rise on an angle like a jet or plane would.  It &quothovered&quot for a few minutes while we watched in awe and wondered what it could be. It was clearly not any type of flare or firework because it has risen very slowly and did not descend.  Quickly, it took off across the sky and made no noise.  I have never seen an object move so quickly and it was clearly not a jet.  To this day we still talk about it and regret! not trying to take a video!;41.5582925619835;-73.0414570247933

Red, Green Flashing lights.  Occasional white light on the bottom. Yesterday around 6 pm my son and daughter and their friends were looking at sky with binoculars and said omg mom come see, I was busy doing things and didn't come out to look.  My son had said it was so cool, it has flashing lights, red, green, blue and occasionally white.   Yesterday evening I was out around 12am and seen something in the sky and it was so odd, it was doing circles over a 50 ft circumference.  I watched with my friend and then called my fianc√© and 2 neighbors out.  I had said the kids were saying they seen this around 6pm and I didn't think anything of it.  Figured it was their imaginations.  We watched this object going in circles back and forth across they sky until after 2am.   This morning I asked my son what he was looking at in his binoculars.  He said it was the coolest thing.  It was a black triangle, that had a red triangle in the black triangle and a black triangle in the red triangle.  He said it was spinning really fast while flying but thought it was a jet.  He said the lights alternated.  The red light was only that would stay solid and the green would flash bright and it just circled back in forth and the object was spinning.  My friend that was with me texted this morning to say one of her friends posted about an object going back and forth over the sky and they live in same area.;41.5582925619835;-73.0414570247933
Hovered then followed straight path SE, with a quiet humming noise.;2015-03-12 21:23:00;0:0:30;Hovered then followed straight path SE, with a quiet humming noise. A large triangle-shaped metallic textured object hovered, then went in a straight path. Edges could be seen, this was not like any plane.  There were blue lights on the three sides, very bright, no fluctuation.  One shape was seen, about a half a mile to a mile from treeline in my view. The background was treeline, and clear sky with some clouds.  No moon was out. And two other planes could be seen but not going the same way, the lights on these planes were different color and flashing prior to the one before.

Two triangular craft 15 car lengths apart above the traffic lights moving along 84 East for a bit near Waterbury;2019-02-19 21:00:00;5 minutes;Two triangular craft 15 car lengths apart above the traffic lights moving along 84 East for a bit near Waterbury Above the traffic lights on 84 East leaving Waterbury, approximately 6 to 8 stories above the ground.  Two small triangular crafts hovering in a forward trajectory faster than the car but not by much.  The two craft had a distance of approximately 15 car lengths between them with the second adjusting course relative to the lead craft.  The craft were not helicopters but might have been some advanced large triangular drones of some kind.  The craft were too low to be a plane in my opinion.;41.5582925619835;-73.0414570247933
