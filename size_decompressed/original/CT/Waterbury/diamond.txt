What Did I Just See!  Waterbury CT. 11/24/11;2011-11-24 16:45:00;5 min;What Did I Just See!  Waterbury CT. 11/24/11 On Thanksgiving night I hear my father who went out on my deck for a cigarette screaming to come outside.   As my wife, my father-in-law, and my mother and me run out we can see two bright orange lights hovering less than a mile from the house.  My father who doesn’t believe in anything like UFOs starts to tell us that these two lights have been there for a while.   Hearing my father explain this I can see he was very serious about these lights and I can hear the fear in his voice.  The rest of us can’t believe what we are seeing and start to question if it’s a helicopter (nope they are to close together and there’s no sound), flares (it would of went out by now,) whatever explanations we are trying to come up with it is being tossed out the window.   As we figure out what we are seeing the orange lights suddenly move to the right of us.  They move simultaneously together gracefully through the sky, we try to follow them bobbin are heads trying to see through the trees when all of sudden the lights disappear. We all look at each other laughing trying to explain what we have just seen.  A day goes by and I try to see if maybe the local news or news paper put something out there.  Nothing yet, I can’t believe we would be the only ones in town who have witnessed this event.  Either way it was definitely a  Thanksgiving night to remember!
