Oval hovering disk;2010-02-01 07:50:00;minute;Oval hovering disk I was driving in the car with my son just about to come down a hill where a decent part of the sky was clear in view with no trees.  The sky was sunny and clear with no clouds.  We both saw a oval disk shape hovering quite low and it looked 3D.  It was a two toned color tanish/silver with no lights or anything visible on it.  As I proceeded to the bottom of the hill it quickly zoomed off to the left and disapeared.  We have low flying aircraft all year long in this area and I have never seen anything quite like this.  It lasted about a minute and was North-East in the sky.;41.3434;-73.0806000000001
