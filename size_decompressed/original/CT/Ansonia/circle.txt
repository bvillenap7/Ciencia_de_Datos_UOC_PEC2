Huge ball of light.  ((NUFORC Note:  Meteor??  PD));2009-09-20 00:45:00;half minute;huge ball of light I was standing on the porch with a friend at about 12:45am when I spotted a huge (round) ball of light. It fell from the left to the right in a downward motion in the northern part of the sky facing Waterbury, CT.  It was larger than any other light I have ever seen in the night sky and it was aprox a quarter size of the moon.  It had no noise and no trail and was gone below the trees before I could even figure out what it could have been.  Very big and very bright and almost perfectly round in shape.  Wondering if other people who were not surrounded by trees got a longer, better look. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
