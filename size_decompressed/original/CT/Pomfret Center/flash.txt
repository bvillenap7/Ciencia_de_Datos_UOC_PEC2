Bright green flash of light causes dog to freak out.;2011-10-12 17:00:00;25 minutes;Bright green flash of light causes dog to freak out. Late at night, I was attempting to sleep.  I had my dog in my room, and soon after I closed the door, she started freaking out.  At first, she was just whining a bit, but I just tried to calm her down.  She eventually started pacing around and I started getting scared.  You know when you can feel something is there that you can't see and you get scared.  She eventually started whining more and more but I was too scared to move out of my bed to open the door.  All of a sudden, there was a bright green neon flash of light in the middle of my room.  My eyes were immediately drawn to it and I could see my dog in the corner of my eye sitting and staring right at it with the light bouncing off her eye.   After that, she went absolutely crazy and started scratching at the door.  I jumped right up and opened the door and ran out! ((NUFORC Note:  Date of alleged event may be approximate.
