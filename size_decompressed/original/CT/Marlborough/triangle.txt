3 red pulsating lights in a perfect triangle glide over Marlborough, CT;2009-02-25 18:00:00;10 minutes;3 red pulsating lights in a perfect triangle glide over Marlborough, CT 3 pulsating, red lights glided over Marlborough, CT.  No noise.  I was picking up a freind who lives less than a mile from my house. As I got out of my car, I noticed the lights gliding over his house. I am not sure if the lights were connected. I called my freind out to see the lights.  He agreed with me, that it was not helicopters, planes, baloons, stars or anything we could identify.  His son also witnessed the event. My freind insists that the lights were conected.  I am not sure. If they were connected, it was a very big object.  It was nothing we had ever seen before.  If anyone else saw this, or knows what it was.  Please let me know.;41.6358;-72.4668
