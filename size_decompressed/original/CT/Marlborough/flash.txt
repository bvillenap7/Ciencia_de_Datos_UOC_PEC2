Bright Bluish Flash seen from Marlborough/Glastonbury;2006-11-21 01:00:00;1 second;Bright Bluish Flash seen from Marlborough/Glastonbury Heading back to Glastonbury on Jones Hollow Rd. in Marlborough Ct my friend and I witnessed in the Northwest sky, at quite some distance near the horizon, a bright bluish/white flash. (very similar to lightning)  The sky was very clear. There were stars everywhere.  Not a cloud in sight.  It appeared to be far away but the light was very intense and it flashed for a second then went out.  My friend claims to have seen what he thinks was a smoke trail, but I did not see that.   We tried to guess at what it could have been.  We both dismissed lightning because the sky was so clear and the air was very cool.  I thought maybe a transformer but my friend thinks it was too high in the sky and too bright and we did not hear an explosion. (not that I think we would have because the windows were up)  We both ruled out a plane.  I have no idea what it was. It was strange.  Could it have been lightning?  Maybe.  But I dont think so.  I'm very curious to watch the local news and see it anyone else saw it.   Or maybe find out what it was.. If I do I'll post it here.
