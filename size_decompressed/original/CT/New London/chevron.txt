Sitting at traffic light tonight at intersection of Huntington and State Street in New London, CT.  This is the State of CT Superior Court House.   Heading North toward Hodges Square.  Drove down two lights to intersection of Huntington & Federal St.  See a very bright V-shaped object over my head.  Get glimpse, seems to have three bright white lights on one leg of the V and four bright lights on opposite leg of the V.  Dashcam video caught what I saw, just not in great detail. https://vid.me/BySl;41.3494999999999;-72.103
