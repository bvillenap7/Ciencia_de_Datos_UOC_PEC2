July 2nd, 3rd or 4th,  2010.   From a dock on the Connecticut shore a friend and I (60's, college educated, non-profit professionals) were looking up at the stars about 9 p.m. as the twilight was disappearing and the sky was becoming increasingly dark.  We were both looking  at about 10-10:30 o’clock out over Long Island Sound and simultaneously we caught sight of a very fast moving light that blinked and zigzagged and then disappeared.  It was probably in our visual field for no more than 3 seconds.  It was quite out of the ordinary and we both commented on it at the same time. While similar in brightness to a high flying airplane or satellite, it didn’t resemble any airplane or satellite I’ve seen before.  And neither of us thought it was a shooting star.  I’ve never seen an airplane or satellite or shooting star zigzag like this object did.  Because it moved in a fast, but measured, geometric pattern it seemed much more like a mechanical object than a natural phenomenon like a comet or shooting star.   We saw it a couple of weeks ago and I am still thinking about it, wondering what it is we saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.
