Unknown craft taunts airplane in night sky;2013-08-01 00:30:00;30 seconds;unknown craft taunts airplane in night sky I was outside walking dog, from the corner of my eye noticed something spinning in the northeastern sky above tree line. a normal airplane was flying north, while an unknown bright circular light was spinning around the airplane from head to tail perpendicularly.  the bright light was very fast, it circled around the plane for about 5-10 seconds, disappeared for 10 seconds while the normal airplane continued its journey north.  all of a sudden the white bright circular light shot out of the atmosphere at a roughly 40-50Â° angle from where the ufo and aircraft had orginally made contact.  and I know this because from where I was standing they were inbetween the constellations Puppis and Canis Major.;41.5717;-73.4915
