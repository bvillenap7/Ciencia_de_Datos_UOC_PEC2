The craft moved towards Tolland from Rockville much faster than a plane. It was an oval shape and looked about the size of a quarter from my perspective(obviously much larger). There was only one atleast that i noticed, it had a row of orange lights that moved back and forth on the craft which made a low humming noise. i Swa the craft at night and only a fwe stars wer visible.;41.8501;-72.4649
