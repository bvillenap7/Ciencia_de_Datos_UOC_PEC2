Greenish/White chevron shaped light flying over Avon,CT 3/25/2012;2012-03-25 22:45:00;10-15 minutes;Greenish/White chevron shaped light flying over Avon,CT 3/25/2012 On Saturday March 25, 2012 I was driving to my sister's house in Avon, Connecticut.  As I was driving North down Old Farms Road I noticed a greenish chevron shaped light flying over head.  This light was cloud level and flying in a circular shape over the same area. I observed this flying light for approximately 10-15 minutes as I was driving and then once I arrived at my sister's house as I was still able to see it.  When I told my sister about what I had saw she told me how she has noticed it also noting that she had seen it on Monday night 03/19/2012 and also she had seen it earlier in the night of 03/25/2012 around 18:30-19:00 hours. She was able to tell me exactly what I had saw in the sky as she described it as a greenish/white shape flying circles in the same area I had also seen it flying over.;41.7938;-72.8581
