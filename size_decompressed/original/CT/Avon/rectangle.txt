I spotted an object fifty feet in the air as large as a house. I was driving back to where I was staying that night after dropping off a friend, I was driving up a road in Avon CT. when I saw a bright light up ahead, I thought this was unusual for this time of night. I proceeded up the road and when I got to where the light basically was coming from there was no light present, I looked arond in curiousity and discoverd an object the size of a house hovering about fifty feet in the air, It was basically a half moon and visability was good, this object was very dark and large, there were no lights on and it made no noise what so ever. I parked my car in the middle of the road and left it running with the lights on hoping someone would come down the road to witness this as well. I stood still in one spot staring at this object for about 5 min fearing what it would be capable of doing. I looked around and saw a house that had it's lights on so I ran over to it and knocked on the door, I waited for a couple of minutes but nobody answerd, I ran back to where my car was and the object was still there. I became so scared I jumped in my car and drove off quickly, as I went to the stop sign at the end of the road I looked up and the object had followed me all the way down the road, I turned to the left and saw the object was still following me, I floored the gas and never looked back again, it took me over a month to tell anyone else but eventually I told my parents, we ended up moving to an area basically right where this event occured and a neighbor saw the same thing almost one year to date later, she described the exact same event I witnessed.;41.7938;-72.8581
