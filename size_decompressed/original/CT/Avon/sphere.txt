2 orange spheres on two consecutive nights.;2014-02-21 21:15:00;3-4 minutes;2 orange spheres on two consecutive nights Two orange spheres were seen traveling north.  I first observed the objects on 02/21/14 at 23:15 hrs.  They were seen again on 02/22/14 at the same time (nightly dog walk). On 2/21 the sky was hazy and no sound was heard.  They traveled from the south at a steady speed seeming to maintain a constant distance.  The objects turned east the southeast and faded from view about 20 sec. apart. On 2/22 the sky was clear and the objects appeared brighter and larger, almost moon sized.  They again traveled north this time veering to a north easterly heading.  The objects faded from view in a similar fashion as the previous night and again they traveled silent. On both occasions there was no indication of change in the indeterminate altitude only change in latitude, longitude and distance from vantage point were observed. Both nights the cell phone was on the charger and I did not capture images (did not expect to spot a second time).;41.7938;-72.8581
