((HOAX??))  Avon, CT UFO ID Software DooM Engine Open Source.;1995-10-05 17:00:00;10 minutes;Staples Avon, CT UFO ID Software DooM Engine Open Source When I was younger working at Hopmeadow Mall in Simsbury CT, I heard about a UFO sighting in Staples Avon CT location.  This was around 1999 when I heard of it.  I believe it occurred years earlier around 1995, though it may have been as early as 1990.  I had a friend who worked at Staples around 1998 who never told me of this event, though this person moved away shortly after working there. This may be of interest – this Staples used to be a popular location to buy computer games, especially the old ID Software Doom engine games.  This was before the engine went open source.  I cannot explain this connection and I doubt the person telling the account of this sighting knew this store used to be a popular location to buy ID Software product.  I don’t believe they have a large aisle selling games anymore. I believe this Staples used to have a steeple on the roof as well.
