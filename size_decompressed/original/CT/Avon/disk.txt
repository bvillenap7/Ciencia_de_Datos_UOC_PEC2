My mother and I were traveling a short route home (5 min. ride)from my grandparents house when at a stop sign at the intersection of Arch road and West Avon road A HUGE lit-up craft appeared out of nowhere at tree top height (approx. 50 feet) going very very slow over our car. We got out of the car a looked at it in amazement I have never seen anything like this in my life to date (this happened about 22 years ago I was about eleven, and remeber it very distinctivly). I had made mention that the craft was lit-up it had various colors of lights and was traveling at a very slow speed (running speed, 10 mph) it creeped over us heading in the direction of a cow field adjacent to the road we were on. no noise what so ever.

2 disk shaped objects flighting in formation over Connecticut;2011-06-04 12:40:00;4 seconds;2 disk shaped objects flighting in formation over Connecticut Around 12:40, my brother and I saw 2 round disk shaped objects flying silently in formation in a NW direction.   We had been lifeguarding at our local pool when we observed the sighting.  Generally, planes fly over the pool while approaching runway 6 at Bradley International Airport but you can always hear them even if you cannot see them.   These two objects were flying very low and right next to each other in formation.  We saw the objects for about 4 seconds before they disappeared behind the tree line.   About 15 minutes later, we observed a military helicopter (which was very load) circling the area where we had seen the objects flying.;41.7938;-72.8581
