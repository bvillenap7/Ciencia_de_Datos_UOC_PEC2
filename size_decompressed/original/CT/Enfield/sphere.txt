3 glowing sheres were interconnected and moved as one body.;1992-06-01 19:00:00;10 minutes;3 glowing sheres were interconnected and moved as one body. Right over the street about 100 feet in the air is a sight I will never forget.  My wife and I saw three glowing spheres of pure golden white light.  The middle sphere was the same size thereabout as the basketball hall of fame building in Springfield, Massachusetts.  The other two spheres were by its side and were much smaller.   You can’t really say one sphere was on the left and the other on the right because they were spheres.  All sides are continual and perpetual.  But from my perspective one small sphere was on the left and the other was on the right of the large sphere. This craft would oscillate its light and shimmer.  It moved from side to side and when the craft moved, all the spheres would move together as one body.  Their movement was as if the spheres were connected by some kind of rod, but no such thing was visible.   This was not your typical alien space craft.  It wasn’t a take me to your leader kind of craft like a round saucer plate with a bubble on top or a cigar shaped thing.  It wasn’t a weather balloon either.   I never believed that aliens or spaceships like this ever existed.  I never believed stories of space ship photos.  So now what do I do?  I am looking at an amazing space ship.   It made no sound, not even when it flew away.  And when it did fly away it moved in a beautiful graceful curvy pattern and just flew right up into the stars until it blended in with them and ultimately just disappeared from sight.  They were not in the earth’s atmosphere anymore.  They were in space.  They made it look so easy, and Nassau makes it look so hard and sloppy.   This happened on Sam St. Enfield, CT., 06082.  We were looking up at the craft in a north easterly direction.  It was practically 100 yards from us and about 100 feet in the air.  My best guess.  My wife said she saw this same craft when she was younger, a mere child, and I never belived her.  She was angry at the craft when it flew away saying she wanted the driver to get out and introduce himself.  She said his name is ((wife's name deleted)).
