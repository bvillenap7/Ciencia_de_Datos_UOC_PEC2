White, erratic flashing object, Enfield, CT.;2015-11-23 11:00:00;30 seconds;White erratic flashing object enfield Ct Object seemed a bit large and not a perfect shape as it was moving fast so hard to tell.  It moved in an erratic pattern like it was jumping.  It was  bright white and flashed in a clear bright cloudless blue sky.  It would disappear then flash again several times and then it just disappeared for good.  Definitely not a plane.   I could see this from interstate 91 south near the  shopping mall.  Saw this and it was just out of the ordinary so I had to go online to see if I could find anyone else that may have noticed it.   My description is female, 40's with college degree.
