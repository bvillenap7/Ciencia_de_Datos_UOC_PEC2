6 F-15's supersonic;2009-08-04 21:15:00;5 Minutes;6 F-15's supersonic My fiance and I were watching TV when we heard a very loud low rumble.  We muted the TV and continued to hear it. We ran out onto our porch.  The noise continued.  Approximatley 15 miles from us is an F-15 base (Barnes Air National Guard Base, Westfield, MA).  We saw 6 F-15's fly over with afterburners on.  This is not a normal occurance, they usually fly over during the day time, and unless at an airshow I have never seen them fly over with afterburners.  Particularly at night.  The other odd part about this incident was the fact that the aircraft were running only their red collision lights, not a typical red white green configuration.   I was wondering if you have recieved any additional reports from the area or of similar nature?  The F-15's certainly appeared to be going somewhere in a hurry.  The low rumble heard prior to the F-15's being seen was a different noise entirely from that of the aircraft.   Throughout the evening and as I am writing this report our TV has been having frequent interference and service interruptions. ((NUFORC Note:  We would welcome reports from any other witnesses to this event.  Six F-15's in the air at one time is a major event, and we would welcome reports from anyone who was witness to the exercise.  If there were news reports in the local media, we would be grateful if people would send us links, or the text of those reports.  Thank you!  PD));41.9911206349206;-72.5612476190476
