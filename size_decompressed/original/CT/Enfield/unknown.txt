7 floating red and blue lit crafts floated above Enfield CT;2012-09-14 20:00:00;15 minutes;7 floating red and blue lit crafts floated above Enfield CT Several crafts about the size of a small helicopter floated across the sky about 2 miles south of the Enfield mall.  Around 7-10 crafts with red, blue and white lights moved over head slowly. All of the crafts appeared to have direction as if they are manned.  Most of these flew just below the tree line over a field near Namco.  All of the crafts moved in the same general direction over the field and then down behind the tree line.  Four of them appeared to fly in formation.  Each seemed to almost be within a stone’s throw distance but every single one created no sound.  It was completely quite as they flew over.  The white light on the craft appeared to be on the front of each. While they were going over head I shined an iPhone camera light on and off toward one. It turned and began heading in my general direction. I then immediately shut off the light and it returned to its course.  Note: Just before the incident Myself and one other were on a walk. Several solar powered outside lights were speratically turning on and off which we found strange.;41.9911206349206;-72.5612476190476
15 Orange lights on horizon;2012-11-17 19:00:00;2 minutes;15 Orange lights on horizon Approximately 12-15 orange lights of varying intensities, some as bright as the planet Jupiter, others somewhat dimmer were viewed low in the West. The lights were seen near the waxing crescent moon low on the horizon in a random pattern. They were clearly visible even though they were only several degrees from the moon’s position. There were no flashing lights, no movement and no sounds. The lights remained stationary for the 2 minutes I stood to observe. The lights covered an area much too large to be on one vehicle they would have been individual vehicles. They covered an area in the sky that would be covered by an outstretched hand. I came back to the same spot 20 minutes later and they were gone.;41.9911206349206;-72.5612476190476
Unknown aircraft that dimmed and brightened when moving.;2014-03-25 23:30:00;20 minutes;unknown aircraft that dimmed and brightened when moving. Having received a call from a friend in Springfield, Massachusetts, that an object he saw was headed my way, I headed out to find the object and try to identify it as I am an aviation enthusiast.   I saw a few lights and was able to identify them as commercial aircraft.  But one light seemed to stay ahead of me.   I maintained visual contact with it in my car and finally got close enough in Broad Brook, Connecticut.  It had a bright pale yellow light and almost seemed to hover.   Very suddenly it got 10 times brighter, its color changing into a bright white light and it moved very rapidly towards me.  And as it drew very close, its color again dimmed to a pale yellow and it slowed almost into a hover.   It then proceeded to turn towards the northwest.  As it did, I saw it had 4 pale yellow lights with a red, blue, amber and green light next to each pale yellow light.  It leveled off, got very bright again, and took of so fast I lost contact.   This object was ! no commercial aircraft and it moved far too fast to be a helicopter or a tilt rotor aircraft such as an Osprey.   And note, no aircraft, civilian or military, has an amber light.

White or silver craft moving quickly at high altitude.  No trail.  Changed directions quickly.  ((anonymous report));2019-05-18 16:45:00;5 seconds;White or silver craft moving quickly at high altitude.  No trail.  Changed directions quickly. Saw a reflective white or silver craft flying high in the sky at high speed.  (Could not determine the shape clearly).  It Did not leave a trail behind it as it moved. I was laying down in my house looking north out my bay window and suddenly sat up when I saw something moving across the sky.  I saw up to watch the object fly by. It seemed very high up and was moving far too quickly to be any kind of commercial jet.  Also, the fact that it didn’t leave any trail behind it was odd.  It changed direction very quickly by about 30 degrees east of its original path, almost on a dime, and then disappeared over the trees. This was seen over the northeastern part of enfield.  Almost into long meadow. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.9911206349206;-72.5612476190476
