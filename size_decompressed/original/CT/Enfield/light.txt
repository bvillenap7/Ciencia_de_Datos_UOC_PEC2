PD));2012-06-18 22:20:00;1 minute;Bright light at high altitude and then fades.  Travelled slow like satellite but bright light was odd.  Too late for sun reflection Was out walking dog during clear night... Noticed bright light and thought it was a planet. It then faded and moved in a northern direction slowly like a satellite.  Could nit see any blinking lights or strobes that you would see on a plane.  It was at an extremely high altitude. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  Probably a sighting of the International Space Station, we suspect.

6 orange lights flying evenly apart in a row!;2014-05-17 22:07:00;4 minutes;6 orange lights flying evenly apart in a row! My daughter and I got home at 10:05pm last night.  As we were getting out of the car, I saw 4 bright orange lights moving across the sky at an altitude of a plane.  They were evenly spaced and flew across the sky in a perfect row at the speed of a plane flying by.   Then a fifth one appeared into sight more of a distance behind the first four.  Then a sixth one.   They passed in a line one following the other until out of sight behind the trees.  I thought they looked like Chinese lanterns but seemed to big at the altitude they were flying at.   I never saw anything like that before!;41.9911206349206;-72.5612476190476
Read sighting descriptionâ€¦  ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling star, we wonder?  PD));2014-08-10 23:00:00;1-2 hours;read sighting description .. Around 11:00 PM, me and my friend looked up and noticed a very bright object hovering at high altitudes in the airspace.  At first, we thought it was a star, but after looking at it for about 20 minutes we noticed the UFO was flashing, and very, very slowly moving across the sky.  The UFO had not left our sight until around 1:30 AM, when we noticed the object had disappeared out of the sky completely.  From about 11:00 PM - 1:30 PM, the UFO was just SLOWLY moving across the sky, until it disappeared from sight.  It was torturous to see, because I'll never know why the object was slowly hovering over my hometown for HOURS.  Maybe it was moving so slow to avoid detection by us humans, well, thats the only explanation I have for it. ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling star, we wonder?  PD));41.9911206349206;-72.5612476190476
