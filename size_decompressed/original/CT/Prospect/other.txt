A brief sighting of a grey crescent shaped object flying at night.;2013-11-28 18:35:00;10-15 seconds;A brief sighting of a grey crescent shaped object flying at night. On 11/28/13 at approximately 6:35PM, my cousin and I were outside and were in his neighborâ€™s yard in Prospect, CT.   As we were looking south east into the night sky without a cloud and clear visibility he pointed out an object to me.   I looked up and saw a dark grey crescent shaped object about the length of five full moons moving at a constant speed southward.  We only saw the object for roughly 10-15 seconds and it remained at the same altitude.  It did not make any noise and was entirely silent.  The sides of the object both ended in a jagged point and were not round.   After the incident we hurried inside and contacted the NUFORC.;41.5022;-72.9756
