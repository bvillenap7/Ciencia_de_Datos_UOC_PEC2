Saw object out of the corner of my eye,thought it was a kite. On closer look, noticed no side  to side movement or tail and it was solid black.   It just moved a very ,very slowly  upward toward cloud.  The clouds were light gray so the black object stood out sharply.   When I went in to get binoculars,it disappeared. I continued to work in my yard,glancing in the same southwest direction occasionally but it did not become visible again   Looked like these photos: http://www.ufosightingsdaily.com/2012/01/ufo-madeira-island-portugal-on-01-01.html ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
