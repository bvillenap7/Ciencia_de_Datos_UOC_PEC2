amazingly low flying silent craft witnessed ct;2008-01-29 20:32:00;25 seconds;amazingly low flying silent craft witnessed ct while driving down a major route my friend said look at that looking out the front widshield at 12 oclock high 40 feet above the ground a craft came over the vehicle from right to left the craft had numerous lights consisting of red,blue,white the vehicle was right above the tree line but we couldnt make out the shape another craft was directely behind the first one with a string of lights along the perimeter my friend assumed that we were looking at landing lights for a craft that was going to land in a field however after investigating this morning no field or landing sights were anywhere in the area. one thing I noticed was the airspeed of the craft seemed too slow for a conventional craft these things were the size of a cargo carrier without the roar of the engines these things were silent I am hoping that others maybe witnessed this and will report. I have noticed other strange lights while traveling route 32 on the mountain of franklin ct with no explenations;41.6131;-72.1425
