At 5:00 am, while my husband and I were strapping down our flatbed loads of potting soil, I had an urge to look up into the sky while I was winding up my strap. The sky was clear and full of stars.  As I was enjoying the crisp air and admiring the stars, I noticed two globes of light come into my field of vision from the north. I have never experienced a sighting like this before.  I am a new listener to Coast to Coast which is what caused me to be conscious enough to even look up to begin with. These two globes were white in color.  They were travelling in a southerly direction. At first, they were travelling side by side, going somewhat quickly across the sky.  The one on the right was travelling a pace behind the other.  It then sped up and crossed over the other one and took its place on the left side.  They both continued til out of sight. I'm not very good at judging distances, but if I had to guess, I'd say they were about 200 to 300 feet in the air.  I did not hear any noise, although my truck was idling, so I most likely would not have been able to hear it unless it was very loud. The only wordsI that I can think of to describe the behavior would be that they were like a couple of balls of energy that were buzzing around like insects, playing and racing.;41.6131;-72.1425
