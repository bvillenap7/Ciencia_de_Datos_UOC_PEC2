Communicating with a UFO in Barkhamsted CT;2020-07-14 23:50:00;6 minutes;Communicating with a UFO in Barkhamsted CT I was using a high powered flash light to shine on my woods when I accidentally pointed it at the sky. Within a second a very big circular object in the sky, slowly moving from East to west shined a very bright orange light back at me. When the light went out, it slowly dimmed.  This is when I got the attention of my friend.  I did it again and the object replied again. We did this back and forth for approximately 5 minutes.  I was able to catch two flashes on video.  The object never made a sound and was very high in altitude. No other lights present on the craft.  Just after we lost sight of the craft, my dog began the growl into the woods. We heard a large animal moving around in the woods but could not find it with a flashlight. This very well could have been any of the hundred animals that live in the woods here. However, it made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.;41.9266;-72.9187
