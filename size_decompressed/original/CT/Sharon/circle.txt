Sharon, CT, sphere 3 minutes bright lights after leaving ground, 3/12/15.;2015-03-12 03:40:00;3 minutes;Sharon CT, sphere 3 minutes bright lights after leaving ground, 3/12/15. I observed some lights on the ground on neighboring property as I went to the kitchen for some water.  I thought our neighbor behind us was sending out an early crew.   I  checked the time as I am curious how early he heads out, 3:40 am.   Then I look down at his house, no lights on.  Then my husband, who had gotten up to use the bathroom, calls to me come here.  I am not in a hurry, for reasons that don't need explanation.   I bring the dog in from his relief and go to the bedroom.  As I come in, my husband says, You missed it.  He is at the windows, crank out wide open, I say what a UFO and I see a single light disappear over the trees.   He says 10 to 12 lights in a formation as a sphere.  A drone?   In my quest on the internet, I don't find a connection.;41.8689;-73.456
