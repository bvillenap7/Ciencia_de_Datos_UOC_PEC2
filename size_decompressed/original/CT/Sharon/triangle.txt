Conn. silent  object;2009-01-23 05:20:00;7 min.;Conn. silent  object I left for work work and as I got to the lake at the end of the hill I saw a orange- white light and it was bright. So I stopped to take a look ( I have been working shift 12 hrs for 25 years so I know the morn. and night skyline ) I thought for kicks I would shine my high power flash light at it!  The object was stationary at the time after 3 to five Min's it started started to move form West to East toward me it passed just to my right it seamed to be about a half a mile up and to my best guess 60 ft. tip to tip.  As it went over I kept flashing the light at it. I waited 2 to 3 more Min's for a sound and there was nothing.  I am 55 years old served in the USN have no issues with the Government or Local enforcement. It has been 30 years since I have seen anything like this and then there was a witness and once and awhile I see her and she will never forget that for it was very close to this experience it was about 30 Min's long and ended in the same shaped vehicle but at a greater distance. If there is any report's you receive from northwest Ct. please foward to me thanks.;41.8689;-73.456
