White light thought was a star until it moved slowly then shot off into space.;2015-03-13 21:18:00;4:00;White light thought was a star until it moved slowly then shot off into space. Looking up at the stars as I often do at night, I saw a bright white light I thought was a star over the horizon.  Until it started to move in a clockwise motion from about 11:00 to the 2:00 position.   I thought it was a satellite as it was too high to be a plane when it just stopped at the 2:00 position.  It stayed there for about 3 or 4 minutes when it shot out of the sky so fast, it streaked and was gone in less than 3 seconds.;41.316090551181;-72.9269877952756
