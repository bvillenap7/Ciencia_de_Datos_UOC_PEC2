Viewed by most residents of Stewart Street Odject observed by Tweed New haven airport.I was watching cable TV which was just been installed in our area and the movie channel went fuzzy. suddenly we heard screams.  Our neighbors daughter saw the object and got scared.  My mother ran to the front door and Object was directly overhead at tree level. No sound except for ultralow humming/vibration My mother yells UFO!  So we run out side and the neighbors are out and were looking at this thing. I can directly see into window of craft. if someone were to be standingin window I would have clearly seen them.  Entire block witnessed event i was 13 yrs old at the time and cant put pieces of event together clearly. lost track of time of event. lived by airport for entire life and had witnessed blimps and other types of aircraft during annual air show this was nothing I have ever seen before.  Called airport and they told us they had hovercraftin the area. called local news and they never showed up. I know hover craft.

Small Sphere traveled very low, very smoothly, and then danced out of sight.;2009-02-15 17:15:00;15 seconds;Small Sphere traveled very low, very smoothly, and then danced out of sight. I was walking in the area of Union Station when a small greyish-white Sphere came in to view very close to me.  It was traveling at about 10 miles per hour approximately 20-30 feet off the ground.  It was moving so smoothly in one direction (diagonal, to my left, passing from the side of me to in front of me) that at first i thought this sphere was on some type of invisible zip-line.  Then the sphere started moving in directions outside of it's original path.  Still traveling forward, it moved up and down, and then swooped very quickly as it got closer to the brick building in front of me (High School in the Community).  The sphere was small as I mentioned, but it's movements were quick and smooth.  The possibility of it being controlled somehow by remote is out of the question based on the quick, sudden movements (at one point doing a quick loop.  The word dancing would almost describe it).  I kept walking forward towards the brick building where it was fading out of my site, and then I could no longer see it as it seemed to have traveled out of site.  I continued to look for it for the next 30 minutes to no avail.  Shortly thereafter I saw a large slowly drifting  object far off in the distance, cigar shaped, but very large.  It didn't act or look like a cloud.  The only possibility I could come up with was that maybe it was a Zeppelin or blimp.  This remained in my sight for 15 minutes or so.  Also, a bright light high in the sky appeared in view.  It looked like a bright star or planet, but I hadn't seen it minutes earlier.  This made it suspicious to me.  I asked another walker on the streets if he could see it and he could.  He said maybe it was Venus.  Regardless, the sphere was very much so real, and blew my mind.;41.316090551181;-72.9269877952756

I reached for my phone as it disappeared behind the tree thinking that it would come out from behind the tree but it never emerged.;41.316090551181;-72.9269877952756
