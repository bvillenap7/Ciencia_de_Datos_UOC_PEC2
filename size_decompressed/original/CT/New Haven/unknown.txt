Silent object cut through clouds at a very rapid pace.;2020-11-05 18:27:00;15 seconds;Silent object cut through clouds at a very rapid pace. While unloading groceries from my trunk I looked up and noticed that something was cutting through the clouds at a rather fast pace.  The object was completely silent and appeared to be moving at a speed greater than what a traditional aircraft would.   I was unable to see the craft but the clouds were being cut, forming a boomerang shape at the front of where the craft had to be. Once the craft cut through, it left a clear gap where it had gone through.  The craft did not have lights consistent with a traditional aircraft - no flashing lights or bright lights whatsoever but it did assist to have a faint red tint as it cut through the clouds certainly not bright enough to be from a plane.  Also, unlike a plane,  the craft was no longer visible after cutting through the clouds.   I would have expected to see it once it moved out of the clouds and into the clear sky but I didn't.;41.316090551181;-72.9269877952756
