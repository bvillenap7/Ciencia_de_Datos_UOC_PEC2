Bright light with a consistent vertical then horizontal movement and then stops and starts all over again.;2005-03-16 20:00:00;Constant;Bright light with a consistent vertical then horizontal movement and then stops and starts all over again. I have been observing this for a couple of years. At first I thought it was probably a star. It is in the same place every night. It has a distinct vertical movement then a distinct horizontal movement and then stays still and starts all over again. It most probably is circular but the most outstanding feature is that it is very bright. It may be a satellite also. It would be nice if someone could observe this and let me know what it might be. Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD));41.5798;-72.5004
