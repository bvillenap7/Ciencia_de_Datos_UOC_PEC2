Strange hovering lights over Orange/Derby CT;2005-09-19 21:00:00;2 mins;Strange hovering lights over Orange/Derby CT While driving on RT 34 from Orange CT to Derby my girlfriend and I notice what appeared to be a low flying plane over the tree line. The craft was over a residential area just on the border of a farm/Field. I notice that the plan must have been coming directly toward us since it did not appear to be moving. As we got closer to the object I told my girlfriend that it was not moving...She laughed and a moment later said Oh my God, it's not moving. I started to get closer and closer to the object. At my closest point I was across the street slowed down to about 15 mph. The craft seemed to be maybe 500 to 1000 feet over the tree line. It was hard to tell since it was dark, and since I could not see the body of the craft I had no frame of reference. As we got closer to the craft I put my window down and was amazed that I didn't hear a sound for such a low flying object. The craft appeared to be just staying in place. It was three lights directly across from one anther and what possible appeared to be a faint light in the back forming a T. The back light was so dim I'm not sure I even saw it. Now to me this seems to be the standard shape of a plane. Under any normal situation I would pass it off as such, but the lack of movement almost made it eerie. Since it is a busy street I had to keep moving. I got to the next light less than a quarter mile and way and did a U-Turn. When I got back to the area there was nothing. This was a strange event but at the same time very exciting. I'm a big time skeptic but this I had trouble explaining. I was hoping I was not the only one that saw it...I will check the local paper in the morning to see if there is any news on the event.;41.2803;-73.0295
