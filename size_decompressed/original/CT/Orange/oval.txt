It was a massive craft, oblong and oval in shape, bigger than a blimp.  It made a huge constant loud rumbling noise as it passed by slowly.   The lights were amazing.  A white and green dot on top with a long streak of lights along what looked to be the bottom or side.  The long streak had to be close to 100 yards in length and the streaks changed color periodically from white to red and to blue.  I did capture on video, the craft with the noise over our house, but the video does not do it justice.  Also as the craft moved overhead, every sensor light we have around our house went off an continued to for about 1/2 hour afterwards;41.2803;-73.0295
