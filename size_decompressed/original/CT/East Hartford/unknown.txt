the neighborhood lights up brighter than the day time for a split second;1998-08-23 05:00:00;5 minutes;the neighborhood lights up brighter than the day time for a split second My observation is unique my brother woke me up after coming home and while laying in bed I looked out the window from the side of the blinds. I observed a white lit object to my 10 o'clock about two blocks vertically and horizonally away and couldn't make out a shape. It stayed in position so I figured a helicopter at first but there was no blinking lights. I remembered from Unsolved Mysteries someone used thier mind to communicate with an unknown being in the woods so I gave it a try.Hello with my mind and to my amazement it turned bright purple. I wasn't afraid so next I tried this with my mind can I go for a ride and check out your home I received no communication back please intervene with our government their out of touch and let me be in control or be prime minister between our species no message received back to me.  Move side to side it moved side to side up and down it moved up and down  do figure eights it moved in figure eights at this point I wanted to go outside but was afraid of getting burned.                                                                                       Next, I wanted to see its power so I used my mind to communicate fly over my house as fast as you can while thinking of the direction it should take from the back to front of my house. It disappears in front of my eyes and seconds later it goes over my house from my 6 o'clock to 12 o'clock in a split second the neighborhood lights up brighter than day time for that split second while a streched boomerrang shape don't remember if it was still purple, goes towards Hartford from the speed. It was so close to my roof I heard a whamp sound which was heard after it passed over and felt like the roof was about to be torn off from the house cause of this objects energy. I told myself this was the coolest thing that ever happened to me and laid in bed just thinking about what just happened. Ten minutes later the sun started coming up and went to the porch to have a smoke and my brother ! who seen nothing was there for the past minute.
