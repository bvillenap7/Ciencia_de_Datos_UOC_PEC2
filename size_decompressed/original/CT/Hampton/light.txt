I take the dogs out pretty late every night so they don't wake me up early.  My wife and I like to look up at the stars because we live drop in the woods with very little light sources to ruin the view.  I noticed one light when my wife noticed another.  We both followed the light until we realized they were headed toward each other.  A third came into view as they got closer together.  They converged abs formed a triangle for a few seconds before taking off in different directions than they came.  I told my wife pick one and watch it while I watched another.  She lost hers behind the trees.  Mine flew over the house towards the front.  I followed it until it was out of sight.  Then, right where the light went out of sight an extremely bright blue light appeared from nowhere and moved at an incredible speed from left to right in my field of vision.  My wife was standing right next to me and saw it as well.  We both stood there for many moments astonished at what we had witnessed.  I was in the military for eight years and have knowledge of aircraft.  This was nothing that I've ever seen before.  Now we watch the sky above our house as much as possible.;41.7672;-72.0651
