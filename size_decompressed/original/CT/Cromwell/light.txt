It turned end over end and then zigzagged. There were white and blue blinking lights around it and it was like watching an old wooden Water Wheel in the Sky but one with lights on the spokes. I followed it, it was ahead of me over 691 and then it zigzagged and I took the exit to get on 91N to follow it some more. I saw it go over the mt on my right a few exits before exit 19 on 91N.;41.6117;-72.6652
blueish green ball of light fly in the sky below the clouds in a curved and crooked direction;2008-06-24 23:36:00;5 - 10 seconds;blueish green ball of light fly in the sky below the clouds in a curved and crooked direction I was in a parking lot with my friend sitting in a car waiting for someone. My friend and I were talking about UFOs and he mentioned how he was listening to a radio station where a guy was talking about how he saw a UFO in the sky and the person on the radio described it as if you were to hold up your thumbnail to the sky that’s how big it was. So, my friend and I put our thumbs up to compare how big this thing was that the radio person saw.  Immediately after we put our thumbs in the air, we see a ball of light zip through the sky for a few seconds. The light was of a blue or green tint. It flew below the clouds very fast and was not a plane. The light did not move in a straight motion either, it went straight, then bumped to the left and curved, then continued to go straight. We concluded that it couldn’t have been a shooting star or anything of that matter because it did not move in a straight line.;41.6117;-72.6652
White light Southeast of Cromwell, CT;2011-08-17 16:00:00;10 minutes;White light Southeast of Cromwell, CT The white light was spotted at a far distance in the Southeast sky, towards the direction of Portland.   The light hovered for approximately 10 minutes, than proceeding in an eastward direction slowly than disappeared out of sight.  There were 6 witnesses and we all agreed that it was much too high in the sky to be a helicopter or a plane and to far out to be a metallic balloon.

3 fast moving lights;2011-08-17 21:30:00;15 min;3 fast moving lights Watched a small light traveling fast across sky from south to north. Quickly changed direction then again and continued on previous path. It then appeared to get brighter very quickly as if it got closer and then inversely. As we remarked about what we had just saw a similar light travelled north to south at relatively same speed. Less then a minute from that light disappearing from view we saw another light same shape size and speed as other two.   This time it reacted as the first light and appeared to get brighter as if closer then dimmer as if farther and continue upon its course.  These lights were far away for the most part and very small looking and traveling at a rapid speed. Amazing what ever it was.

It was moving extremely fast above me to the right.  It appeared round or saucer shaped with four lights and one red.  No plane I have ever seen.;41.6117;-72.6652
I thought it was a star off to the E, but the blinking lights jumped out.  It sat there for hrs.  Green, blue, red.;2016-10-11 02:30:00;2 hours;At first I thought it was a star off to the East but the blinking lights jumped out.  It sat there for hours.  Green, blue, hints of red lights, almost strobing in the distance.  It caught both me and my wife off guard.  Whatever it is, it's not a plane or a star.  That much is known to my wife and me.
