Pulsating light in the northeast skies of Cromwell, CT;2013-07-04 14:30:00;10 minutes;Pulsating light in the northeast skies of Cromwell, CT Six of us witnessed a pulsating light located in the northeast sky, in the direction of Glastonbury, CT.   We couldn't make out the exact shape of the UFO but it looked to be diamond shaped.  Based on the distance, we estimated the object to be at least 30,000+ feet high.  We witnessed the stationary object for over 10 minutes and then a cloud came by which disrupted our view and by the time the cloud  cleared our line of sight,  the object was gone.   At first we thought it was a plane moving away from us as this object was located in the direction of a flight pattern.  However after the event, we tracked planes flying by and nothing could even come close to what we saw.   Proof positive of the experience was that the skeptics present could note explain it either!
