My husband called me out after observing three of them.  I observed three lights in the distance, appearing stationary, but likely moving away from our position.   Eventually, you couldnâ€™t see them anymore.  Then single objects began to come by, one at a time.  Moving in a straight line from South to North (approximately).  By the eye, they appeared to be small fireballs.  They did not have a tail and there was no sound.   Using a camera and 4x zoom, the lights on the objects made them appear cylindrical in shape.  Lights flashed between yellow and red.    The objects get smaller as they move away and eventually move behind the clouds.  Simultaneously with one object, an airplane flew by.  There were three distinct lights on the airplane and one could hear the engine as it flew by.  Both my husband and I are well educated, middle-aged people.;41.6117;-72.6652
