Five Orange Fireballs over Cromwell, Ct.;2012-12-31 22:00:00;5 minutes;Five Orange Fireballs over Cromwell, Ct My wife and I were heading home from dinner and when we pulled onto our street, we saw four orange lights, almost like fireballs in the sky.  We noticed them moving slowly in a northwest direction approximately 800-1000 feet high.   We ended up pulling over and I shot video with my phone however based on the distance of the objects, the quality isn't that good.  As we were shooting the video, we noticed that one by one that seemed to turn blue in color then completely disappear.   When we got home, I took our dog out and looked up into the sky and one was directly over our house, approximately 500 feet high.   Although I was able to see it clearly, I still can't explain what it was.   I know we saw was something extraordinary because my wife is a huge skeptic regarding this type of stuff and she couldn't offer a logical explanation.

Two Large Fireballs witnessed in Cromwell, CT.;2014-07-10 21:00:00;10 seconds;Two Large Fireballs witnessed in Cromwell, CT Approximately at 9PM EST, I looked out the window and saw to large fireballs in the southeast sky.  The sighting only lasted about 10 seconds.  They both faded out.  I wasn't able to judge the two fireballs altitude but distance from us was plus or minus two miles.   This is my fourth sighting since 2008 and the 3rd time I've seen fireballs within two years.  I used the Skyview Free app to get an idea of location in the sky.   It was just left of Sagittarius.   Whatever these are it is amazing every time.   My wife also witnessed this event in addition to the others.
