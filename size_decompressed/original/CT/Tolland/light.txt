2 red blinking orbs.;2010-05-20 21:30:00;10 sec;2 red blinking orbs. 2 red blinking orbs flying at a steady high speed approximetly 1 mile appart from each other. They where completly silent and I could not tell the shape of the objects. One of them stoped blinking completly for about 4 seconds,then started blinking again.  About 10-12 seconds after these objects dissapeared from my view i could hear the sounds of a loud jet but could not locate it. These objects appeared to be exactly the same as one another and where deffinetly not conventional aircraft.

A large bright white light with spikes of light shooting out and then retracting .;2012-09-10 03:00:00;at least 3 hours;A large bright white light with spikes of light shooting out and then retracting . A large bright white light with spikes of light shooting out and then retracting has been appearing nightly for over a month. We assumed it was a star or planet.  Last night we watched it move to the right faster than a star would move.  Then it moved back to the original position. Then it moved towards us and then it moved far away backwards at speed even planes cannot move. Then back towards us.  Then it stopped moving. We have no idea what it is now, but someone should look at it and explain it.  Our elevation is 700 ft., +41° 50' 24.26&quot, -72° 22' 31.59&quot (41.840073, -72.375441), and we have a large view of the sky. It looked like there were briefly some blue rays of light at one point but I am not sure of that.I am sure there is a good explanation, it would be really nice to know since I see it through my window while I'm in bed. I did take photos of it with my Iphone.when you enlarge photo two other lights appear next to it one on each side.;41.8663;-72.3744
Motionless orange light in the sky, moved quickly away as we approached;2017-03-17 00:45:00;10 minutes;Motionless Orange light in the sky, moved quickly away as we approached. Prior to March 17, 2017, I treated UFO reports as simply more sensationalist seeking hogwash.  I still don’t know what the object  was, can’t even explicitly define it as a UFO, but what I and my wife saw that night while driving in Tolland, CT, 12:45 AM was very strange. Orange light motionless in the sky. We watched it for a while as we tried to determine if it was a planet or an airplane heading to Bradley airport. We dismissed the plane theory because it was not moving. Dismissed the planet theory because it was too big. At one point my wife said it’s a house on top of the mountain, to which I responded there is no mountain in Connecticut that high.  I made a left turn to go up a hill to get a better look. As the car rounded the corner at the top of the hill we saw the orange glow like a huge sodium lamp in the sky. I stopped the car and that’s when the bizarre behavior began.  The previously stationary light moved quickly to the right, faster than a helicopter or any other aircraft, but slower than a meteorite, made sweeping left turn and disappeared behind the trees.  There was no sound, I had opened the car window. I took a picture of my location with my cell phone but when I checked the picture, the GPS coordinates were not recorded.  Weird and frightening.  My wife can verify.  We were not drinking, neither of us do drugs, and we were not dreaming.;41.8663;-72.3744
