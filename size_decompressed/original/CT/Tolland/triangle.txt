It also was the size of a football field, the thing was huge and silent.  Just glided silently.  Just as I was about to tell others about the sight, the tail lights (along the back edge) turned off.  And it blocked out the night sky.  This is not the only sighting I have seen. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));41.8663;-72.3744
