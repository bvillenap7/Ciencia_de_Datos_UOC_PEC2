Egg shaped object flying over Tolland to then disappear.;2018-04-22 23:50:00;15 seconds;Egg shaped object flying over Tolland to then disappear. On the night of april 22, 2018, my girlfriend, my friend ((male name deleted)), and I, were pulling out of my driveway to bring my girlfriend home when a large oval/egg shaped object that was a white with a green kind of glow to it flew passed my vehicle, and then after about 10 to 15 seconds, it’s like the lights went out and it was gone with no track of it moving in a different direction or altitude.   As we got to the top of my street, which peaks the top of a mountain, we looked around all directions and it was nowhere to be found.  Thinking it was just a plane, but if it was, we could easily still see it from the peak of the hill.   At that point we all couldn’t believe what we saw, but we know for sure by the way it was flying and how it just disappeared it was not something of this planet. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and we found him to be eloquent, and serious-minded.  PD));41.8663;-72.3744
