Strange object in the sky following a plane.;2012-10-16 18:20:00;1 minute;Strange object in the sky following a plane. Around 6:20pm on Tuesday October 16, 2012.  I was walking through this truck yard in Tolland CT.  When I noticed this plane flying real low towards me in a SE direction.  After seeing this plane flying towards me I noticed this other object move towards south direction it then stopped dead in the air.  Thatâ€™s when I pulled out my iphone and started recording this video http: //youtu.be/nyV_-5Y42qg.   Right after I started recording this it was as if the plane had noticed it and took a hard right. When the plane made that turn that object started to follow behind it till it caught up to it.  Then the object proceeded to fly circles around it as if it was curious of what the plan was.  After a couple of circles around the plan the object flew off at a very high rate of speed.  When I was in the yard I was facing North NW, the plane was flying straight towards me and the object that was in the sky chased it was coming from  the south.;41.8663;-72.3744
