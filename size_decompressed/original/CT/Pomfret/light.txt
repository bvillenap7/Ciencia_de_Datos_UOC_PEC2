They appeared to be low...maybe 10,000 feet or so and all were absolutely silent.  It was a quiet night..very still..no wind and any plane engine would have been easily heard.  They all traveled at the same speed and slowly.  There were no clouds in the sky..visibility was excellent.  I watched them go from horizon to horizon.;41.8909;-71.9634
