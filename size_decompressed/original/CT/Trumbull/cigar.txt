Lights on a strange cigar object.;2012-07-09 22:35:00;3-4 minutes;Lights on a strange cigar object. Hello Mr. Davenport. I know of your work and other Ufologists, I have seen you and others on TV.   My sighting tonight was something that seemed so strange, I feel like I should share it with others and an expert in Ufology like yourself for I never have seen a UFO sighting.  This evening I was outside with a neighbor whittling wood for this is a hobby of ours and many like us.  I looked over to see my friend in a awe looking in the sky.  I was startled by his facial expression, it was as if he looking on the the destruction of Gomorrah.  I looked in the direction in the sky my friend was looking and there at the crest of the hill a cigar shaped craft, with strange holes (circle windows maybe, or lights?).  It was a few hundred yards in the air to my best guess, and about a half a mile away.  I turn my to see my neighbor was gone, he was sprinting to his home yelling to me he wanted to get his camera phone. I watched the craft as it descended further away and higher! in the sky.  Two minutes or so had passed my neighbor returned to only find that the craft disappeared to the heavens.   I want to share this experience I had with people who will understand and not look upon me as a leper.  Lets face it the government wants us to adopt the idea that UFOs are fiction. We have been ravaged my lies and immorality.  Our government needs to understand that we the people know that UFOs are controlled by intelligent beings like us are more superior.  This craft that I saw was far more advanced than anything I have ever seen or read about.   Thank you Mr. Davenport for your work in Ufology, and thank you for your time.
