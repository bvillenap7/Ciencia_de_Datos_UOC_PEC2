Brown rolling cylinder w/o sound nor light that seemed to have paddle-wings or changed shape as it proceed.;2004-07-08 20:00:00;40 seconds;Brown rolling cylinder w/o sound nor light that seemed to have paddle-wings or changed shape as it proceed. The backgound - a clear evening, sun just setting. Object seen directly overhead. Traveling in straight line. Speed seemed paced as if musing. Brown, cylindrical shape no lights or obvious features, except it seemed very large, larger than normal aircraft. Altitude apprx. 800 ft. Viewed at first as an aircraft in a barrel-roll, because it spun as a stunt pilot would. As the object proceeded, the view was no longer overhead but from behind, as it left almost straight away. The observation from here presented wonder for how long a pilot could continue such roll, as it was continuous and without falter from its course. Then when far enough away the observation was astonishing. The view of a rolling plane from behind would show its wings on end, becoming mere lines to the eye's perspective, yet this view showed a continuous and slow roll with large flat oval-shaped wings very visible from behind, [or the object was shifting in form from round to oval and back, which is where the mind and the eyes refused to agree.] Not until after it went beyond the tree line did observer realize that it was not a conventional aircraft.;41.2573000000002;-73.2111999999998
