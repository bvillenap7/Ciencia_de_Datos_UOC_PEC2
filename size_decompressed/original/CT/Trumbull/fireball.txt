Green Fireball Sighted;2011-10-20 21:30:00;2-3 seconds;Green Fireball Sighted October 20, 2011 9:30-10:00 P.M. Trumbull, CT. From my viewpoint near the west end of Whitney Ave. Trumbull I saw a greenish fireball traverse low in the sky traveling west.  It appeared higher than treetop level against the sky and it lasted 2 to 3 seconds.  I am not sure if this was some sort of pyrotechnic or really something more astral in nature.  There was no sounds  Just wondering if there were additional sightings.;41.2573000000002;-73.2111999999998
