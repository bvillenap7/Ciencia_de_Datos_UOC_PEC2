Grid of lights moving slowly out of formation..;2013-03-24 00:00:00;3 minutes;Grid of lights moving slowly out of formation At Approximately 12:05am March 24th I was traveling southbound on Route 25 in CT. While looking in the easterly direction I saw what appeared to be 11-12 red lights in the sky.  They were patterned in floating grid 3 across and 4 down somewhat equally spaced.  The lights were moving slowly towards one another and floating in what looked to be an intended pattern.  Originally it looked as though they were forming a constellation, but they never seemed to form one for indefinite period of time. I pulled over to take a video and slowly they began to disappear. Whether they merged into fewer lights, I am not sure but it did happen before I turned away with a couple of the lights. When I finally got to a point where a video was possible there was only one light left.;41.2573000000002;-73.2111999999998
