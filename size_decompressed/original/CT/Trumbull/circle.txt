While driving in the car I witnessed a circular shaped craft the color was grayish silver. It looked like it had energy moving through it. I had only looked at it for about half a minute then it started moving really quick and was going in one direction and then I thought it had changed and shifted in another and was one really fast.;41.2573000000002;-73.2111999999998

It was really high no planes fly that high plus it was stationary when I 1st witnessed it. I never witnessed something so amazing. Soon after towards the left of me I see a shooting star fly across the opposite side which I thought was crazy since I looked up to see if I would see 1 out of the blue and bam there that was. I don't know what else it could be but a UFO. Really cool to see. Bright and lite up all around. White light;41.2573000000002;-73.2111999999998
