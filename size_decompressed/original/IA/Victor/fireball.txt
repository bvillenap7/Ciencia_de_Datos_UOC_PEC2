Object sped over me to about 45 degrees towards the east. Then the object performed a perfect right angle turn to the south and sped out of sight. At around 10:20 p.m. April 22, 2000, I was outside my home looking at the stars. It was mostly overcast, but I could see some stars. As I was looking at the Big Dipper constellation, I noticed a light streaking overhead. This object was bright enough to shine through the cloud cover. In less then 10 seconds the object flew over my head to about 45 degrees in the east, then performed a perferct right angle turn to the south. This object was a round fireball, bright red in color. The speed of this thing was incredible, making me believe it was a meteor. I would still believe this if I had not seen the right angle turn. I am a 31 year old factory worker.;41.727;-92.2794
