I was 20' from craft, the engines started up with an intense wind coming from craft--about 100 MPH wind.  Pinned me against my pickup truck, as it shot straight up faster than a rifle bullt and disapeared! My wife and I built an underground house, sucluded in a wooded area. A pond laid right beside it. One night as we arrived home around midnight, I was crossing the pond levee(which was my driveway) Immediatley the pond and hillsides were light up like the middle of the afternoon.  Then I stopped the truck and got out looked above the pond about 10' and witnessed a 12' circular light on the bottom of some sort of craft.  There was no noise heard, I then yelled at them to come on down and they'd be safe. The craft stayed until my pregnant wife with my young son ran for the house. When my wife disapeared around the house, the crafts engine started and almost blew me down.  The wind was at least 100 MPH. It shot straight up until it was out of sight, faster than a rifle bullet! I believe that the craft seemed to be taking up water into it. Shortly after this incident my infant daughter was born and developed an virus that needed medical attention, and the doctor ask my wife if she had been to South America.  Because there was no cases of that type of illness in the U.S. We believe the craft may of had something to do with this illness.  The next day from viewing the craft there was a 12'  diameter circle mashed into the weeds where it must of landed. That was my first and last sighting, it has changed my way of thinking forever. It was definetly something from another planet, with way more technology then we have today.;41.1011;-91.262
