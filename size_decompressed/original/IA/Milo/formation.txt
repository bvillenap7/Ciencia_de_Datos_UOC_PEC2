Orange lights in triangle formation;2019-12-20 18:50:00;18:53;Orange lights in triangle formation My wife and I were driving home from dinner last night and saw orange lights in the sky.  There were three lights in a triangular formation flying NNE at typical small aircraft speed.  The formation did not change as the lights moved across the sky.  Once the three were out of sight or turned east and lights were not visible, three more flew along the same flight path one at a time and disappeared at roughly the same point.  There was no noticeable sound associated with the fly over.;41.2894;-93.4456
