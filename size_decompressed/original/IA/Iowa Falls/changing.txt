I was twenty minutes eastbound, out of Iowa Falls, along U.S. Route 20, when I discovered that I had an escort, or something like that. It was right around 4 AM, when I noticed, from the driver’s seat, off to my left, that a circular object, a disk, or a lopsided orb, a blob, which was illuminated white on top, and lime green on the underside, with a row of flashing colored lights in the middle, was pacing my vehicle, a semi truck hauling a refer trailer, a load of Covid vaccine destined for Cedar Falls.  My first impression was that this was some kind of highway patrol drone, so I slowed to the limit. After a minute, it dawned on me that this was something even stranger. My “escort” flew 30’ off the left side of the vehicle, and maintained a position that looked like it was 20’ ahead of the truck, and about 15’ above the cab. This thing, it was, well it had to be at least 12’ in diameter, and the light source appeared to be coming from within the interior... in other words, it glowed. You could say that it had an aura, and there were moments, as the thing preceded the truck, when the aura changed shape, and appeared to surge ahead of the object.  Not sure what I was dealing with, I got on the radio and told the security car, which had probably driven a mile ahead of me, to haul ass back to my position. I think I shook him up, because he was all excited, and told me that he’d have to take the next exit and double back to me.  After another three or four minutes, the blob accelerated, speeding into the night ahead of me, toward the eastern horizon and Cedar Falls.;42.516;-93.2712
