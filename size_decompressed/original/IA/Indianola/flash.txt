Bright flashing light zooming toward earth.  ((anonymous report));2019-01-21 04:15:00;5 seconds;Bright flashing light zooming toward earth. While driving North on R63 towards Des Moines, both passengers saw a flash of a bright light on the horizon.  At first it looked like an airplane, with white and red blinking lights, but then it seemed to shoot like a falling star and terminate in a burst of bright light.  We saw this in the dark NE horizon, in the rural countryside before Fleur Drive. We tried to explain it away by saying it was a falling star exploding in the earth's atmosphere, but both witnesses agreed that it was strange that the star seemed to hover for a moment like an airplane or aircraft, and then shoot with impossible speed to the ground. One of the witnesses did not believe in UFOs before this event.  Now they shrug and say maybe. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

However, the light was green, seemed to be flying at a planned projectory, and it was too close and too bright to the trees to be a meteorite.  It could have been in a V shape, it was too quick to tell.  I wondered if it could be a drone, but there was really no one awake in the neighborhood to be flying a drone, and it was too fast.;41.3143;-93.5880000000001
