Orange-Copper Glowing Diamonds...;1998-06-30 02:00:00;1-2 MINUTES;Orange-Copper Glowing Diamonds... I was driving along Route R63 Hiway about 2:00 a.m in the summer of 1998.  I'm not sure of the exact date...   I was coming up over a hill and noticed a orange-colored object that was moving accross the horizon west to east.  As I approached the object, it moved closer and closer to the road.  At first, I disregarded the object as a helicopter, but when I got close enought to see it, I realized that it was not.    The object appeared to be two 3-Demensional Diamonds that were attached side by side.  The object was small, no bigger than a refrigerator, and it glowed a strange orange-copper like color.   The object stopped about 100-200 feet from the road and it floated about 50 feet in the air.  When it stopped next to the road, it did not move at all nor did it make any noise.  I was tempted to stop for a better look, but quite frankly, I was too frightened to do so.  In fact, I pushed my car to its limits to get away from it the object did not follow.
