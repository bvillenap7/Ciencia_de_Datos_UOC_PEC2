Craft sucking water from pond.;1980-06-15 10:30:00;10min.;Craft sucking water from pond. We arrived home late.  Our home was a under-ground home. Rural area down in a grove of trees. Our lane went across the levie to our home. We had no yard light.  We were driving in a pick-up truck down hill on our lane. We looked ahead and the pond was iluminated with brite light. We were confused because we had no yard light. We stopped the truck on the levie. I immediatly got out.  I was standing with my back against the truck, door. I looked up into a perfectly circular light.   Approximatly 20 feet in diameter. About 10 ft. high over the pond. Approximatly 25ft. from me. It was a craft hovering motionless. With no sound. I immediatly started talking to the craft.  I said, Don't be scart of me, come down and give me a ride.   As I was talking my wife was running to the house with our son. I heard the engine fire up. Wind started blowing from the craft stronger and stronger. I was pinned to the side of my truck. Could not move, the craft shot straight up 20 times faster then a  high powered rifle bullet. It was a roar that I have never heard before.  In 5 seconds the light completely disapeared.  The next day, I was looking around the house and found a 12ft. diameter circle of flattened weeds. I never reported this to anyone. I didn't think anyone would believe me.;41.206;-91.1692
