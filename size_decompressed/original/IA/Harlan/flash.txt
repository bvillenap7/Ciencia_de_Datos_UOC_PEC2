Blue flashes/orbs/dancing lights.  ((anonymous report));2018-09-18 03:08:00;1 hour;Blue flashes/orbs/dancing lights Series of 5 soft electric blue flashes in northern sky over 1 hr duration.  I deliberately set alarm to awake in the early morning to watch the sky away from the city. Lots of pulsating ‘stars’ and odd pattern movement by orbs/lights.  (Obvious human aircraft with blinking lights were out circling the skies probably researching the orbs and flashes) I heard jets too.    *There was similar activity in the early morning skies the day before as well, but no airplanes or jets were out.  I watched the sky for hours both nights and seen dozens of zig- zagging orbs, but these flashes were new & uncommon to an avid sky watcher. *Also- owls, geese, locusts & crickets didn’t portray any unusual behavior during my witnessing.
