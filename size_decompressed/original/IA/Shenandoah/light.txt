I was taking the garbage out on Thanksgiving night and noticed how bright the moon was, then noticed a few stars.  As I started to return to the house I looked up for stars and saw two directly overhead.  As I watched them it became obvious they were moving in unison in a straight line from N.W. to the S.E.  I called to my wife, she came out and witnessed them also.  The lead light was much brighter than the one trailing.  It was hard to judge the altitude and the distance between the two objects, and too dark to see if anything was connecting them.  The sighting lasted about two minutes.  I took a video of them but after reviewing it decided the quality was too poor to upload to any web pages. The lights never wavered from moving in a straight line.  They didn't make a sound either.;40.7527;-95.3579
