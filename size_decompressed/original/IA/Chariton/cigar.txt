I witnessed an event, myself, two moving lights, becoming three, moving from the west heading southeast. It was at 5:21 am 10/8/2014, I was outside my second floor apartment on the flat roof in back of the building. The event lasted 7-8 seconds.  I had been awake since 4 am.  I was watching the eclipse. It was dark out. The two lights were white-ish blue-ish, moving fast from my right to my left, above the rooftop of the building south of mine.  I thought it was strange, so since I had my binoculars (eclipse) I put them to my eyes and what I saw was like nothing else.  I first noticed there were now three lights, in between and in the back of a cigar shaped object. It was moving fast and quiet.  That lasted only two seconds, then it was gone. As I lowered my binoculars it was out of sight.;41.0248;-93.3132
