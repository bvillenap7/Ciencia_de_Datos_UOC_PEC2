Line of 30-40 white lights moving single file through the sky from NW to SE;2020-04-27 21:15:00;3 minutes;Line of 30-40 white lights moving single file through the sky from NW to SE Looking to the SE we could see a line of white lights, moving across the night sky in single file in a very straight line.  They were moving from the NW to the SE.  When we first saw them I started counting and got up to 28, but there were more coming and we had missed some of them.  There was no sound and they were about the brightness of a very bright star.  They seemed to be in linear groups of 2 and 3.  Observers were a science teacher and a science professional with advanced degrees.;41.0248;-93.3132
