Much brighter than any star, or planet, silent. White bright light, at slow to mid ranging velocities in the eastern horizon.  When filmed with digital camera, an entire color spectrum appeared to display from the object, in a strobe sequence, which none of us could see with the naked eye. Later the object stopped all movement, and 5-10 minutes of still hovering occurred, followed by a falling star, and the appearance of other distant objects.  When studied these two new craft displayed not only a color sweep of red, green, white, and blue, but also formed a perfect triangle shape with the original object, almost as if creating the first object of notice, as some sort of elaborate light show..?   In the distance to the southeast, a jet aircraft with standard blinking white, red, and blue lights was visible. Moving from the west to a south-southeastern heading.~~  ~~~   Object observed by 3 young adults, after a event.;42.040805882353;-93.6229039215687
