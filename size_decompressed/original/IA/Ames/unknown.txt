My aunt and I were looking at Venus, when suddenly my aunt saw a red,blue,and white flashing object appear from nowhere.It seemed to have come from Venus.It also seemed like it was conjoined with a second object just like it.The object went North then did a zig-zagged pattern from North to South.It then headed North again.Trees were blocking our view so i went to the East where the object kept moving North.As i was watching my aunt saw a second object come from Venus again.It looked the same.It took the same direction as the first one.Since the trees were again blocking our view,we moved East.The first object descended somewhere to the North of us while the second one headed West and descended also.There was no vapor or jet stream from either objects.The objects made no sound.The sky was free of clouds.We do have a airport,but it is to the South of us.Also the towns to the North and West of us are rather small and do not have a airport.We are not sure how far it was from us,but we think it both objects landed either in town or the outskirts of town.One of my aunt's friends saw  a disk shaped craft 6/16/04.He lives in Ames also.;42.040805882353;-93.6229039215687

But as I headed home I noticed a weird light emitting from an object I thought was a flipped car,  as I kept driving trying to decide if I should go back and see what it was, I saw that the light still was bright and shining at me as if it was pointing light in all description.  So me being curious turned around to check it out, as I did I video taped it to send it to my friend I was hanging out with, joking about seeing as a ufo, but as I was taking the video, I slowed down and realized to my horror it really was moving like a ufo, and as I was stopped there, it started moving towards me and I started going again, on the video you can see that my view was lost momentarily behind a barn, as I gained sight again it was moving somehow instantly much closer to me . Going at the same speed as me! parallel and behind me a little bit. I have video here, I have no idea what to do this is a super scary experience;42.040805882353;-93.6229039215687
