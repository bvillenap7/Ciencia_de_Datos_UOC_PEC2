Large triangular craft travels slowly at low altitude over Ames, IA;2001-05-17 21:45:00;3-4 minutes;Large triangular craft travels slowly at low altitude over Ames, IA At 9:45 PM, a large trangular pattern of blinking lights was observed at low altitude. The object, estimated at less than 5,000 feet in altitude, was 3-4 times the diameter of the full moon.  Binoculars used by 2 adult witnesses could not view the entire object as it slowly traveled west to east following a course along the Lincoln Highway (old 30) through Ames.  Object was totally silent, and viewed by 2 adults and 3 children.  MUFON investigators Bev Trout and John Patterson took full report on 5-21-01. ((NUFORC Note:  Please see full report submitted by Beverly Trout, State Director, Iowa, Mutual UFO Network.  Witness is holds a senior academic position in a technical field.

Credible witnesses, using binoculars, checking details of huge, nearby object.;2001-05-17 21:45:00;3 Minutes;Credible witnesses, using binoculars, checking details of huge, nearby object. This report is from Bev Trout, Iowa MUFON State Director, E-Mail address is: btufo@netins.net and she would welcome questions, comments, etc. about the following report:  PhD at Iowa State University,his wife, and three children witnessed this sighting of a huge, silent triangle, with bright white lights blinking/strobing/pulsing, first seen at about 50-55 degrees up from western horizon, last seen about 30 degrees up from eastern horizon, with traverse time of 3 minutes at 23:45 (9:45 p.m. Central Daylight Time) on May 17th.  5 minutes later witnesses called Iowa MUFON State Director.  Subsequent investigaton shows cloud ceiling at 9,000 ft. with family estimating altitude of 5,000 feet, with closest approach 85 degrees almost overhead.  Viewed through binoculars by husband and wife, with 378 feet linear diameter field of view @1,000 yards(translating into approx. 7 degrees angular field).  Binocular field of view could not contain the entire triangular object.  That is, husband and wife could NOT see the entire object within the field of view of their binoculars.  Obviously, these witness estimates cannot pinpoint the exact altitude, dimensions, etc. of this object, BUT these are credible witnesses who are able to question their own perceptions.  Investigators on this case, having checked law enforcement, Iowa state climatologist, and FAA, are convinced that whatever was seen was, indeed, HUGE, and since we cannot easily explain it, it remains in the UFO category. ADDED TO INVESTIGATORS' INTEREST IN THE AMES AREA, are reports of a neighbor to the above family having seen an unexplained aerial object BETWEEN/BESIDE their adjacent homes on a previous occasion. ALSO, the wife witness in the above case had a daytime sighting three years ago near the southwestern part of Ames (this is town of permanent population of around 30,000....student population at Iowa State University obviously swells the population considerably) PLUS, we have been contacted with abduction reports by several individuals in the Ames area - all witnesses thus far check out as highly educated, credible individuals with (as far as we can tell) their psychological feet on the ground, i.e. not wanting to over-conclude, but realizing that they've been able to remain conscious at least part of the time during encounters involving UFOs. IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT - only 7 miles from Ames in 1996, two crop formations were discovered, with plant and soil samples subsequently being submitted to Dr. W. C. Levengood's non-profit laboratory in Michigan, with lab results clearly showing anomalies associated with the formations. AS AN INVESTIGATOR, I NOTE THAT someone else from the Ames, Iowa area turned in a report to NUFORC recently, without leaving their name so that they could be contacted by MUFON investigators.  I would like any individuals who are reluctant to report to us to know that MUFON DOES NOT REVEAL WITNESS IDENTITY, unless that witness is willing to be revealed publicly.  We have NO WISH TO EXPLOIT ANYONE!) ((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to Bev Trout for submitting the report.  We encourage any other wintesses to the event to contact her directly.  In addition, we would invite other witnesses to submit brief reports to NUFORC, using our Online Report Form.  Thank you.  PD));42.040805882353;-93.6229039215687
A very big triangle of 20 - 30 green spots;2001-06-21 22:30:00;6 mn;A very big triangle of 20 - 30 green spots A very big triangle composed of  20 or 30 green spots. It travels slowly over the clouds. The green lights were very bright and pure color. We saw it when it was at zenithal position, and it goes from west to east not far from a highway. The event duration was 5 - 6 minutes in a totaly silence.;42.040805882353;-93.6229039215687
Orange Triangular Craft in Pursuit;2007-07-07 00:45:00;5 Minutes +;Orange Triangular Craft in Pursuit Upon driving eastward out of Ames, the three of us noticed what appeared at first to be an orange triangle shaped object about 2 miles in front of us.  As we approached the object, it seemed to be growing bigger and also seemed to be getting closer although we had slowed down.  At this point, we turned the car around and started driving back toward Ames.  As we drove, the object continued to get bigger and grow closer.  The object seemed to maneuver toward us using very square and sudden turns.  As we approacted the outskirts of Ames, the object dropped it's pursuit and left the area very suddenly.  The objects altitutde appeared to be 600-800 ft.  One of the passengers of our vehicle has had a background with numerous sitings of unidentifiable objects in the past.  He has a broad understanding of aircraft design.;42.040805882353;-93.6229039215687
Gliding V-shaped object with lights;2015-11-19 20:30:00;<1 minute;Gliding V-shaped object with lights Saw a V-shaped or triangular-shaped object “gliding” in the sky at 20:30 in Ames.   It had a dark body outline with lights (hard to distinguish if the lights were underneath the body or glowing from inside the body if it was translucent).   The lights were pretty dim (pinkish-yellowish-peachish) but interestingly, they followed that V-shaped body pattern.   There was no noise, which is why I used the term gliding, and it was going at a decent pace.  The background was a clear night sky in Iowa with temperatures ~0 degree Celsius.;42.040805882353;-93.6229039215687
Three lights in a triangular formation.;2017-02-11 14:45:00;3 seconds;Three lights in a triangular formation. As my roommate was driving us home at around 2:45 AM I noticed three lights in a triangle in the northern sky.  At first I thought the lights were reflections on my window, because there could be no other light source in the area, but then I realized my window was down.  I was initially looking outside because there was supposed to be a meteor shower and eclipse that night.  It seemed that as soon as I noticed the lights, they disappeared.;42.040805882353;-93.6229039215687
