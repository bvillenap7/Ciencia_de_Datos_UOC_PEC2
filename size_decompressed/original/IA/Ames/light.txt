Four lights ascending, sitting stationary for awhile, then moving NE and disappearing;2001-05-09 23:53:00;10 minutes;Four lights ascending, sitting stationary for awhile, then moving NE and disappearing While noticing thunderstorm clouds in the sky, a bright white-yellow light ascended straight up from the treeline. We commented on how odd the sight of an aircraft was considering the heavy cloud cover. After ascending, the light remained stationary for approx. 3 minutes. We started driving our car towards the possible vicinity of the light, at which time we noticed it began moving in a NE direction. We were heading South, the light passed in front of us to our left. We still could not make out any shape of aircraft, but the light became clearer and we determined there were four yellowish lights with reddish halos. Then we started losing sight of it as it got farther away. Within a second of our last sighting, it completely vanished. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is anonymous.  PD));42.040805882353;-93.6229039215687
Craft making 90 degree jagged cuts.;2009-05-02 03:30:00;1 hour;Craft making 90 degree jagged cuts. Craft made super sharp 90 degree turns. It was just a bright light cutting across the sky.  Cellular service was disrupted while this was happening.  It's still out there.;42.040805882353;-93.6229039215687
Lights moving at same speed as aircraft, but no running lights. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS and Space Shuttle in formation?  PD));2009-09-09 20:45:00;4-5 min.;Lights moving at same speed as aircraft, but no running lights. 9-9-09  This evening my husband and I witnessed two bright objects moving across the sky from west to east at approximately 8:45 p.m. central. The reason we thought this was noteworthy is because there were no “running lights”... the red and green blinking lights we usually see on airplanes.  Also, these lights were much brighter.  The first one seemed to have vapor or smoke behind it, but not in a straight line as a contrail.  A few seconds later, another bright light passed over but we didn’t see any vapor.

However, the light then reappeared brighter than ever.   The object continued to travel from NW to SE across the sky at a very slow pace. There were no blinking lights to indicate this was an airplane.  The object was very low to the earth compared to the distance flown by airplanes. A low humming noise could be heard, but that may have been due to something else.;42.040805882353;-93.6229039215687

Bright red and orange lights and rapid chaotic movement.;2014-10-21 20:15:00;30 minutes;Bright red and orange lights and rapid chaotic movement Clear sky. Bright red light almost directly overhead passed from roughly east to west. Definitely not a plane as I saw many others of those at the same time.  Moved quickly but steadily.  As it moved away a similar object appeared moving on roughly the same path but was more orange in color.  Tracked both objects as they moved westerly when the orange object disappeared from sight.  Continued walking my dog for another 20 minutes or so but when I returned home I noted a twinkling red object lower on the western/northwestern horizon.  Thinking it might be the object I saw before I ran inside my home and grabbed binoculars.  When I focused in on the object it appeared to be a single point of light that was moving extremely rapidly but in a very random, haphazard way within a very confined bit of space.  The movements were so rapid that it appeared to produce a 'stream' of light with loops and zigzags, etc.  I checked  a nearby street lamp and rooflines to be sure it wa! sn't my hands shaking (they weren't).  Eventually  it moved lower and lower down onto the horizon and lost sight of it.  Have never seen or reported something like this before.

11 lights in a row traveling 3-4 times as fast as aircraft without any sound.  ((Starlink satellites??))((anonymous));2020-03-04 05:15:00;3 minutes;11 lights in a row traveling 3-4 times as fast as aircraft without any sound heading north east over central Iowa. This morning, Wed. 3/4/2020 at around 5:15 AM, over central Iowa, was seen, about 11 white lights, that were seen traveling in a row. Traveling at less than 1/10 of a second apart. Traveling at a heading north east going 3-4 times as fast as the other aircraft (with colored strobes) in the sky at the same time.  The white light they put out was the same shade, density and size as average planets.  None of them had any aviation strobes at all.  And jet aircraft in the sky at the same time could be heard, but these 11 lights all together traveling that close together, that fast and that low, made no noise whatever.;42.040805882353;-93.6229039215687

It disappeared, and popped up in the same place.  Moved in a circles rapidly and blinked again.  In a matter of seconds.;42.040805882353;-93.6229039215687
