Birght flashing light in sky;2000-09-24 23:25:00;5 min;Birght flashing light in sky As we were driving North on I-35 just south of the city of Ames Iowa, my wife noticed a bright flash of light, similar to a giant strobe light in the sky.  At first we thought it was a plane, but the flash was on a highly irregular pattern.  The light seemed to be quite high in the sky and very bright.  It also seemed to hover at times and then move across the sky before it flashed again.  The 3 kids in the back saw it as well.;42.040805882353;-93.6229039215687
Bright blue/white flash north/northwest of Huxley, IA;2012-01-10 22:30:00;3 seconds;bright blue/white flash north/northwest of Huxley, IA I was on my way to my overnight position, traveling north on I-35 in between Elkheart and Huxley, IA.   There were no visible clouds in the sky and no visual obstructions.  I saw a bright blue/white flash fly through the sky, north/northwest of me, seemingly moving towards the Earth from my perspective.  It was very brief, and way brighter than a shooting star or satellite.  The car in front of me clearly saw it aswell, because they veered into the other lane briefly as though they were distracted.;42.040805882353;-93.6229039215687
