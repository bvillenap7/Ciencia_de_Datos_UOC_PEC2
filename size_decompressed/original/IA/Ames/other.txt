I am an Aerospace engineer, so I have familiarity with flying crafts.  This was like none I have ever seen in my entire whole life.  I was camping with the family since it is winter there are no leaves so the sky is wholly visible.  I was tending the campfire, thinking about this and that, when all of a sudden blam!  Two white spheroids appeared before my very eyes.  They were about a quarter mile away, just seeming to float.  They merged together into one unit, though it maintened separate parts.  It was making strange noises as well, though it mixed with the sounds of the woods to make it indistinct.  When the two spheroids came together, I don't mean to be crude, but it resembled a human buttocks.  It kind of shook around and made me angry.  I didn't like it one bit, but can't really say why.  The two-in-one was the only one I observed, and the only one I ever care to.  After a while, five minutes at the most, it went dark, and its luminescence faded from the bottom up to the top, till it was completely gone.  I didn't have the presence of mind to wake up my wife and kids, but I assure you I have seen such an object.  Please let me know if this correlates with others' experiences.  Thanks you for your valuable work.;42.040805882353;-93.6229039215687
