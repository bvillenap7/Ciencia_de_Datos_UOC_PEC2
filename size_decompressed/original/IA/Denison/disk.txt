One mile south of denison I noticed the SR71 Blackbird on a southeast to northwest trajectory with photo optics bulb deployed.When it passed me to the west I noticed a saucer shaped craft zig-zagging across the sky to the north west were it stood motionless for a few minutes then faded to the west. ((NUFORC Note:  We were not aware that the SR-71 has a photo optics bulb on it, moreover, one that deploys.  Still further, we doubt that it would be deployed so it would be visible from the ground, and we doubt that it would activate its cameras at a low enough altitude so an observer could witness all of this.  Finally, we believe the SR-71 was deactivated and removed from the USAF roster before 1997.  PD));42.0203;-95.3667
