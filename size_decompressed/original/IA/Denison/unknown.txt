Red Geometic Amebia;1975-06-30 17:00:00;2 minutes;Red Geometic Amebia I was seven years old with my six year old brother when we seen the unusual object.  We looked at what we thought was the setting sun.  It was a red sphere and glowed like the sun, then as I watched it started to morph into a triangle.  It shifted shape slowely then it became a square, then a rectangle then at the time I thought a covered wagon, but now I know it was a cylinder.  It decended as a cylinder slowely below the tree tops.  We ran inside and told my dad, he came out immediately but didn't see anything.  He pointed out that the sun was still high in the sky behind our backs.  He called the police because we were visible scared, but the police didn't have any other reports.  Thanks for your time.
