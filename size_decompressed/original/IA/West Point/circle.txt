Large thin orange crescent with outline lights low in sky changed size possible mirage.;2007-02-19 20:00:00;2 min.;Large thin orange crescent with outline lights low in sky changed size possible mirage. Driving west after dark we saw a large, thin orange crescent low in the sky ahead of us.  At first we thought it might be the moon, but it was too large.  (Had watched the new moon and Venus, just after sunset, the previous night - the crescent we are reporting was much larger, appearing to be the outline of the bottom a very large circle. It grew larger, then smaller, then vanished.  There appeared to be indistinct small lights along  it, and a bright orange light near the tip of the crescent (on the right). We wonder about the possibility of a mirage, as the conditions were rather humid from melting snow, and there is a highway intersection several miles west of this location which is lighted by an orange light on a pole, on the right.  If this was a mirage, it seems to have been displaced to the south of the actual location of the intersection.;40.7134;-91.4367
Round/circular orange object, north to south.;2015-08-03 21:45:00;1.5 minutes;Round/circular orange object, north to south. So does anyone have any ideas, or are there any other witnesses?!   Myself and 3 other adults seen an orange glowing object in the sky over iowa (Lee County) about 9:45-10:00 pm on 8/3/2015.  At first I thought it was one of those glowing lantern things people let go near the 4th.   It traveled from north to south fairly fast, it took approx. 1.5 mins. from one horizon to the other.   Also, after about 5-6 mins. a second orange glowing ball/circle appeared and did the exact same thing as the first they looked identical, it could have been two different objects or maybe the same one??   Also it didn't have a tail.  It was just an orange round ball, traveling through the sky.   It was father away than any plane or jet I've seen!;40.7134;-91.4367
