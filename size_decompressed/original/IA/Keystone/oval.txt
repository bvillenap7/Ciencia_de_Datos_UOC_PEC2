It was somewhat oblong white with a warm yellow center and it all glowed/ somewhat the shape of a full moon but oblong.  I first saw this 3/8/07 between 8:30-9:00. At that time there were two red objects, they were observed closer to the ground and higher moving in erratic patterns/ almost like searching through the fields. I tried to take a picture. It hung there after I noticed it for about 20 minutes. On going out to try to observe the red lights vanished and I saw a twinkling object moving rapidly across the stars in again erratic patterns. It looked like a star with red and green lights. I observed another   object similar, closer to the ground and the white object was gone.  I have since observed this only further away appearing as a huge bright light, somewhat Y shaped. I have since observed this happening multiple times to current date 3/13/07.  My husband also observed the larger light.  It seems to have become a nightly occurrence. When the light is in the sky for some time my Rottwielers outside start howling and the house Rott growls;42.0161;-92.2168
