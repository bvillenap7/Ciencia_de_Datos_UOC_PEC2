Very large, bright green object with tail streaking across night sky in southern Winneshiek County, Iowa.  ((anonymous));2016-04-15 22:15:00;5 seconds;Very large, bright green object with tail streaking across night sky in southern Winneshiek County, Iowa. On April 15, 2016, I was working in my farm field, when at approximately 10:15 p.m., I witnessed a large, bright green object, with a tail, streak across the sky, going northeast to southeast.  It came at about a 45 degree downward angle and suddenly disappeared at what appeared to be 250 ft. above ground. The size of this object was considerably larger than a typical falling star and definitely green in color.  By stretching my arm out about 3-4 feet the object was about the size of a golf ball.  I would guess the object was anywhere from two to ten miles away from me. My wife was at home, about 1/4 mile from the farm field. I called to tell her of my sighting and she said our dog was unusually excited and nervous. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
