I came to the end of the drive and was on a upward slant.  As I was stopped I was facing slightly upward to the sky.  I saw a giant fireball over Cedar Rapids.  It was really bright and I was in the country off of Highway 151.  I never heard any more about it.  I was only 18 at the time.  I told my friend and they said they had seen ufo's in the sky too.  They didn't say fireballs though. I was delivering a pizza to a house out of town.  I was returning towards a gravel rode from a suburb.  I came to the end of the drive and was on a upward slant.
