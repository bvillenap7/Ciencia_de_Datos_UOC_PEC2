small version of Orion's Belt.;2002-12-25 21:45:00;10 seconds;small version of Orion's Belt. We were about 3 miles east of Anamosa, Ia when I saw 3 bright lights suddenly appear about 40 degrees up from the horizon in the northwestern sky. They did not flash and were white in color. There were 3 lights in a perfectly straight line tilted about 30 degrees to the right. It looked like a smaller version of Orion's Belt, about 3/4 the size. The far left & far right lights were slightly brighter than the center light. My 17 year old son was sitting in the front seat also and he saw the same thing. After about 10 seconds the lights faded out suddenly. There weren't any clouds in the sky. We do a lot of stargazing and I've never seen a constellation like this in the northwest. The lights were too far apart to be an airplane. Maybe satellites tumbling at EXACTLY the same time ? Anybody else see this ? There's probably a good explanation.;42.1103;-91.2886
