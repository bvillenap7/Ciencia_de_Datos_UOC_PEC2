strange shit in the sky in sac county iowa.;2005-10-11 21:00:00;10 seconds;strange ((deleted--sighting)) in the sky in sac county iowa. I saw 4 bright orange light apear on after another ant the disapear in the the same order that they showed up. This only took about 5 seconds, but they were lined up in a straight line (north to south) straight above my car.  Then about 2 minutes later the same thing happened but this time the lights were west to east and a little north of of my car.   This was the strangest ((deleted profanity)) that i have ever seen.  The whole time the lights didnt move from where they showed up.;42.2674;-95.0888
