Slow moving boomerang moves across a Central Iowa town.;2005-09-01 21:50:00;2-3 min.;Slow moving boomerang moves across a Central Iowa town. I was driving home from Wal-Mart. I looked up & saw these strange lights in the sky. I made a couple of turns to get a better look at it.  It was shaped like a boomarang. Lots of lights on the nose. Very quiet, no noise that I could hear.  There was a slight haze around it.  It moved slowly.  The lights were very bright.  I made a couple of more turns to get away from the light pollution I looked back to where I saw it & it was gone.  I scanned the sky but didn´t see it anymore.  I´m not one to talk about these kind of things. But this is totally FREAKY!!!!!;42.0727;-93.8717999999999
