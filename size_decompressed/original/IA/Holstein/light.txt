On the night of February 17, I was coming home and saw a bright ball of light in the sky.  As I was looking at more closely I saw that it had a ring of red lights underneath it and seemed to follow me when I turned a corner and continued to follow me till I got home.  Then it sat there for a long time.;42.4971;-95.5716
