Time manipulation after possible abduction.;2005-05-10 15:00:00;unknown;Time manipulation after possible abduction. I was staying the night at a friends house and we had been up late.  At about 3 in the morning, we both woke up, but soon fell back asleep.  It had been no more than 5 minutes when we both woke up again, but it was 5 in the morning.  Her clock was not a digital clock, so I believe it couldn't have malfuctioned the way it did.  Her siblings were much to young and not tall enough to reach the clock and play a prank and the only other adults in the house were asleep and hadn't come down to the basement where we were.   I would have brushed it off as nothing, however I was aware that in certain situations, such as an abduction, time can be manipulated.  I have not told anyone about my experience for fear of ridicule. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));42.4971;-95.5716
