This early morning I was traveling south out of Dubuque, Ia on highway 151 near Cascade,Ia. I as always looking out my windshield noticed a object streaking across the sky once again it came from behind and was going away from me. I know this to be unnatural movement of light for I have seen planes flying at night and shooting / falling stars before and in fact seen 2 falling stars the following early morning west bound hwy 20 in Iowa. This was a solid streak of bright white light,no tail no simular looks of anything else that I had seen before.  Just streaking from East to west over Iowa.;42.2838;-91.0176
