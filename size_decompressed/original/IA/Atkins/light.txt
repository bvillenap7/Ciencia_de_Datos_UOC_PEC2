Green lights over field near Cedar Rapids, Iowa, shot off into space;2020-01-07 21:00:00;4 seconds;Green lights over field near Cedar Rapids, Iowa, shot off into space Was traveling along the highway near Atkins Iowa, just outside of Cedar Rapids, and looked out of the passenger window to my right seeing what appeared to be a plane sized object with green lights (that obscured the actual shape, about 3 lights from what I could tell) hovering above the field. Upon me noticing the object was oddly stationary it shot up and to the left, giving a 'penny in water' type effect as stuff seemingly moved around it. When it shot off it left a green trail. No further sightings on that drive.;41.9881;-91.876
