Bright bronze light in low Eastern horizon, slowly moving North sighted in Adel, IA.;2017-02-09 20:30:00;5 minutes;Bright bronze light in low Eastern horizon, slowly moving North sighted in Adel, IA. At approximately 8:30 PM CST, Thursday, February 9th, I witnessed a bright twinkling bronze light on the Eastern horizon.  The object bore resemblance to the iconic “North Star,” but much larger and seemly closer.   At first I thought it might be a street light, as it was stationary and in comparable size to one roughly half a block down from me, until it began to move behind the street light in my view.  I saw the object gradually move North, while maintaining its position on the horizon.  I made a quick effort to locate my phone, in hopes of taking a picture, but by the time I returned, the object was steadily moving out of my line of sight, until I lost track of it beyond the trees.   My guess was this may have been a satellite, but I have no way to confirm. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.

Gold light resembling a shooting star darts across Eastern sky, instantly veers upwards, then disappears.  ((anonymous report));2017-03-07 22:00:00;1 second;Gold light resembling a shooting star darts across Eastern sky, instantly veers upwards, then disappears in Adel, IA. On March 7th, around 10:00 PM CST, overhead high in the Eastern sky a tiny, round, gold light appeared from no apparent origin, shot across a section of the (about 6 inches in my field of vision), and in an instant zipped upwards with an immediate change of direction before vanishing.  There seemed to be a brief trail, but it happened so quickly, I am unsure due to its speed.   Everything about this object, except for the quick change of course, resembled a shooting star, but I could not find any reports for comets. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witness, who prefers to remain anonymous.  He sounded to us to be serious-minded, and he confirmed that the date indicated above is correct, and that the date of the sighting was not April 07th, as we initially had suspected.
