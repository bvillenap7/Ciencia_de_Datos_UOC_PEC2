Fireball changing speed and direction witnessed by two near Sumner, IA. Second sighting at this location.;2014-07-26 01:00:00;2-4 minutes;Fireball changing speed and direction witnessed by two near Sumner, IA. Second sighting at this location Upon walking out of a house to get to my car, I looked at the stars and noticed movement. Around 500 yds from ground and over a mile away was a red-orange fireball moving North, then SW and stopped. I asked a friend to look for anything odd in the sky, and the witness immediately noticed, stating this was the second time he saw a fireball at this location within a month.  Using hunting binoculars, I was able to steady the view to confirm that the fireball was moving quickly once again.  I did this by focusing the binoculars on a star, then witnessing the red light cross the star and continue going. Witness and I watched the light change course, from going N/NE to slowing, then heading W for a short distance before regaining course N, until the fireball was behind the treeline.  Calm and clear night in a rural area, the object didn't make any noise. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.8409;-92.1135
