It was orange with a little bit of red, and when my grandpa was out it was about 15x the size from when I saw it.  There weren't any blinking lights or sounds, and it was just going one direction.  I'm going to guess it was only a mile and a half away, because it was still pretty big when I got to see it.  It was moving pretty fast, and flying really low.  But not really low.;41.046;-94.3458
