Myself (67) and my son (38) had just gotten home and were about to go in the house.  I looked up to see the pretty, bright moon.  Sky was clear and I saw a round, bright glowing sphere moving from east to west almost above us.  Hard to know how high but I would say higher than propeller planes fly.   It was silent and no blinking lights.  It flew in a straight line for about 10 seconds, and then to our shock.. it stopped!  That is when we went into the house!   I looked out our south window and kept track of it.  It moved very, very slowly east and by the time I went to bed at 1:45 a.m. it was sitting in the west sky above our town - not moving.  So, I don't know what time it moved on.;42.3131;-93.6381
