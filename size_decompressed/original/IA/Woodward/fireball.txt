While driving home from work I watched very bright orange/gold lights seeming to play in the sky. It was fairly early in the evening.  Only 5:15pm central time so it wasnâ€™t extremely dark yet. These lights caught and held my attention since there is pretty much nothing but farm fields in the area of these lights.  I was watching them trying to remember if there is anything new in the area.  There is not. While I was watching, these lights seemed to be moving  in a leap frog type fashion across the sky.  I have never seen anything like this before.;41.8454;-93.9003
