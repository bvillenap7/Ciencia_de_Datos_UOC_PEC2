I was brushing my teeth when my husband hollared for me. He was standing looking out our back window that faces a field. He said, 'look at the light, it's not moving' it was far too close to be a star. He decided he was going to go out and look for it. I stayed by the window, cell phone in hand. He called and said it seemed a lot farther out than he had thought. The object was moving lower and farther away it appeared until it finally disappeared from my sight. Right before it disappeared I called him to tell him I could barely see it. He said he couldn't either. Like that, it was gone. This is the second time my husband has seen this particular shape, although last time it was a lot closer. Roughly 200 feet off the ground and right above the edge of the field behind our home. He was walking 2 houses down to his moms, the object paced him. He could see the object had no markings with three lights under each point of the triangle. This took place on March 21s! t 2009. Like I have stated we have a field right behind our home and live about a half mile from a state intitution.;41.8454;-93.9003
