Driving on westbound I-235 in Windsor Heights, IA, when my husband and I noticed what at first looked like three lights in a triangular pattern, but upon driving closer to the lights we noticed that it was five lights in a chevron pattern, very low in the sky.  The craft was hovering about 250 feet from the ground just south of the interstate for about 2 minutes, then slowly moved east for about ten to fifteen seconds before zooming south and out of sight in less than five seconds.  While there is an airport about ten miles from where we spotted the craft, it was far too low to be an airplane, as they stay well over 3,500 feet in the air in that same area of town.;41.6044;-93.7195
