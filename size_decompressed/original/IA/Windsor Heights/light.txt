We saw a bright red light during a fireworks display in Des Moines.;2000-07-04 21:00:00;hour;We saw a bright red light during a fireworks display in Des Moines. My family and I were waiting to watch the fireworks display in Colby Park, Windsor Heights (Des Moines), Iowa.  We were facing west, watching the sun set.  As the fireworks began, I found I was drawn to a bright red light just to the right of the fireworks.  I pointed it out to my husband and we speculated on it.  If it was moving, it was very slowly towards us because we couldn't discern much, if any, motion.  We thought it must be a plane and tried to focus on the fireworks.  But we kept being drawn back to it because it wasn't behaving like any plane we'd seen and it didn't seem to be at the right altitude either.  It stayed there a long time and we heard others around us pointing it out as well.  It was there through the whole display and possibly longer (we had to get the children home). Later, the local free paper ran an article on a local UFO investigator and the recent sighting.  The report mentioned the light moving from West Des Moines to Windsor Heights and that it was seen to have dropped 1 or 2 objects (flashing red lights, I believe they said), but we hadn't seen that.  Of course, looking near and through fireworks likely obscured any other blinking red lights!  Many people in the city saw it, since so many of us were out for the holiday shows.  A follow-up report in the same paper said that it could not have been a plane, fireworks, weather balloon, etc.  There is no explanation as of yet.  I am probably just one of many voices reporting this sighting, but I thought I'd add what we saw that night in case it helps.
