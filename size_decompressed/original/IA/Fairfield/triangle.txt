Corners were glowing triangles While watching for meteors,observed a triangle shaped object fly from north to south.At each corner of object was a triangle that glowed a pinkish white.At first it appeared to be 3 objects flying in formation.When it flew past Oriens belt the area between objects blacked out the stars that make up oriens belt.The object did not make any sound and left no contrail.I'm unsure of how high object was flying but appeared low.There was zero cloud cover and no loud noise that would have drowned out noise from craft.;41.0014;-91.9578
MUFON/IOWA FOLLOW-UP REPORT:  Low-altitude triangle with triangular shaped pinkish-white lights at angles.;2003-11-19 00:30:00;2-3 minutes;Low-altitude triangle with triangular shaped pinkish-white lights at angles. REPORTED TO NUFORC 11/20/2003 2:56:31 PM 14:56.  Investigated by Iowa MUFON, Glen Singley.  On November 19, 2003, at 12:30 a.m., witnesses had purposely gone out to watch for meteors, and saw a silent triangle fly overhead so that they could view its underside, and watch it move from north to south so slowly that it took 3-4 minutes for it to disappear from view.  Altitude estimate is 400-500 feet.  [NOTE: Witnesses specify TRIANGULAR SHAPED PINKISH-WHITE GLOWING LIGHTS at each angle of the triangle.  It should be noted that Iowa MUFON has investigated another case recently where triangular-shaped lights were also noted, although the lights were not at the apices of the triangle, but rather along the sides of the triangle.]  At first, witnesses thought they were seeing 3 objects instead of just one, but when the object passed in front of Orion's Belt, they saw that it obscured some stars in the cluster, and that it was one object. ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to MUFON/IOWA for the report, and for their having followed up on the sighting report.  PD));41.0014;-91.9578
