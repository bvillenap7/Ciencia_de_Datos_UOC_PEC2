Just after nightfall I observed a cluster of white blinking lights high overhead, moving steadily in a westerly direction.;2003-10-07 19:30:00;20 seconds;Just after nightfall I observed a cluster of white blinking lights high overhead, moving steadily in a westerly direction. I was walking home, headed west.  It was nearly dark and the full moon was behind me.  I looked up, noticing a bright star and wondered if it were Mars. Then I saw a white blinking light high overhead which I assumed was a plane, traveling northward. Then another blinking light caught my eye, quite a bit lower than the first.  Almost immediately I saw that this second light was accompanied by 5 or 6 more. They were all blinking, moving fairly quickly off to the west. They resembled a group of fireflies, yet their movements and the blinking seemed co-ordinated, not random, and they appeared to remain equidistant from one another.  Before I could discern a pattern or definite shape to the formation, it disappeared behind the trees on the horizon. I heard no sound. I've watched meteor showers before, and as a child once saw a spectacular auroral display, but have never experienced a UFO sighting. Whatever this was, it was a lovely sight...;41.0014;-91.9578
