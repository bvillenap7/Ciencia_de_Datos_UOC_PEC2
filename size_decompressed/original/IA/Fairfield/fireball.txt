Greenish apearing fireball with spark tail heading slowly eastward.;1999-11-16 18:05:00;15 seconds;Greenish apearing fireball with spark tail heading slowly eastward. I greenish fireball heading East. No idea how near or far. Spark tail. First impression was a firework left over from 4th, but it traveled across sky and did not diminish. After 10-15 seconds its path took it out of our sightlines behind trees. It was the first of the two Leonid nights, and when I heard that I assumed that's what we saw, but then I heard that fireballs weren't part of Leonid and NUFORC was taking reports on them. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the witness observed the object(s) on 16NO99.  We have changed the date here.));41.0014;-91.9578
