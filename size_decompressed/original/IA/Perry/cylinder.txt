36 bright objects flying across the sky in a short amount of time;2010-06-17 20:00:00;15 - 20 min;36 bright objects flying across the sky in a short amount of time At first site I thought someone had lost a mylar balloon but upon closer inspection it was decided the item was too large and moving in a manner not consistent with a balloon.   While watching, we started to see one after the other traveling from west to east in the southern sky at about a 45 degree angle from where the moon was in the evening sky.  A very few were seen flying from east to west.  Those that were, were closer and almost looked like airplanes.  They were very bright.  We thought perhaps it was the sun reflecting off of planes however the closest airport is smaller and does not accommodate a large number of planes.  We started counting the objects and saw approximately 36 items.   When we had gotten to about 30 we saw a jet stream in the sky above one of the items.  You could see the stream but not the jet itself leading us to believe that the objects were possibly something other than standard airplanes.  A couple were closer than others and emi! tted a bright white light.  It was close to dusk so we thought it possibly reflection of the sun. It was just very odd to see such a large number of items even if they were just planes.  We could not determine that so to us they were UFOâ€™s.;41.8369;-94.1101
