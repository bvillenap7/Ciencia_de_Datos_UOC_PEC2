I was carrying in some groceries and I saw a flickering orange-red light up above the horizon. The sky was perfectly clear with no clouds. At first, I thought maybe it was a planet or something until it started moving. It seemed to rise slowly while zigzagging back and forth. After watching it for a little over a minute it completely disappeared. The object looked to be a mile or two away west-southwest toward Dawson. I live out in the country surrounded by farmland so I have a pretty good view all around me. This is probably the 3rd time in the last two months I've seen this same light around my house. Also, I saw several planes out and about but as far as I know it didn't make any sound at all.;41.8369;-94.1101
