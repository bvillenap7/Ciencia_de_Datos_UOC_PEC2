Very fast moving light(green), south of Perry, IA;2009-01-02 19:45:00;very short;Very fast moving light(green), south of Perry, IA We were south of Perry, Iowa, traveling north to the city of Perry, when out of nowhere there was a flash of green (like the color of a stoplight) in the sky.   It went down towards the earth very, very, very quickly and then just disappeared.   My daughter and I were the ones that noticed it.  I saw it full on, she caught a glimpse out of the corner of her eye.   The sky was dark with no noticeable stars.  I was totally freaked out as I have never ever seen anything like this in my 40 years.;41.8369;-94.1101
