Large, bright white lights appear in a straight line and then disappear;2001-09-21 20:45:00;5 minutes;Large, bright white lights appear in a straight line and then disappear While watching a local football game, several of us observed a line of 4-5 very large, bright white lights in the low Southern sky.  They were close together and seemed to be coming from one source.  These lights would all disappear and then reappear again in a different location, moving to the north and west.  We observed this 5 times before the lights disappeared.  These lights seemed quite low to the horizon and yet we could hear no noise such as you might from a plane.  The other odd thing was that during this time we noticed a very strong and overwhelming manure type odor.  Since this area is near a cattle farm that would not be unusual, except there was no breeze that night and this odor appeared very suddenly, lasted several minutes and then just went away.;43.3197;-95.1628
