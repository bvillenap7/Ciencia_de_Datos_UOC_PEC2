Unusual light in sky 7/4/10 from Saylorville campground.;2010-07-04 22:15:00;10 Minutes;Unusual light in sky 7/4/10 from Saylorville campground. Sunday, July 4, 2010, approx 10:20 PM. The sky had  a very unusual appearance that night.  In the west and northwest there was a band of light-colored sky extending from the horizon upward about 15 degrees.  (Usually at this time of evening at this latitude, the sky is entirely dark.)   At the edge of this band of light the sky turned very dark.  In the dark area there appeared an unusual “disc” of gold or orange-colored light.  It stood out in stark contrast to its nearly black surrounding.  The disc stayed in a fixed position at about 75 degrees up in the NW sky for several minutes, then appeared to “drift” several degrees – perhaps 10 – upward and northward, then stopped again before fading away.  The night sky was cloudy and it looked like the disc faded out, it was not covered up by the clouds. The disc reminded me of the symbol for a hurricane on a weather map.  It was round, but had one point instead of the two found on the hurricane symbol.  It was also blurry and indistinct. The diameter of the disc appeared to be between a quarter and a half of the diameter of a full moon.  Of course, not knowing either the size of the disc or its distance from my location, it is impossible to “guesstimate” either value.;41.7536;-93.6927
