Transparent triangle object heading southeast.;2013-11-10 00:15:00;4 seconds;Transparent triangle object heading southeast At about 12:15 am I witnessed a weird triangle shaped object.  It was about 5 or 6 hundred feet in the air.  I only witnessed the object for 4 or 5 seconds before it left.  It looked like it was moving slow but it disappeared fast.  The craft was small like a crop dusting plane but silent.  It was a light almost see through orange.  It was moving south east;41.2907;-95.916
