Star like object going into faster than light travel.;2018-07-20 23:30:00;1-2 minutes;Star like object going into faster than light travel. While camping in the remote area of White Rock, with sky's so dark you can see the milky way, my boyfriend and I were observing what we thought was a satellite before we noticed the strange flight pattern.  The object was a bright white light similar to a planet or a star.As we watched, the object was slowy moving in a zigzag type pattern for around 1 minute before suddenly taking off in a straight line at a much faster speed.  It then flashed bright yellow and took off incredbly fast leaving a trail of light and disappeared.;41.8911;-94.6847
