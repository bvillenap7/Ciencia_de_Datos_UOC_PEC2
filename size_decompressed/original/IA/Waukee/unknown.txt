pulsating, glowing orange object floating to the northwest of waukee, ia;2009-03-19 06:20:00;2-3 minutes;pulsating, glowing orange object floating to the northwest of waukee, ia I did not have my glasses on and by the time I found them, it was too far off.  I am very familiar with air craft, because I grew up with them, with my father being in the Air Force for 25 years.   What I saw was this, a pulsating orange glow, with a red intermitent light, no sound at all and was flying at about 3,000 feet in the air.  It was to the West over Waukee, IA, traveling North West and traveling very slow.   Because I did not have my glasses on, I was unable to see the exact structure, but I do know it was not a plane or a helicopter.  It was low enough, that I should have been able to hear it.  Were there any reportings in this area, on 3/19/2009 or 3/20/2009.   I tried to wake my wife up, but I couldn't get her up in time and she thought I was crazy.  I just happened to be closing the bedroom window, as it had cooled down so much overnight. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

star-like object, high in the night sky, blinking rapidly between red, white, green and possibly blue. ((NUFORC Note:  Vega??  PD));2012-05-13 21:45:00;unknown.  It is still out;star-like object, high in the night sky, blinking rapidly between red, white, green and possibly blue. Twice in the past week or so, my son and I have observed a light in the sky that looks like a star at first glance, but we notice that it is “blinking” too rapidly and in an unusual way….very quickly flashing red, white, and green (and possibly blue).  Our binoculars aren’t that sophisticated, but it doesn’t look like a plane.  It just looks like a bright star that is changing colors very rapidly.  I can’t focus my binoculars well enough at that distance or zoom far enough to make out a shape.  The first time we saw it last week, it was in the southwest sky.  Tonight, it is in the east.  It is about half way up in the sky.  It hasn’t moved or flown away or disappeared while we are watching it.  We eventually go inside, so I don’t know how long it lasts.  We watched it about 10-15 minutes tonight. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Vega?  PD));41.59;-93.8603999999998
