Strange Light Circles Waukee/Clive Iowa;2005-04-07 01:30:00;1 hour;Strange Light Circles Waukee/Clive Iowa I was shaking carpets, outside on my deck at about 1:30am.  Thinking about leaving them out for the night.  When I looked up at the sky to see if it looked like rain.  Something caught my eye, a light.  It was partly cloudy out.  It was as if I was looking at the bottom of a stingray shaped light circling the sky and it was the bottom of the craft. Which was above the clouds.  It was going from a distinct oval shape to a distinct circle.  Around and around, sometimes the circle would get larger then smaller.  It would take approx six seconds to complete the location.  I ran inside and got my two sons.  One was either sceptical or scared and went back in.  The other stayed.  We were on my top deck, it was very dark and we watched a good half hour.  During the sighting we saw twinkles of light coming from the craft, and some time what looked like windows of light. It lasted until we went to bed.  Waiting for the light again tonight, to see if it reappears.  It's 21:30 clear night nothing yet.......;41.59;-93.8603999999998

Multiple bright yellow-red circular lights sighted travelling SW to NE over Waukee towards Des Moines.;2013-10-25 22:15:00;7 minutes;Multiple bright yellow-red circular lights sighted travelling SW to NE over Waukee towards Des Moines. Sighting seen moving from the SW to NE began with a singular bright white glowing circular object remained stationary.  Seconds later,  bright reddish-yellow circular lights were sighted traveling in the same direction first upwards, then each light traveled singularly NE towards the SW lights of West/Des Moines.  Then each light disappeared at the same point (location) in the sky.  The nighttime skies appeared clear other than wind and a few aircraft, the lights were silent.  The lights moved at a moderate and steady pace until each object's disappearance.;41.59;-93.8603999999998
