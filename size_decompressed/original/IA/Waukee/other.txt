Bright organge light- goes off and looks atom-shaped.;2011-08-28 20:30:00;3 minutes;Bright organge light- goes off and looks atom-shaped. Was going on a walk about 8:30.  Noticed a very bright yellow/orange object moving east/west. Thought it might be a plane, but it was too bright.  Light was emitting from the front, but not the sides (like the wingspan of an insect).  As it proceeded to fly overhead, the light suddenly went off. It was high enough that it was momentarily lost in the clouds.  Still could see a small faint red light circling around the dark object.  Then, it started to fall, descending closer to us. The faint light disappeared. Now the object appeared to be only a few hundred feet above.  This time it looked like the object was atom-shaped.  There was a dark mass in the center, with three spheres orbiting around the object.  It also seemed to have condensed into a 4 x 4 foot object (which is strange because when it was higher in the sky it looked like it could have been a plane). It looked like it could potentially land somewhere, so we started sprinting towards the direction of the object, but lost it in the house lines. The object made no sound the entire time. We tried walking around the neighborhoods, but because it is a suburban area, most backyards are fenced and we couldn't see.  There was also a wooded area nearby where it could have possibly landed.  We couldn't find anything and no one seemed to be outside, which was strange. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
