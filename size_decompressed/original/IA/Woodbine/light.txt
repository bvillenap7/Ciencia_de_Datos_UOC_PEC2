A bright light that would appear to hover over several towns.  No chopper noises associated with it.  Movement was side to side up and down.  Seemed to hover most of the time.  Light would appear then dim to barely visible such as a weak star.  Then the light would get bright all of a sudden.  While hovering over town it seemed to move north west very slowly.  Altitude seemed to be lower that what most aircraft travel.;41.735;-95.6996
