Orange oval.;2014-09-04 22:15:00;10 seconds;orange oval My wife and I were sitting outside and saw a orange circle come from the west flying low.   We watched it for about 10 seconds and then it disappeared as fast as it appeared.   This is not the first time we have seen this.  Two years ago we saw one come towards our house and hoover for about 30 seconds and it disappeared.   Later that summer we saw three come from the west again.;41.9299;-93.0841
