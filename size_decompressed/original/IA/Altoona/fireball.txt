We just saw a bright orange-red, round, flying object that was moving far faster than any plane.  It appeared to be on a level flight so it wasn't descending.  It did not fade, like you'd think a meteor would.  It streaked across the sky, over the moon, as low as 15-20K feet, but no sound, no trail.  Very strange.  They're testing drones around here, so we think maybe that's what it was?    We're a college-educated, middle-aged couple from the Midwest.   My husband works in Information Technology and I work in Office Management.   We've never seen anything this bright and colorful in the night sky.;41.6473;-93.4744
Bright orange ball over Iowa;2019-09-30 20:57:00;2 minutes;Bright orange ball over Iowa At approximately 20:57-20:59, there was a bright orange fireball over Iowa.  It traveled straight down extremely fast, and appeared as it was almost a large meteorite falling from the sky.  Once it got about 100 feet from the ground,  The light completely went out and it disappeared into the clear sky.  There were never any sounds and I was waiting for the sound of impact but it never came.;41.6473;-93.4744
