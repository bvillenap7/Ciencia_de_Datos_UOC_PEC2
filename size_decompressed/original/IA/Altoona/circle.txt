It flew over a normal plane travelling at regular altitude speed that was heading SW.  The ISS is currently east of Africa over the ocean.  I know there are more satellites but this was bright, traveling quickly, and seems to be much higher than a plane travelling @ several thousand feet.  Interested in seeing what this was.  I've reported a similar sighting to mufon Iowa, but the report system there isn't working.  Large circle, bright as a star, slightly larger than the brightest stars you will see in the night sky, and appears to look like it's floating, almost to flying in a perfectly straight path.  Never changed direction, probably a satellite, but still very cool.;41.6473;-93.4744
