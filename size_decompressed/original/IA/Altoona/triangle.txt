A group of neighbors and myself noticed strange lights in the sky to the West.  It was hovering in one place, not moving to indicate being an airplane.  The lights on the object seemed to jump and shift.  Upon getting binoculars to look more closely it was triangular shaped with multi-colored lights on the bottom of it that shifted and blinked in patterns.  It remained in the same spot over 12 minutes with the light patterns changing regularly.  It then slowly moved south-west and disappeared on the horizon.  The observers ranged in age from 7 years old to 45 years old from varied backgrounds.;41.6473;-93.4744
