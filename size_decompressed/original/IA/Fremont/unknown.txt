At about 2:00 a.m. I woke up to find my now exwife very quiet in her sleeping.She was a very heavy breather due to her past smoking habit. I reached over to shake her to see if she would start breathing and this gargoyle type creature arose out of her body and stood up beside the bed. It looked at me and then proceeded to walk through the wall. I wrote to two people the next day and told my associate at school the next day. I proceeded to forget the incident until February 27, 2003, when events unfolded in my life which have since led me down my own path of events similiar to  the book called The Celestine Prophesy.  I have met people like Dr. Shakundali Modi who has been studying this phenomenon for 20 years and Barbara Bartholic in Tulsa who has been studying this phenomenon for 30 years.  Some of the ramifications of this case have led me to be dismissed by the Iowa MUFON Chapter.  This sighting has been the catalyst for a book that I will cover this case and others in my ten years of investigating UFO's and other phenomenon in Iowa. (And by the way, I also had a case in my classroom where I watched a student shapeshift into a Reptilian and back in about 10 seconds. This parallels what David Icke talks about in some of his books.;41.2075;-92.4359
