Wierd flash of light;2006-09-20 23:04:00;A few seconds;Wierd flash of light At approx. 11:04 P.M. last night (Sep. 20 2006) I went outside to have a cigarette.  My golden retriever Mia came out with me.  I'm somewhat of a stargazer, I've seen odd things in the sky before but nothing worth reporting.  I satellite watch as a hobby, so I know what is an unusual object in the sky.  It was a beautiful night, with no clouds.  Suddenly to the W-NW I saw a brilliant flash of light.  It was way too cold to be lightning.  My dog immediatly reacted, and bolted back to the house.  I could tell she was frightened.  It only lit up the western sky, not the whole sky like how lighting does.  I lasted only a few seconds, but long enough to freak me and my dog out.;42.3025;-90.6147
