After hovering for a few moments at a curiously low altitude, it began rapidly flying toward us.  The object grew intensely brighter as it moved closer. It flew directly over us and toward the western horizon.  As it flew over us, we thought we were able to make out a dark, triangle shape craft, but the lights on the craft were so intensely bright, that it was difficult to tell for certain. The bright amber colored light that we had initially seen in the distance  was at its tail a smaller red light at it's nose, and two extremely bright, white, flashing strobe like lights on its wings.   It was large and flying at an unusually low altitude. It was not silent, but oddly quiet for how low it appeared to be flying. I don't know that I can even describe what it sounded like.   We watch planes fly over toward the Eastern Iowa Airport on a nightly basis.   This looked and sounded like no plane I have ever seen.;41.9265;-91.4342
