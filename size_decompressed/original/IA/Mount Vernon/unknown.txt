I have a picture.;2011-05-05 07:00:00;unknown;I have a picture. stepped outside at 0700 Friday Morning (05/05/11).  Grabbed my phone out of my car and snapped a picture of my new house to show friends at work.  When I enlarged the picture on my computer at work, I noticed a cigar or saucer shaped object, in flight, to the right of my house.   I did not notice this object while I was taking the picture.  It must have been completely silent.  I took 1 picture seconds before, and another seconds after, and the object cannot be seen in either.   The event must have only lasted for 1 to 2 seconds.;41.9265;-91.4342
