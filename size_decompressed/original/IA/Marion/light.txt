I saw the first object and thought maybe it's just an aircraft heading in for a final approach to the Airport. Than I realized it couldnt be an airplane because it was moving too slow. I though than that it could be a helecopter. But quickly realized it couldnt be one either. It would increase and decrease its altitude very rapidly. The object was A red light I couldnt see anything but that light it hovered around for a bit than I went inside to grab 2 of my friends. They thought it was wierd but they still dont believe me. after they saw the first object they went in side and thats when the second object flew past the first one. The second thing dissapeared thats when the first one dove down out of site. It waited there and than flew out of my field of Vision.;42.0441;-91.6006
Orange/white spheres seen by nurse and other neighbors  hovering;2014-10-18 23:00:00;2-5 minutes;orange/white spheres seen by nurse and other neighbors  hovering Person indicated seeing 4 lights in a diamond shape in the north east sky outside marion and ran to get camera due the lights being stationary and hearing no engine noise, when they came back out the orbs of light changed shape fast and disappeared faster than any aircraft heading towards the direction of nuclear power plant, they caught part of the them in a photo.  Previous to that another object was seen streaking across the sky faster than any known  aircraft at a earlier date and just vanished, similar shape, but different colored lights. Have noticed more sightings in eastern iowa and near old airforce/army bases esepcially  near waverly from what i have been told, but alot of people have noticed them and the increase of aircraft flying without lights as well with the faint noise of rotors as well in areas where sightings are occurring often after they have been seen. Lot of activity it seems for just training missions as we are told.;42.0441;-91.6006
