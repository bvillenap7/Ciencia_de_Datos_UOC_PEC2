4 objects of flashing color over city of 30,000;2002-01-03 19:30:00;still happening now;4 objects of flashing color over city of 30,000 At 7:30 ish, I noticed 4 motionless sources of light, flashing red, blue, and white. The one craft I could see from my bedromm window, and am looking at as I type this, appears to be in the shape of a +, but this may be due to the window. It wasn't, and at this time, which is now 9:02, still hasn't moved from its spot. The other three reamined motionless too, but I cannot view them at this time. I did, however, witness one ascending to above my window's view, and I went outside, it is still there. I see the possibility would arise that, on a night when both Saturn and Uranus are visable, that some would say that these are planets. Well, there are two things wrong with that. 1: there are four objects, not two. 2: What planets flash blue and white, then occasionally red? Another issue could be Well, they're hellicopters. This town is a town of only 26,000 and the biggest city in a 50 miles area is only 100,000. Why would 4 helicopters be over a small town in Iowa, not moving one inch in nearing 3 hours? Nonthing of national importance is in this town, although an aerospace technology center and a nuclear powerplant, but let me remind you those are both nearly 50 miles away. My conclusions: They are unknown to me, I would LOVE to say alien, but I can't without reasonable doubt. ((NUFORC Note:  The first possibility that should be ruled out in this case would be twinkling stars.  The description above is not inconsistent with that possibility, we feel.  PD));42.0441;-91.6006
Marion sighting Info;2002-01-03 19:30:00;none;Marion sighting Info Just some info about the description of the area provided by the person who also posted for this date. The city of Marion has about the population described, and the largest city nearby, Cedar Rapids, is actually not as far away as described and as small. Cedar Rapids borders Marion and the whole metro area of Cedar Rapids/Marion/Hiawatha has around 200,000 people. The aerospace center mentioned is Rockwell Collins, which builds radio and other equipment for military and civilian aviation is in Cedar Rapids, within 2 miles of the Marion border. The nuclear power plant mentioned is Duane Arnold Energy Center is in Palo, within 6 miles of Cedar Rapids northwestern border. So it is not as nearly far away as described by the person who posted about the flashing lights, and by the way is the only nuclear power plant in Iowa and does carry a lot of importance because of this.;42.0441;-91.6006
A strange short sirun noise with two massive jet streams of smoke in the sky in rainbow formation.;2007-04-23 00:00:00;2 Minutes;A strange short sirun noise with two massive jet streams of smoke in the sky in rainbow formation. As I was leaving a friends house i rolled down my window to hear a sirun like i have never heard before.  It was not a low or high pitch, very normal like a police but the closest i can explain is wo wo wah.  I called my brother who was near five miles from my location for him to say he thinks aliens are coming.  I than told him about the noise and he he also heard the same noise.  When I observed the sky as I stepped out of my car I noticed two arched white clouds, like what you would see from a jet but but they were near ten times the width of what is normal to see from my yard.  My brother had the same story and we were at two different places at the same time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.
