Distorted lights moving slowly at a high altitude then stopping for 20 to 30 sec. then slow orangish flash and their gone.;2004-09-22 23:30:00;2-3 mins.;Distorted lights moving slowly at a high altitude then stopping for 20 to 30 sec. then slow orangish flash and their gone. I had just gotten home from work and it was a clear night ,I live in the country so viewing the night sky is great.I had walked around to the back of the house and on my way back to the front I looked up and from the north there were what looked like two objects moving parallel to each other (may have been one object).The light they emitted looked like someone holding a flashlight and shaking it in their hand in a short back and forth motion,the light also looked distorted. The objects were moving at a speed I'd say was much slower than a satellite.The objects were by my estimates to be at a very high altitude.The objects moved directly over my location and continued on to the south a little ways, that is when they stopped and after about 20 to 30 seconds there was a slow orangish flash and they were gone.This is not like me to report something like this,but I thought I should share this incident.I work in a medical field and am also a pilot I've been married 23yrs.
