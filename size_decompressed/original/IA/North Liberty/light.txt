Three of us saw four bright white lights this evening.   They began from a central point, then moved in arcs and circles across the horizon.   The density of the lights changed from bright white to paler white, then changed from white to light green.   The speed at which they moved varied from super fast to slow as well.    The lights silhouetted the surrounding clouds, so that it was easily apparent that they were either in or above the cloud cover.   After about half an hour, a large red/blue orb appeared in the midst of the lights.    The lights were absorbed into the large red orb, which then streaked across the sky.;41.7441;-91.6132
