2 round, very large objects traveling at alarming speed through cloud ceiling.;2014-08-08 03:30:00;00:45;2 round, very large objects traveling at alarming speed through cloud ceiling The incident I am reporting occurred at approximately 0330 Hours CST while driving on Interstate 380 North about 2 miles after the North Liberty on-ramp.   It was cloudy and I saw two circles of light above the observable cloud ceiling (which is not uncommon given the CID airport is about 12 miles north).  The circles were right behind each other.   What caused me alarm was when the object protruded from the clouds and got closer.  They were dark and much larger, circular (sphere or disc-shaped, not certain) and had what looked most like a bright light-emitting apparatus on the underside.   It passed about 75 feet over me, moving SSE at a very high rate of speed.  The noise I heard it make was most similar to the noise sandpaper makes against wood, but louder.  I got home at around 5:00am yesterday,  I usually get home at around 4:00am, I chalked the tardiness up to me driving extra carefully because the road was damp, but the math just doesn't add up.  I want to know what happened on that road last night!   I drive this route 6 days a week to work from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, to Coralville, Iowa, and back.   No remarkable event have ever occurred minus seeing some drunk crash into shrubs three months ago.   I never thought I'd be on one of these sites reporting this but who knows?;41.7441;-91.6132
