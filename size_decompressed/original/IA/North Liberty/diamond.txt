Square, didn't move, low flying, solid.;2014-08-27 05:15:00;1 minute;Square, didn't move, low flying, solid. Saw hovering off of Scales Bend, while driving to work.  Thought it was a helicopter, but as I neared it, it was a solid square object with lights at all four corners.   It didn't move at all and had no search light.  Also, was fairly close to the tree line. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.7441;-91.6132
