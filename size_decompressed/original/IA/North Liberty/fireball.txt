Red/Orange fireball craft over North Liberty, IA.;2014-06-02 22:25:00;1 minute;Red/Orange fireball craft over North Liberty, IA. I saw what appeared to be a medium sized red/orange glowing ball shape moving low and silently in the sky, moving east over North Liberty, Iowa.  It was moving relatively slowly as well.  I witnessed this outside of my home window, while watching tv.  The object stayed in sight, for about a minute before it disappeared behind a tree line.  The object didn't have any flashing lights, that would indicate it as being a commercial or military flight.  I also reported the sighting to a local news station, but I haven't heard back from them.
