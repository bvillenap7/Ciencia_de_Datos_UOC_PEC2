I saw a UFO over a house, very close to roof.;1970-06-01 22:00:00;5 minutes;I saw a UFO over a house, very close to roof. My friend and I were coming home after going to a theater to watch a movie.  We both lived in the country and were on a country highway.  We were seniors in high school and it was 1970.   As we came up to a country home just off the highway both of us exclaimed what is that?  There was a UFO over the Sâ€™s house, very close to the roof and about the size of the house.   We pulled off the highway and watched it.  It slowly moved along side of us and just stayed there for about a minute.  It had a few colorful lights and had a sound, not very loud, that I could not identify.   I never heard the sound before.   We both looked at each other and then it started moving slowly past us along the route of the highway.   I yelled to follow it and my friend turned her car around and we sped trying to catch up to it.  Soon, it went very fast, maybe what they call warp speed and disappeared.   We only told my mother what we saw and this is the first time I am reporting this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));42.6954;-96.4874
