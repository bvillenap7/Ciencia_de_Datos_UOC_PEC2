BLUE/GREEN/WHITE Flashing Lights - cone shaped in the Northwestern Sky in Northern Iowa.;2012-05-08 22:30:00;10 minutes;BLUE/GREEN/WHITE Flashing Lights - cone shaped in the Northwestern Sky in Northern Iowa. In the northwest sky (around the constellation cygnus) from a distance I noticed flashing blue/green/white lights in the shape of a cone.  Lights were flashing in no particular order seemed randon as well as its movement.  Would stay still for a couple of minutes then it would make erratic movements up then sideways and etc.   I do have my pilot's license and do know what plane lights look like at night as well as their movement which prompted my curiousity in the first place because of its abnormal movements.  I live in a small town of about 7000 and lights are pretty dim at this time at night, in my case I was standing on my deck which faces east and I was looking northwest.;43.144;-93.3864
