My boyfriend and I were walking in from the garage when we noticed a very large light floating slowly over the barn. Now, the Cedar Rapids Airport was about 10 miles to the East, and at first I wanted to believe it was a plane, but it was silent. We were so scared we jumped into a bush as it passed overhead. It continued on across the field about a half a mile then made a 45 degree turn into the woods. We didn't see it again, but when we got inside and told his parents they mentioned seeing strange lights before also.;42.0394;-91.784
