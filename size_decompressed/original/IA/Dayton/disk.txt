bright star like lights seen through a telescope;2000-11-02 01:00:00;4-5hrs;bright star like lights seen through a telescope I recently was in dayton Iowa driving on dirt roads and noticed while I was parked some bright lights in the sky.Observing for a while I noticed they were moving,sometimes very eratically.They looked like a very bright star but there was a red beam that would be released every once in as while.In the beam there was other moving objects,and the more I looked around there was several of smaller things that were red above the tree line moving even faster than the big ones.I became very curious and went to a friends to set up a telescope.the people in the area have been seeing these things for a long time as have I for the last two years.Blowing them off thinking they are silent helicopters and satellites to bust meth labs in the troubled area.What I saw was not a helicopter.It was round with grooves in the bottom,some stationary lights,but also like bolts of lightning engulfing the form from the bottom of the ship.
