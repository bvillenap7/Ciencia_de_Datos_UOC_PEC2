Confusing light in North Iowa;2001-06-06 00:15:00;?;Confusing light in North Iowa I frequently sit and chat with a friend after work. Last night we were both admiring the clouds which were nicely highlighted by the moon. We eventually noticed an amber colored light just to the west of the moon. At first we thought it was a star, but instead of twinkeling it sort of pulsated, also it appeared to be infront of the main haze of the atmosphere but behind the lower clouds as there were absolutely no other stars viewable. It seemed to stay approxamately the same distance from the moon and gave the faint impression of rotation. Neither of us had any binoculars of course so we simply sat and watched it. With the moon highlighting the clouds it was apparent which ones were more dense and which clouds were very thin. This is important because the light would appear through some of the thicker clouds but would disappear behind a mere wisp of cloud. The light also caught our attention because it seemed to be about twice the size of a star, it didn't move as fast a a plane, and it gave the impression of being oblong ( wider to the front, or the western side than at the back, the eastern side). We saw it again tonight, same place,same time, same location in the sky but tonight (06/07/01) it doesn't seem to pulsate as much and also it gives a stronger impression of rotation.  I suppose there is probably a natural explanation for this but I simply can't think of one. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses may have been observing a celestial body, either Mars, or a bright star.  However, this is conjecture on our part.  PD));43.4135;-93.5311
