Bright double flash outside.;2017-12-17 01:35:00;2-3 seconds;Bright double flash outside At 1:35 in the morning the sky lit up like daylight in 2 flashes the first being the brightest.   I was inside a darkened room watching a DVD movie when this occurred, so I have no idea what was outside causing this phenomena.   I presumed it must have been a meteoric fireball, as the Geminids were just subsiding.;41.996638321168;-91.6659598540148
