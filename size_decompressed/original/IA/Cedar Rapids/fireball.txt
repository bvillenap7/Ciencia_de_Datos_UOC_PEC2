Tail disapated orange fireball continued. Long Green tail with a orange fireball moved across the sky from south to north in the eastern sky. Tail disapated, but the orange fireball continued in a northly direction. Fireball was engulfed in white smoke as it continued in a north downward direction. Note: looked to have left a black streak in the sky. Seemed to move very slowly. Took about 1 to 2 min from time witnessed, lost as it went behind a set of trees. It defentely did not come down close to my location.;41.996638321168;-91.6659598540148

A ball of blue and green flashing light, coming in very fast,VERY close to us and very big. fireball or meteor piece (??) appeared to be just that...  It made no noise.   At first, in our position we all thought it was gonna land or crash close until it changed course and flew off?;41.996638321168;-91.6659598540148

From an upstairs window, I observed an orange crescent shaped object flying toward my home.  I hollered for my wife who was in another room as I thought it might be a plane on fire.  I ran downstairs and on to our driveway as the object was approaching and passing directly over my house at about 1000 feet or so. (estimate)  The object was a fairly large glowing orange fireball with what appeared a hot white core.  It was not like any flame or fire I have ever seen before. It did not produce any smoke or emissions that I could see--the fireball was completely silent.  It was on a straight trajectory at a consisent speed of approximatley 15 mph---it appeared the flame was propelling its movement--I could no detect any mechanical structure around the flame---it was a clear, calm, starry night, and the flame emitted a rectangular shaped lit area around the top of it with what appeared some type of heat waves around the flame which were lit up againts the black sky! ---the fire was from three to ten feet in size...my wife also saw this fire from the window--she is from China and says she has never seen anythihng like it--that makes two of us.  I am very familiar with aviation, astronomy, meteors, and as a broadcaster and journalist for 25 years, I  am a keen observer.  This was not a Chinese lantern, a plane, a flare, a meteor, a hot air ballon, lightning, or a piece of debris.  I have seen similar descriptions on this website.  Please feel free to contact me to learn more.  I'd like to learn more and find some answers. Thank you!;41.996638321168;-91.6659598540148
