It could have not possbibly been an aircraft of this earth so instead of heading home I took a right and proceeding to follow it. I followed it for about 40 seconds to a minute before it took a path downard and then  postioned itself to where the pointed part of the teardrop was facing at a 45 degree angel and just zoomed by a an incredible speed, and then dissapeared. Neeless to say I was amazed and not scared at all.  This is my 5 ufo encounter, but first to be put online, and I'm an amateur ufologist, and this really blew my mind away.;41.996638321168;-91.6659598540148
Two objects iin the sky above Cedar Rapids Iowa morning of 3/5/09;2009-03-05 06:45:00;pic;Two objects iin the sky above Cedar Rapids Iowa morning of 3/5/09 Looking at some sunrise pics I took 2 days previous. Shots taken with my Kodak Z650 in Benton County looking East. Picture taken 24 seconds after the 1st has two very small objects in the south eastern sky that are NOT in the 1st. Cannot find these dots in any other photos on that disk. I will send both photos not retouched, just downsized a bit file size was very large. I DID crop and enhance the area that has the objects I'll send that also. Don't think the Eastern Iowa Airport lets aircraft fly that close!;41.996638321168;-91.6659598540148
