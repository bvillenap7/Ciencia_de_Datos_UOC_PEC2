Formation of five shiny metallic ovals;2003-04-14 16:00:00;3 min;Formation of five shiny metallic ovals Five shiny metallic ovals in tight formation moving north to south over downtown Cedar Rapids. Ovals would switch and trade positions with one another while maintaining a tight formation. I would guess that they were at a couple thousand feet in altitude.;41.996638321168;-91.6659598540148
The following is the result of an investigation by 3Iowa MUFON investigators into a sighting of 5 oval/disc shaped objects on April 14,;2003-04-14 16:00:00;3 minutes;The following is the result of an investigation by 3Iowa MUFON investigators into a sighting of 5 oval/disc shaped objects on April 14, 2003, at 4:00 p.m. over downtown Cedar Rapids, Iowa, reported to NUFORC as follows: 4/15/2003 9:08:04 AM 09:08.  All three investigators were impressed with this 50-year old witness' willingness to be as objective as possible in his quietly thoughtful assessment of his sighting.   He had taken a short break from his office and was sitting on a bench at 2nd Street & 3rd Avenue in Cedar Rapids wearing ray-blocker sunglasses when he sighted what he at first thought was a flock of birds.  However, as the formation approached to nearly overhead (moving from north to south) he realized that he was seeing at least 5 shiny metallic objects (no further apart in the formation than their own diameter), and to his amazement he saw that the objects constantly switched positions as the tight S formation rather slowly moved south at an estimated 30-50 mph INTO/AGAINST the wind. (It should be noted  here that weather conditions were as follows: Clear 87 degrees Fahrenheit visibility 10 miles WIND OUT OF SSW AT 26 mph, GUSTING TO 35 mph)  With 5 objects moving against such a strong wind, it seems reasonable to rule out balloons as an explanation for what this witness saw.  Witness estimates that objects were perhaps at around 2,000 feet when first sighted, but that they may have elevated somewhat as they drew closer to overhead.  (Whether this perception is accurate, of course, is not known.)  Witness observed a military jet a couple of miles away heading in the opposite direction as the formation, but it is not known if that pilot was aware of the formation.  Local police and sheriff's departments received no reports, and the FAA had nothing on radar.  This, of course, remains an anecdotal, one-person account, but Iowa MUFON investigators are impressed with this individual's careful attention to detail as he sought to satisfy his curiosity over what he was seeing.

Shiny oval objects no wings and no sound;2012-09-18 07:30:00;10 minutes;Shiny oval objects no wings and no sound At 7:25 am I was looking out my kitchen window to the Southeast and saw an object moving pretty fast and did not look like an airplane, so I stepped outside to get a better view and had my daughter and son with me we could clearly see if was not a plane, oval shaped, no sound, fairly big, my son pulled out his smart phone and taped it.  Went back inside, then at 7:30 or so another one from same direction came in, I went to grab my camera and snapped some pics, but they didn't turn out that well. My son thinks maybe it was a blimp so I called the airport and asked it they knew of any blimps, and they didn't, and didn't know what it could be.;41.996638321168;-91.6659598540148
I had just gotten off my computer giving a testimony in the name of jesus christ, to someone who needed it was on the wrong path.;2012-11-03 20:00:00;20;I had just gotten off my computer giving a testimony in the name of jesus christ, to someone who needed it was on the wrong path.  I went got in my car and two objects were hoovering in the sky on top of my car they followed me from my house down to walmart on edgewood road, then to the guppys on the go on edgewood,   I rolled down my window to make sure i was not seeing things, i wasnt they were hoovering high but directly over my car they were moving fast they were yellow light balls, moving fast and almost blinking, hovering over my car, moving so fast I knew they were following me. i was very scared i got back in my car and i went to the caseys on collins they followed me there, then i kept driving and they eventually disappeared.  I then wen home to call my father and i felt as though they were hovering over my house although i did not see them..... My phone was rejecting calls to my father which my dad has never nor never wold restrict my calls, there was t! remendous scrambling on the phone.  It rejected my phone call to him about 9 times. then i woudl get phone calls and i would answer and it would be all scrambly. I KNOW FOR A FACT WHATEVER I SEEN WAS DOIGN THIS.   I did eventually call my dad on that phone and he was no longer rejecting my phone calls. It seemed as though it was something different every time one time it would be rejected and another time it was no longer in service, which my father has an answering machine.  I truly believe  whatever i seen was of a demonic force and was very upset to my testimony of Jesus Christ.  I do know in the book of ezikel there are these objects seen by him as well.  I am not sure if this was demonic or of something of that manner. I know i seen what i saw i always thought ufos were fake.  THEY INDEED ARE NOT.  i believe whatever it is can watch things. this happened after a testimony on facebook and rember about my phone line. whatever they are have the power of technology.;41.996638321168;-91.6659598540148
