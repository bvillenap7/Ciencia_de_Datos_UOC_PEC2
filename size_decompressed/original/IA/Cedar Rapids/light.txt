Two faint non-blinking lights traveling at high speed intersecting path of an aircraft (with the standard blinking lights);2004-04-13 05:00:00;10 seconds;Two faint non-blinking lights traveling at high speed intersecting path of an aircraft (with the standard blinking lights) I was watching an aircraft going over, directly above me, from East to West. The aircraft had the standard blinking lights. Suddenly, I saw a faint light, mostly round as far as I could see, that was NOT blinking, go almost perpendicular, from North to South, crossing the path of the aircraft, directly over me.  The faint light was moving at a very fast speed in comparison to the aircraft. I was saying, wow! to myself, wondering what the heck it was.  And then, within a few seconds, a second light followed, on the exact same N to S path of the first light, also NOT blinking.  The first light seemed to intersect the path of the aircraft directly above me.  The second light was behind the aircraft with the blinking lights.  I tried to see if I could see the lights further south from my position, to see if they were continuing on the same N to S path, but just about the time the second light went by, my porch light went on (it's on a motion sensor), and I was blinded from seeing their trajectory after the initial sighting.  The first light had given me that wow! feeling, like the goosebumps type of thing, but when I saw the second light go by, it was a big WOW!, and I probably woke my neighbors!  I was outside with my two dogs when this happened. I can not explain those two lights, but I am wondering if the pilot(s) of the aircraft had seen it, since it appeared the first light would have been directly above them.;41.996638321168;-91.6659598540148
Two bright lights with about four or five smaller lights scattered near it dissapeared after being seen for around 8 seconds;2008-04-25 23:51:00;8 minutes;Two bright lights with about four or five smaller lights scattered near it dissapeared after being seen for around 8 seconds Two bright lights with a four or five smaller lights scattered around them were seen sitting stationary in the sky for about 8 seconds. The weather was very cloudy stars and the moon were not visible.  But the lights lit up very dimly the clouds near it. No movement, or strobe lights, but then the lights just disappeared like they had just been shut off. Stayed outside looking for about five minutes in the direction that the lights had disappeared but there was no sign of any lights again. Went back outside about every minute and still saw no sign of lights anywhere in the sky.;41.996638321168;-91.6659598540148
Red light dimming in and out across the clear night sky.;2008-10-25 22:30:00;2 minutes;Red light dimming in and out across the clear night sky. The object I saw was a red light dimming in and out it was moving fast and there was no green or white lights like a airplane usually has.  It had a very high altitude I would say about the same height as a commercial jet.  At the time seen the night sky was very clear with only stars in the backgroud no clouds at time seen. However there were two other aircraft in the area.  One had to be a airliner or jet I could hear that and it was far behind the red light moving at about half the speed of the red light.  The other aircraft I would say was a Cessna type craft, because of the engine I knew this and its altitude was lower than the other two.  Proably on approach to the small Marion airport (mainly for crop dusters).  The two knowns had the navi lights on so I knew they were known plus the noises they make to tell the difference.  I had seen falling stars around 21:00 looking straight up moving to the west and came back outside around 22:30 so I was keeping my eyes on the sky, I saw the brightest one I've ever seen at that time falling to the east this time so I stayed outside to watch the show looking east when the red unknown caught my attention.  It could not of been a sattelite to low an orbit. Then what I hope was a Common Barn Owl schreeched at me several times and scared me back in the house.  I smoke cigarettes outside only and is the reason I go out side so often.;41.996638321168;-91.6659598540148
Two very bright white lights come close together in the northwest sky and one dissapears...;2010-01-04 19:10:00;15 min;Two very bright white lights come close together in the northwest sky and one dissapears... I saw something strange tonight when I left the Marion construction office where I was working this evening at 7pm.  I drove south on 11st Street and headed out on East Post Rd to turn east on 30th St.  That’s when I saw two very bright white lights in the northwest sky one positioned not far above the other.  At first glance I thought they were stars or perhaps a plane and a star, but then I realized they were both positioned unusually low in the sky. The top light appeared to ‘dart’ in its movement.  As I drove into more darkness I could see what looked like a faint beam pointing down to the lower, more southern light.  Then it appeared the top light began moving up and away from the bottom light, and at the same time it’s bright white light changed to numerous red lights (like the underneath of plane.) Within seconds these lights were totally gone from sight!!  Only the bottom bright light remained and it was moving very slowly as if it was floating alon! g.  As I continued to drive eastward this light grew dimmer and dimmer and within about 5 minutes it appeared to be in one place now, with no movement.  About 10 minutes past as I pulled into my driveway (I live on a hill) I took a last look into the northwest sky and could see the dim light appearing to remain static.  I am really wondering what the heck this was.;41.996638321168;-91.6659598540148
My girlfriend and I just happened to be outside at approximately 9:45pm. We witnessed a bright white light move slowly from the NW sky,;2012-04-24 21:45:00;7 minutes;My girlfriend and I just happened to be outside at approximately 9:45pm.  We witnessed a bright white light move slowly from the NW sky, near the vicinity of the Moon's location,  to the E sky and fade to a dull brownish orange and disappear over our residence in Cedar Rapids, IA.  This object did not have any blinking lights associated with commercial aircraft.  he light's intensity was about that of the planet Venus.  Neither of us ever witnessed anything like this before.

Dancing BRIGHT BRIGHT white orbs in the night sky.;2012-06-03 03:00:00;5-6 minutes;Dancing BRIGHT BRIGHT white orbs in the night sky. I was sitting outside having a smoke looking at the stars around 3 am. One star or what i thought was a star started to move across the sky not in a straight line just casual roaming around the sky. I was sitting there staring at it when it got big and white then in an instant there was 5-6 BRIGHT BRIGHT huge white orbs just dancing across the night sky. I freaked out and ran inside to wake up my wife and get the cameras and ran back outside to see them still dancing all over the sky. i tried to use the camera on my phone to take pics but it was to dark. so i grabbed my wifes camera smart phone and yet it was still to dark to pick them up so i grabbed my digital camera and still couldnt get them. the orbs when the moved did not streak they would be as bright as any other star then get really big bright white then vanish and reappear dance around get really bright and vanish and reappear across the sky. there was no lights on them the way they moved like danc! ing around the stars. but the weirdest thing is the amount of distance they would blink, vanish what ever you want to call it, travel across the sky and then zig zag all over the sky.  My wife got to see the last two as i tried to tape it on my digital one flashed really bright white over the house then the other stayed the size of the other stars and zig zagged all over back and forth slowly working its way south, then they all just disappeared. we stood out in the yard looking at the sky for 15 more mins and they never came back. they emitted no other color but white they would start off the size of a star just zooming around the sky then they would get much much larger than any of the stars vanish and the reappear across the sky. I know it wasnt a airplane because you could see the planes flashing small tiny lights in the sky. it was almost fluid the way they moved across the sky. Im telling you they used up the whole sky zipping around oh they started from the north and ! were going south.

Astonishing Sound and Changing Lights Seen North Of Cedar rapids, Iowa on December 20th 3:15 A.M. +;2012-12-20 03:15:00;20 minutes;Astonishing Sound and Changing Lights Seen North Of Cedar rapids, Iowa on December 20th 3:15 A.M. + Awakened by loud hum.  Hum lasted about 5 seconds.  Hum immediately followed by a blue light which lit the entire horizon this light then immediately followed by a green light which also lit the entire horizon.   Lights were NOT a flash radiating outward but were almost like enormous bars of light (horizon to horizon) radiating upward toward the heavens.  This process was repeated at least 5 times and, we believe more as we heard it and could see our room lit from without before rising to look out the window - we personally witnessed at least 5 cycles. ((NUFORC Note:  Following an online new article about this event, published by a newspaper in Cedar Rapids on December 20, 2012, NUFORC received a number of reports from other witnesses.

5 bright orange lights moving together, hovering, then disappearing quickly - no sound.;2013-01-06 18:35:00;~10 minutes;5 bright orange lights moving together, hovering, then disappearing quickly - no sound Date:  January 6, 2013  Place:Linn County, Iowa (1 mile west of Blairsferry Rd/Edgewood Road intersection - Cedar Rapids/Hiawatha)  Time:	approximately 6:35 PM  Observation:   I saw a group of five bright orange objects north-northeast of my location moving in southerly direction.  The distance to the objects was hard to judge but I would guess they were about one to one and one-half miles away.  At first, I only saw one object (which is what caught my eye) and I thought it was our local air ambulance.  That gives an idea of the elevation and speed of the object, not particularly fast or high above the ground.  I then saw the other four objects.  All five were moving together but not in formation.  Their position changed relative to each other, but they were grouped fairly close to each other (visually, never more than probably five degrees apart).   I called my wife to the room to show her what I was seeing.  We went out to our deck.  By this time the object had quit moving.  There was no sound that we could hear.   We observed them for several minutes.  Since we were observing them through the limbs of a pine tree, we went back in th! e house and I went out through the front garage door and into the drive to get an unobstructed view.  It took me only about 45 seconds to get to the driveway and by the time I got there the objects had completely disappeared.  No sign in any direction.  So the objects had obviously disappeared very quickly. I am a biology and earth science teacher and have spent a considerable amount of time observing the nighttime sky and I have never observed anything remotely like this.;41.996638321168;-91.6659598540148
Two lights from space circling and dancing around each other as if playing.;2013-04-28 23:30:00;7-10 seconds;Two lights from space circling and dancing around each other as if playing. Two lights what at first looked like shooting stars in parallel, yet not in unison, suddenly stopped before striking Earth, and began to circle and &quotdance&quot around each other at incredible speeds. They almost appeared to be playing, like the way I have observed birds do at times. This continued for around 7 to 10 seconds and they streaked southward and disappeared.  They left a trail like a shooting star at first as they entered the atmosphere, yet there was no trail when they were &quotplaying&quot.;41.996638321168;-91.6659598540148

It took about 20-30 seconds to travel across the entire sky as far as I could see south to north.   Saw many planes tonight and this was not one!  I'm confident what I saw was a UFO.

Thought it was a helicopter at first then it started moving irradically and changing colors.  Red, blue, green, then a really bright silvery white.   Thought it could be a remote toy bigger than that thought and then started flying further away.   It was 14 degrees outside so I don't see how anyone would be playing with something.

Two separate, red circular lights seen after July 4th fireworks over Cedar Rapids;2015-07-04 22:30:00;20 seconds;Two separate, red circular lights seen after July 4th fireworks over Cedar Rapids I am a college graduate, in the dental profession, and a UFO skeptic.  (Until I had this experience and went online to research where to report it, I had no idea that there have been so many UFO sightings, especially on the 4th of July of each year.)    After watching the city fireworks from our back balcony, I noticed a bright red, round light floating from east to west,across the southern sky.  It had no sound, and at first I wondered if I was seeing a satellite.   But it was a bright red, bigger and brighter light than a satellite, and it looked to be be much closer.  Its light intensity seemed to get a bit brighter and dimmer alternately, but still remained a bright red.  It looked like it was at the altitude that a low-flying plane would be coming in to land, but it floated levelly and had no small navigational red or white blinking lights on it, like planes do.  (We have planes frequently flying over our home, heading to the local airport for landings, and this appeared very different than those.)   As it passed by our house, it finally seemed to turn outward, (away from us and the earth), and it quickly just faded away and was gone. The whole incident took approximately 15 seconds, but seemed much longer. As I was trying to make sense of what I had just witnessed, I noticed another red, round light to the left (east) of the first one, in the same area that we'd watched the fireworks just 10 minutes prior.  This red light was the same shape, color and intensity as the first one.  It hovered briefly rather high in the sky, then just descended, going straight down, towards land.  It went behind the treeline, whereby I couldn't see it any longer.   This whole incident also took approximately 15 seconds.  Like the first one, this light had no additional navigational lights like planes do.  It was silent, and seemed to have a smooth, floating quality to it. I was so baffled and almost flabbergasted by the sight of these two objects, that I did not even think to try to take a photograph.  I was in this kind of momentary time warp, where I was just awestruck by the whole experience--not really understanding or knowing for sure what I had actually just witnessed. I have never before witnessed this type of phenomenon, nor have I been a person who has an unusual interest or intrigue with UFO's.   Because it was late and my husband had already gone to bed, I had no other witnesses to this event.;41.996638321168;-91.6659598540148

In the early morning my wife and I watched an odd light in the SE sky above Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  We did call KCRG and asked if they could go and look at the light.  For over an hour we watched it change colors blinking white, blue, green and red.  Its movements were odd and erratic.  It would stay in one spot then either slow or fast suddenly shift directions jigging and jagging.  At one point it was making circular patterns in the sky.  It was just above the horizon: down and to the left of Orions belt.  KCRG asked if this may be a drone.  This was no drone I am aware of.  It was too far away, and lasted too long.

These satellites were appearing every 1-2 seconds.  I called my wife to see this. We must have seen 40 - 50 lights.  The lights then started appearing with a longer time gap between them.  We also saw another 10 - 15 lights emanating in the west sky and going the same direction.  The lights were not flashing and just looked like satellites.  This happened for probably 15 minutes.
