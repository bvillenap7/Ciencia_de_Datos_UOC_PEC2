A formation of three black winged objects very high up was sighted on a clear morning.;2002-06-18 07:45:00;1 minute;A formation of three black winged objects very high up was sighted on a clear morning. I heard a sound of jet like engines or rushing air briefly from overhead. I looked up with prescription sunglasses into the morning sky. I saw two black winged objects high up, soaring but with no wing flapping at all.  They were flying to the South West.  The interior side of the wings were curved inward.  I then saw a third object move closer in to join the other two just as one made a turn toward the South. They seemed too large for birds.  They slightly resembled the U-2 planes or maybe the B-2 Spirit bomber.  The wings were scalloped on the trailing edge and this was apparent even at the great distance.   I watched them for about a minute until they faded from view due to the high altitude.  The formation flight of the three widely seperated makes this remarkable.  The date is approximate within a few days.  I have watche high altitude birds fly such as Eagles and Condors and Buzzards but these were larger with more streamlined features.;41.996638321168;-91.6659598540148

The sky was very clear so I was looking at the stars etc. when I seen 6 to 8 circular objects in formation , no sound, no flashing lights, all a neon color moving from the north to south. I have limited view so they flew out of my sight. They were moving at a 100 mph clip from what I could tell.;41.996638321168;-91.6659598540148

Line of lights sitting over the cedar river;2020-10-14 23:11:00;2 minutes;Line of lights sitting over the cedar river I was driving and saw a line of lights floating in the sky. I pulled over to get my phone out to start recording a video so I can make out what is was. Then it started moving slowly and it went over my car and I couldn’t make out the shape all I saw was lights, a line of lights over the Cedar River. Each light would go in and out. It definitely wasn’t a plane or any craft I seen. Line of lights started moving when I started to record.;41.996638321168;-91.6659598540148
