Flattened cylinder with blue glow;2013-08-03 23:35:00;1 minute;Flattened cylinder with blue glow This is my report on a most recent sighting August 3, 2013 at approximately 11:35PM.  My location is north east Cedar Rapids Iowa, precisely 42° 01' 00 N by 91° 40' 30 W which is the surveyed location of my back yard astronomical observatory.  I am a retired electrical engineer working in the aerospace industry over 45 years.  I am 78 years old and my hobby is astronomy.  My observatory is a slide off roof type giving me a full view of the sky.   While preparing to mount a camera on my telescope for some deep sky photographs I observed an object moving slowly almost over head in a Northerly direction.  The object trailed a blue glow.  It did not have navigational lights and the only reason I could make out the shape had to be that it was low enough to catch the glow from the city lights south end east of my location.   The object was rectangular or perhaps a flattened cylinder. Definitely not a shape I associate with aeronautics.   While observing the blue glow intensified and the object disappeared over the northern horizon in perhaps 2 seconds.  My estimate of the speed was something like four to five thousand miles per hour, yet there was no sound. Over the past several years, I have seen different objects at various places in the sky but never paid much attention to them.  Only recently with the radio on in the observatory I became aware of other people reporting unusual events.   I hope this report is of some use and will keep and eye out for any other unusual aircraft. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

White wingless silent cylinder moved at constant speed without contrail along an apparent straight flight path.;2014-12-25 16:25:00;4 minutes;White wingless silent cylinder moved at constant speed without contrail along an apparent straight flight path. A white wingless cylinder with no contrail slowly and steadily flew along what appeared to be a straight flight path due west.  Due to the apparently straight path, it seemed to be slowly rising with respect to the ground - as opposed to normal planes which maintain altitude and therefore follow a curved path.  In addition, it became smaller and smaller as if it flew directly parallel to my vision. At the same time a jet liner with a contrail approached from the east.  The jet appeared to be higher altitude (I estimate 12,000 to 15,000) and I would estimate the cylinder to have been about 8,000 to 11,000 feet altitude.  The cylinder made no sound and continued along the straight path until it disappearing in the distance. Could have been a blimp but it seemed to be moving quite fast.;41.996638321168;-91.6659598540148
