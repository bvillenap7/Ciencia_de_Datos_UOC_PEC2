Power outage, flash of light and two soundless hovering craft;2007-02-06 23:45:00;30 minutes;Power outage, flash of light and two soundless hovering craft Woke up when power outage made CO detector beep.  Immediately a large flash of light from the sky and when it was off (about 2 seconds), the power came back.   10 minutes later noticed dozens emergency personel vehicles across field.  Called the cops and they said that there was an accident and I probably saw a transformer blow up (over a mile away).   Noticed two craft hovering around site emitting an amber color.  One started bobbing up and down and made a smooth pass about a half mile by my property.  Did not get a good look at it but could not hear a sound when I poked my head outside.   I then noticed the second one start making the same path and went out on the deck to get a look.  It had 3 spotlights on the side pointing to me and several red blinking lights on top and bottom.  It was closer than the last one and the wind was coming from its direction and still heard NO sound.  I have seen helicopters at night and this was not one.  It had no sound and I have never seen three horizontally aligned spotlights on the side of any aircraft before.    Will be a long night getting to sleep now.;41.996638321168;-91.6659598540148
