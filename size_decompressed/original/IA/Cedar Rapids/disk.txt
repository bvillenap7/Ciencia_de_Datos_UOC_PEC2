Half-circle mooon shaped object with 5 brownish-oragneish colored lights on the bottom.;2005-03-28 21:15:00;1.5 minutes;Half-circle mooon shaped object with 5 brownish-oragneish colored lights on the bottom. Me and my best friend(we're both 13) were in my back yard, just hanging out listening to music. My friend took some stuff inside and I stayed outside under the blakcets, we had been laying on them looking at the sky talking for a while, a few seconds after he went inside I turned my view and something with 5 brownish-orangeish lights on the bottom of it. My first geuss was that it was a plane or helicopter, but i was like thats flying really low to be a plane and then I relized there wasn't really any sound, so I thought it couldn't be what I first thought it was. Then my friend came back out side and I asked whats that?, he didnt know what I was talking about so I pointed at it, he did ended up seeing it, we both only saw it for about 30 seconds before we lost sight of it behind some trees heading in a north-eastern direction, it was a half circle moon type thing shape. We aren't quite sure what it is, but we are sure its some kind of UFO.;41.996638321168;-91.6659598540148

Fast flying UFO.;2014-10-08 21:00:00;~1 minute;Fast flying UFO. 5 of us traveling in a vehicle, we saw what at first glance looked like 2 airplanes flying side by side, until we got a full view.  The aircraft had headlights like a vehicle but were very bright like high beam.   It was disk shaped with several red and some yellow or orange lights that were smaller along the side opposite the headlights.  We are hoping someone else will report this or find out what that was we saw! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  Possible hoax?
