UFO over Cedar Rapids;2010-09-25 03:00:00;2-3 minutes;UFO over Cedar Rapids I saw a light going across the sky going the direction of Iowa city, was moving very fast, couldn't have been a satellite as it was travelling, and did not go in a perfectly straight line, passed past a few stars, as well as passed behind clouds, was able to keep my eye on it for about 3 minutes.  No blinking lights, just solid glowing. I feel pretty confident that this was no airplane or helicopter or rocket.;41.996638321168;-91.6659598540148
Strange Lights Across Cedar Rapids, Iowa Sky on June 2, 2012 @ around 9:15 pm CST;2012-06-02 21:00:00;4-5 minutes;Strange Lights Across Cedar Rapids, Iowa Sky on June 2, 2012 @ around 9:15 pm CST At around 9:15 pm CST (dusk), my neighbors and I witnessed a succession of about 12-15 bright, non-blinking large red lights, floating low on the horizon, across the clear, Cedar Rapids, Iowa sky following a NW to SE direction.  First we saw three of the lights in a triangular formation, then a bunch more came in random spacing.  This lasted for about 5 minutes, then one-by-one, they faded off the horizon.  These WERE NOT aircraft or meteors (no sound), so what were these objects?  I don't think they were satellites, since they were too low in atmosphere, too large, too many grouped together, and red in color instead of bright white.  I called the local KCRG TV9 newsline shortly after this event, and they said they received other calls about these lighted objects.  What was it?  I tried to get a video, but my camera batteries were dead!;41.996638321168;-91.6659598540148

It was traveling north to south and stopped and started going the other way, then 2 smaller round objects appeared and started darting around the bigger object, going away and coming back towards it. the 2 smaller ones would disappear and reappear.  Then the smaller ones disappeared and about 1 min. later the big one went straight up and was gone.;41.996638321168;-91.6659598540148

Saw two lights that looked like shooting stars.  I asked the person I was with if they were and they said no, they would have been gone by now.  One light was going faster than the other like they were connecting.  They didn't have flashing lights like airplanes do.  They also were not very high in the sky.  The lights were traveling very slow compared to an airplane or a shooting star.;41.996638321168;-91.6659598540148

Bright orange lights moving from NW to SE very slowly;2015-08-16 23:00:00;12 minutes;Bright orange lights moving from NW to SE very slowly At 23:00 last night I was sitting on our deck looking at the stars when I noticed a very bright orange light, at approximately 12: oâ€™clock position in the northern sky, moving slowly from NW to SE.  Upon looking at this through binoculars it appeared to be a cluster of smaller orange lights, but very intense. I also asked my son to look at this and using binoculars he verified seeing the same thing.   As we watched it changed direction and headed more directly SE, over Cedar Rapids.  A side view appeared to have the orange lights in the front and smaller white trailing lights along the bottom.    It moved out of view and then disappeared.;41.996638321168;-91.6659598540148
