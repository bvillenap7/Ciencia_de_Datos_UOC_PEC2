Lights ;1999-09-15 23:30:00;15 minutes;Looking west, at about 20-30 degrees up from the horizon, saw strange light that appeared to be moving very slowly or hovering. Lights did not look like aircraft through binoculars. Had horizontal line of white lights, distinguishable through binoculars, and red lights above and below white row of lights, that seemed to throb brighter and dimmer, not blinking totally on and off. Watched the light in relation to other aircraft moving by, which by the way, seemed to be much more air traffic in that direction than usual. Looking west, at about 20-30 degrees up from the horizon, saw strange light that appeared to be moving very slowly or hovering. Lights did not look like aircraft through binoculars. Had horizontal line of white lights, distinguishable through binoculars, and red lights above and below white row of lights, that seemed to throb brighter and dimmer, not blinking totally on and off. Watched the light in relation to other aircraft moving by. And, by the way, there seemed to be much more air traffic in that direction than usual. The night sky was very clear.  No clouds seen.  The object was barely distinguishable with out the assistance of binoculars for me, but my wife who is farsighted, could see without binoculars. I would say that it could have been a large plane going away from us, except that the event took about 6 to 7 minutes. The object moved from about 30 degrees up from the horizon down to the tree level and out of sight, which would be about 10 degrees above the horizon. The object, if moving away from us, would have been going east to west. However, over the 6 to 7 minutes, the object didn't move far, and it didn't appear to grow smaller as it would have had it been moving away. Also, I did not notice in colored lights on what would be the wing tips if looking at an aircraft from behind. One more thing about the object. we had been looking straight up and out toward the west for 5 to 10 minutes prior to it's arrival. It was suddenly there, and we had not seen it what so ever before our first visual sighting of it. Both my wife and I had been scanning the sky as we do almost nightly over the last two months. The other air traffic over our area, while looking west from the front of our house, was very heavy in the western sky.  One aircraft went over us from West to East, fairly low.  It also didn't appear to resemble what we typically see when regular airline passenger jets go over. It was also fairly quiet. Could have been military, but I can not verify that. Tonight has not been the first night we have seen unusual events in the sky.  In august, (I know it was a Sunday evening, and I believe it was 8/13/99) during the meteor storm, we happened to see the very, VERY bright light in the west sky. It lasted long enough that my wife saw it first and said look at that - I saw the tail end of it, and it seemed to last for a good second or two. There was NO TAIL. It came, out of nowhere, without a tail like other falling stars, according to my wife. I have never seen a falling star like that before. We have also seen a very dimly lit light going quickly across the sky, from NW to SE, directly overhead. About the size of a star. Round, no blinking lights. Looked like a headlight in fog, or a flashlight shining through a sheet of white paper. Small, even with binoculars. Since I didn't write down the dates and times or report those incidents, I won't submit seperate reports for those incidents. However, I wanted to include this information, as my wife and I feel like many things are happening that don't quite fit the norm, and it is the reason why I took the time to write about the event we saw tonight so that it can be recorded... just in case... and so I can remember the date and time (I lose track of time more and more)... You can contact me if you want to. I will let that be your decision. I am not checking the box below that I want to be contacted.;41.996638321168;-91.6659598540148
Sun shining off of geometric shape, hovering still, over Cedar River in C.R.;2007-06-15 13:00:00;5 minutes;sun shining off of geometric shape, hovering still, over Cedar River in C.R. I don't remember the date, or year, but it was a nice clear sunny day several years back.  I was traveling east on the bridge over the 5 and 1 dam, and was stopped at the 1st stop light on the viaduct, which goes over the Cedar River, under interstate I-380, for a red light.  I looked over towards the Quaker Oats factory, and I saw something over the river, with the sun hitting it, and glinting off of the surface, which had to be metal, because of the bright reflection of sunlight bouncing off of it.  The light obscured the exact shape of the object, but I assumed it had some type of flat surfaces, although it appeared to be in a round or oval general shape, because at first I thought it was a balloon.  But the way the sun reflected off of it, and the fact that the glinting moved slightly-like the object tilted here and there, slightly, while staying in the same place, led me to believe it had some angular sides, culminating in a geometrical round or oval s! hape.  I knew it was not a balloon, because it stayed in the exact same place, and the only movement was this slight tilting around that I only knew of because of the sun glint moving around like off of flat surfaces that are tilting around randomly, but only slightly.   It may have been several hundred feet or more, away from me, and several hundred feet or more, above the river.  It was not a balloon, plane, or helicopter.  I looked around to see if any other drivers saw it, but they were looking straight ahead, when the shape was off to our left, plus I think the interstate overpass above us blocked their view, but I could see it because I was on the left hand side in the left lane (a one-way).  When the light changed, I circled around the 1st chance I got, but the shape was gone.  It seems similar to the post where someone saw something on 4-17-2008, because of the reflection, and that it was staying in one spot.  My mind could not and can not make sense of what it was, as I have never seen anything like it before of after. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Lights on southern horizon;2012-12-21 02:15:00;A while;Lights on southern horizon My friend and I were driving home and saw about 10 beams of light on the southern horizon.  They were in uniform intervals across the entire horizon for miles.  The beams were purplish, blue. We watched for about 10 minutes, then I was scared so I went inside.  Straight beams of light but didn't change color.;41.996638321168;-91.6659598540148
Red-orange light over Cedar Rapids, Iowa, under partly cloudy sky, moving from west to north.;2014-05-26 01:08:00;00:02;Red-orange light over Cedar Rapids, Iowa, under partly cloudy sky, moving from west to north This is a report of a UFO I witnessed within the last two hours.  I will begin with the time and local weather, then give the description. It is May 26, 2014.  Local time at the end of the event was 1:08 a.m., Central Daylight time.  It is Memorial Day weekend.  The location is a residential area in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. GPS position is 41° 59.461 N x 91° 41.162 W. People in the neighborhood had been outside earlier, but had all gone inside.  The night was quiet. Local weather reports indicate partly cloudy, with clouds at 6,000 to 10,000 feet, temperature 68 to 70°, wind speeds 1 to 4 MPH. My backyard view is limited by hillside and trees.  I could not feel any breeze or see any stars.   I saw a  red-orange light in the northwest, moving relatively slowly to its northeast.  It seemed to curve to a more northerly direction.  It looked about as low as a typical small airplane or helicopter, but there was no sound. I could not discern any features such as corners that would indicate shape, but it seemed to have perhaps 5 or 10% of the Moon's apparent diameter.  The intensity was steady.  It looked nearer and brighter than an overflying aircraft light, and the color was less intense red, with an orange hue.   I watched for maybe a minute or two and it grew dimmer as it moved away, then I lost sight of it. An hour and twenty minutes later there was a brief heavy rain shower. I am age 64, military veteran, work in a technical job, wear bifocals.  I can't think of any other detail.;41.996638321168;-91.6659598540148
Blue light, then followed by a bright flash, before disappearing.;2015-09-28 02:44:00;5 minutes;Blue light, then followed by a bright flash, before disappearing. 9/28/2015 2:44 AM Cedar Rapids Coming up the ramp off of Hwy 30 traveling west, as I came to the stop sign, noticed a blue light hovering  about 200 yards above the ground to the north of me.   I continued to watch it and pulled to the side of the road and could see that it was moving , but slowly.   I turned the car around and started towards it traveling on Bus 151 towards the intersection of Wiley Blvd SW.  The image seemed to be above the street named Cynthia St SW.  As I drove closer to the blue light, now within ¼ mile from it-I was starting to feel different- not so much scared but on edge, un-nerved perhaps.  The light then grew to a bright flash of light for 3-4 seconds, very bright like a football stadium light growing from the blue light now was a bright white.   It then disappeared and nothing could be seen.  I pulled over and watched and waited for any more to happen but that was it.;41.996638321168;-91.6659598540148

Witnessed (14) flying objects flying NW to SE over Cedar Rapids.  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-01-07 18:15:00;7 minutes;Witnessed (14) flying objects flying NW to SE over Cedar Rapids. The reason I am reporting is it was unusual to see 14 separate craft flying one after the other come into my purview and then disappear into what seemed like a black hole. I watched for a long period of time to see if they showed up again but they never did.;41.996638321168;-91.6659598540148
