spherical solid object bright white hovering high up in clear sky then moving slowly out of sight;2002-03-27 15:00:00;5 minutes;spherical solid object bright white hovering high up in clear sky then moving slowly out of sight It was a clear blue sky with one jet flying from NW to SE leaving a contrail.  As I looked up at the contrail from my outdoor work,  I noticed  a very bright object off to the right of the contrail at a due South location about 35 degrees up.  I could see that it was a solid white object gleaming in the bright sunlight.  It was not moving and was at very high altititude.  It varied slightly in its brilliance, as if wobbling slightly toward a duller surface.  I pointed it out to a co-worker who looked at it briefly.  I watched it off an on for 5 minutes.  Then it began to move slowly in a flat trajectory and after travelling the length of a finger held out faded away.  So it could not have been Venus and seems it could not have been a balloon as it remained steady for 5 minutes before leaving slowly. A brief sound of motors could be heard somewhat like a jet helicopter just before its movement but I can't be sure it came from that object.  I sure wanted binoculars at that point but only had a keen naked eye observation.  At times the edge of the extreme object seemed to have a slight reddish glow.;41.996638321168;-91.6659598540148
Objects flying in the same path with same speed and distance apart.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-28 20:20:00;15 minutes;Objects flying in the same path with same speed and distance apart At 20:20 on March 28th, 2020 my husband and I were outside looking at the moon. There is a bright star to the right of the moon. In between the moon and the star I started seeing objects flying between. At first I thought they were airplanes but it was one solid light, no flashing lights and I realised I was not an airplane. Then they started coming one after another seeming to be in the same exact path going the same speed and seemed all the same distance apart. I thought maybe it was a meteor shower but then I seen a shooting star and it was closer and it had a tail. It flew in a different direction as these objects.  I have seen meteor showers before and I've never seen them fly like this.  I called a relative and asked them to go outside to see it and they also seen it. It lasted for about 15 minutes while I was watching but then just suddenly stopped. Although I didnt count them exactly I would guess I seen about 15 all in a row.;41.996638321168;-91.6659598540148
