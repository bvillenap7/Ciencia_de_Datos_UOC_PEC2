I have never seen a UFO or anything resembling one before.   I was outside at about 10:15 pm CST and looked up to see a flashing light.  At first I thought it was a low-level airplane, but as I watched it (it was only one craft) it's behavior was extremely unusual.  The object flashed a white light approximately 6 or 7 times during the entire 10 or so seconds before flying off into the horizon.   It was moving very fast, about 3 times the speed of a normal aircraft.  It was heading nearly direct west at first, flashing twice, appearing to jump between each flash.  Then, it 'jumped' to a 90 degree angle south from the original flight path, blinking once again.  With each blink, it seemed to travel about the same distance.   It again, jumped and flashed direct west, then took another 90 degree angle jump to the north, where it flashed again, seemingly to resume it's original course.  I said do you see that? to my husband and the thing flashed again, still on the path headed direct west, then very quickly flashed a couple more times and took off toward the horizon until it was out of sight.;41.996638321168;-91.6659598540148
Boomerang/cresent crescent shape object absorbs dense white cloud in seconds in a blue sky;2014-09-07 23:31:00;1 minute;Boomerang/cresent crescent shape object absorbs dense white cloud in seconds in a blue sky I was laying on my hammock looking at a particular dense white cloud in a blue sky off in the distance when I noticed what appeared to be the light catching a boomerang or wing shaped object as it approached the upper top of the second most dense portion of the cloud.  I kept watching to see if it would come out the other side as the cloud was dense... but not that large.  Within less than a minute the upper half of the cloud which had been distinct from the lower half was just absorbed like water on a hot skillet, leaving no trace of the cloud at all while the bottom half/cloud remained the same.  I never saw the object come out and the sky was as clear and blue as it could ever be.  The object made no sound.  Though I may be somewhat off on the shape due to the sun which reflected off it made it appear metallic and boomerang or crescent moon shaped. My first thought is that the object absorbed the water.  I am in my 60's and never saw anything like it befo! re. I never even believed in UFOs other than what is here on earth which it still could have been.;41.996638321168;-91.6659598540148
