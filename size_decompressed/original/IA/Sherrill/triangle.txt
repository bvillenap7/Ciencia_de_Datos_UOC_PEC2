We were next her car kissing out of the corner of my eye I seen a very bright light it was moving quite slow bout 30 40 mph.  It got closer and I literally got this feeling that I started to freak out I was crying and felt like I should just run just pure fear I think.  When it got overhead it made no sound silent as hell which dumbfounded me I grew up in a military family and my dad was a green beret I have never seen anything like this.  It was a triangle complete even on all sides this thing was huge exactly the size of my neighbor’s house because it flew overhead.  It had 3 bright lights even on all sides.  I was so scared I woke up my dad and called the cops. Because it was a damn craft so low to the neighbor’s house I was like if the military is doing that next time I am shooting at them.  But they actually called air traffic control in which I kid you not about five minutes later the law enforcement left and military jets came flying by low and loud.  I spent most of my life trying to figure out what this was and why the cop couldn't tell us what was going on.  Apparently the cop never documented this. I knew that cop we live in a small enough town to know most people.  The officer ended up getting relocated.  I know what I saw that night and personally I am frightened.;42.6154;-90.8161
