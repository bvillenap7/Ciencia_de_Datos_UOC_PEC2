Orange oval light moving north then south;2016-09-08 01:00:00;5 minutes;Orange oval light moving north then south On the morning of September 8, 2016, between 12:30 and 1:00 am, I observed an orange light in the sky on the eastern edge of Centerville, Iowa. When I first noticed the light my first thought was it’s another small plane, but then I realized it didn’t have the normal lights of a plane, it was glowing orange. I could see it just above a line of tree tops, moving rather slowly to the north, until it disappeared behind taller trees. In about a minute, maybe less, it appeared again, moving back in the opposite direction. I watched until it again disappeared behind the trees. Its shape was almost oval, except that it was more flat on the bottom, and was raised on the top, which made me think it might have been a disc shaped craft. I couldn’t be sure how big it might have been since I had nothing to use as a reference, and I couldn’t be sure how far away it was, but it seemed to be rather low in the sky moving slowly and I thought maybe it was looking for something.  I sometimes see small planes this low, so I’m thinking it was about the size of one of those. It was a clear and calm night, and this thing kept the same speed in both directions.;40.7313;-92.8777
