I was looking over lake Rathbun it was beautiful, the sun was past the horizon and it made a nice golden glow, went to make a video of it for my girlfriend.  After making the video, I watched it, and I found that there were very strange noises on the video, none id ever heard before.   Not more than a few minutes later I happened to see a white orb in the sky.. moving closer and closer too me.  I went back to my car to grab my phone I had just put away to try and video tape it.  The object then moved from coming to me to past the moon, the moon was too bright for the object to be seen on my phones camera.   It's twice now I've seen this object.;40.7313;-92.8777
