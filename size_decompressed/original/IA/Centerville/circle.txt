Bright Circle of Light followed me from Oskaloosa IA to Centerville, IA.;1999-08-15 02:30:00;1 hour;Bright Circle of Light followed me from Oskaloosa, IA, to Centerville, IA.. I was on my way home from Pella, IA.  Driving to Centerville, IA.  Around the Oskaloosa, IA exit. I seen a bright white light.  It stayed with me until I reached Centerville, IA.  There is a water tower on the south east  side of town.  I stopped and the light stopped and it was between the ball on top of the water tower and the part that comes out of the ground.   I rolled down my window.  It made no noise the light didn’t move this was for about 4 minutes. .  I got scared and started to drive and the light went straight up into the sky and went back north. Back in the direction in which it followed me.   I wish I would have gotten out of my car and walked towards it.  I hope before I pass I am able to see it again or see another UFO.  I won’t be scared and I will try and get closer.  It is now 2019.;40.7313;-92.8777
