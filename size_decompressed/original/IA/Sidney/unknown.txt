I was walking with a couple of my friends just laughing talking and i just happened to look up.  It was a beautiful night.  My friends noticed me looking up.  There was an object silver object big probably about 12 to fifteen feet in a V shape with lights perfectly spaced apart along the bottom of it.  The color of the lights were some ive never seen before just very bright.  The craft hovered for a few seconds before it shot straight up in the air and was completely out of sight for as big as it was without a sound.  It was beautiful.;40.7539;-95.641
