Red/blue flashing disc in se sky. about 65 degrees   just sitting there.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius??  PD));2012-01-06 20:45:00;8:00=8:45;red/blue flashing disc in se sky. about 65 degrees   just sitting there. This is happening right now in the south east sky.  Looks like a bright star but flashes of red and blue colors.  Maybe a satellite?   On the telescope it is an exact round disc but no flashing when zoomed way in.  Not sure what it is but thought I would report it. I was  a satellite tech and would say it is at 65 degrees (direct tv is south at 101) look now if you can.;42.7067;-94.4108
