Witness soundless flickering lights moving NE in the clouds above.;2010-01-21 05:30:00;15 minutes;Witness soundless flickering lights moving NE in the clouds above. 01/21/10 Between 5:30 and 5:45 a.m. Warren County, IA Between Bevington and St. Charles  Overcast morning. Had ice storm yesterday. Saw flickering lights in the clouds between neighborsâ€™ houses.  Thought it was the maintainer scraping the roads and its lights were reflecting upon the clouds.  Continued with the chores.  Checked on my waterer and looked up and the flickering lights were floating in the clouds overhead.  Real smooth, no sounds.  Lights were mostly yellowish, like a soft white light bulb.  They flickered all over the place, but in a circular area. Could this be a new and improved weather balloon?
