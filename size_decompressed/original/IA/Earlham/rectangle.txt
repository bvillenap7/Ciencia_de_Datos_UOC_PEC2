The big ship made no noise, had metallic color and a few weird colored lights (3)or (4) we noticed them when they were about a mile away, 3 lights sporadically moving around.as we sat on the top of a limestone pile at a quarry 10 miles south of earlham iowa. The next thing we knew a huge ship was coming slowly right above us pretty slowly. we freaked out bad and tried to get off the big limestone hill we were on. As we tried to get out from being directly underneath this ship I noticed 2 pod like ships cruising at the treetop level about a few hundred yds away, slowly following the big ship or checking out the quarry. 2 friends ran to the car which was parked 200yds away. my friend and I paused to watch the big ship float over the lake once again, as the big ship started coming at us again, we had had enough fun at this point and ranfor the car. After we got on to the highway my 2 friends in the backseat said that it is coming after us, I drove probably 70-80 mph and noticed a increasingly bright fill my mirrors then disappear! needless to say I didnt sleep for days. we never have reported it till this day.;41.4723;-94.1338
