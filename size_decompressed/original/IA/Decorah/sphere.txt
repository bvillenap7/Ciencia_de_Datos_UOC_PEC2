I noticed an amber colored object off in the distance coming towards me and my mom.  The object appeared to be the size of a tennis ball.  It then changed direction and slowly but steadily headed north.  This lasted between 20-30 seconds.  There was no noise.;43.3265;-91.7953
Two amber colored orbs moving together.;2014-03-29 20:35:00;1 minute;Two amber colored orbs moving together. I was out getting a set of cows for milking and as I closed up the gate I saw the first amber orb coming out from behind the shed.  Shortly after another one appeared just slightly offset from the first but both of them were the same size and moving the same speed.  I watched it for over a minute when the first orb faded out and the second one shortly after.;43.3265;-91.7953
