Bright lighjt manuevers over Iowa sky.;2012-04-11 21:40:00;1 min;Bright lighjt manuevers over Iowa sky. Was outside looking at the stars when I see what appears to be a dim light traveling from South to North almost directly above, it begins to get brighter and brighter and I think cool a fireball (meteor), but to my amazement it suddenly took a turn to the Northwest sharper than a any convention aircraft turns. the light dimmed as it moved away.  There was no sound to this object siting. I feel it was other worldly.;42.3107;-92.6015
