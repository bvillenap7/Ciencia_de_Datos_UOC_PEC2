Erratic direction, light(s) faded and reappeared in Iowa.  ((Jupiter??));2004-08-12 23:30:00;about 30 minutes;Erratic direction, light(s) faded and reappeared in Iowa. As I stepped outside my house for a few minutes, I looked up at stars above.  Towards the west maybe around a 40 degree angle above the horizion, I saw at first what appeared as a star.  Then I noticed it moving back and forth (the lights would get brighter and dimmer) and side to side.  I knew it wasn't a star, and it could not be an aircraft because the side to side movement was fast enough not to match any aircraft speeds.  As I continued to watch, an airplane off in the distance kinda near it went by, which it then fadded so that i could no longer see it.  Then it reappeared after the airplane past by it.  It continued to move back and forth, and side to side, and I lost track of the lights as it went closer down to the horizon where the trees obstructed my vision.  The erratic movement and the fading of a single light, (possible more than one light) also the duration of 30 minutes of which I observed, is what lead me to truely beleive that it was an UFO. At times there was a little haze around the object, but because it was a distance from me, I couldn't always see it, but when it came the closest to me, I thought I may have seen more lights, possible blue and green. ((NUFORC Note:  The witness was looking in that area of sky where Jupiter can be found at that time of night on the date in question.  PD));42.3107;-92.6015
