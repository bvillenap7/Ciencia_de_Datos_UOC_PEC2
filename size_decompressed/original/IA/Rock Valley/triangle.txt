Two more went over in the next 10 minutes or so. I went inside the house to get my sister as a witness. After about 10 more minutes another one went over, passing from horizon to horizon in ablout 2-3 seconds. No sonic boom or sound was made. It was quite large, about 3 inches wide b/n fingers held at arm's length. Over the next 35 minutes about 6 more went over towards the East. All had a distinct triangle with three lights at the points. As  it went over, you could see stars diifused through the body of the craft which was very weird. It almost had a cloaking effect, something you would see on Star Trek. At about 2405 CST about 10-12 points of light went over in the Northern sky and halfway across the sky, they did a zigzag through weachother at tremendous speed. They were not meteors as they left no trail of debris or burn up. They went over the horizon and that was it. Reported this all to MUFON in Oct 95. Primary observer: former Marine, law enforcement major in college Secondary: college graduate, business major lights: all white;43.201;-96.3097
