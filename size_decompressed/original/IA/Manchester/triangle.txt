One red light at the face of the triangle and two white lights in the back. Fairly large triangle shaped craft of some sort hovering in place for around ten minutes about a kilometer from my house.  It only had two white lights in the back and one red light at the front, which was pointed in my direction.  I pulled my phone from my pocket and aimed the camera at it and while it was a pretty clear night, it would not come up on my camera.  Needless to say it's left me a little spooked because I just sort of humored the idea before this experience.  It was also completely silent.  Also, earlier, my vehicle's battery was acting a little funny. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.4861;-91.4452
