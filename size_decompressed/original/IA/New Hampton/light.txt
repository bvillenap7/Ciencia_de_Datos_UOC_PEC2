2 HUGE BRIGHT STATIONARY LIGHTS IN THE SKY.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus and Jupiter currently are prominent in the sw sky.  PD));2008-11-25 18:30:00;15 minutes;2 HUGE BRIGHT STATIONARY LIGHTS IN THE SKY I was driving to the west on a gravel road around 6:30 pm, and noticed 2 VERY HUGE and bright lights (nothing blinking) in the SW sky. (abnormally larger and brighter than stars)  It was a very clear night and many stars were visible.  Also noticed a few aircraft (lights blinking) in the skies.  These 2 bright lights were obviously not moving like normal aircraft, but in a stationary position.  Could see aircraft (lights blinking) flying around these 2 bright lights for about 15 minutes like they were keeping their eye on them. Towards the end of the observation, noticed the lights seemed to be more in the distant than before, but still NOT moving.  Said loudly, this WAS NOT AN AIRPLANE, NOT A HELICOPTER, but had a weird sense that this was something abnormal. ((NUFORC Note:  Venus and Jupiter currently are prominent in the sw sky.
