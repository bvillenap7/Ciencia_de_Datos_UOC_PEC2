Large ball of light sighted above rooftops.;2012-08-06 22:30:00;seconds;Large ball of light sighted above rooftops. On August 6, 2012, at around 2:00 in the afternoon I saw a large helicopter flying low towards our airport on the south side of town. My ex-husband is a United States Marine and is a helicopter engine mechanic. We lived on Camp Pendleton in California for over two years. I recognized the helicopter as a CH-46. I was surprised, because I live in a very small farming community and we don’t have any military bases nearby. We only have about 3,000 residents and it struck me as odd that a helicopter of that size was here. Around 10:30 later that night I was walking home with my family from a friend’s  when I saw something strange above our house. It was a bright yellow-orange ball of light with an aura surrounding it. I only saw it for a few seconds, and then it was gone. It didn’t look or move like a shooting star, a meteor or a plane. I’ve never seen anything like this before. It seemed to be only hundreds of feet from our rooftop, instead of up with the stars and it was very bright. It traveled north to south, towards the horizon and was gone in the blink of an eye.;40.7309;-92.3954
