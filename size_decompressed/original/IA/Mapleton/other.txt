A stationary flashing object in the lower atmosphere;2003-07-04 02:30:00;00:15;A stationary flashing object in the lower atmosphere On the described date, I was attending a break at approx. 2:15 am. As i ws sitting in the lounge chair outside i looked in the sky and saw what i thought to be a star that was very twinkly so i moved to get a better perspective onyl to realize that the object was not a star. As i examined it further, i noticed that it appeared to be in the lower atmosphere. about 15-20 thousand feet in the sky at a distance of about 3-5 miles away, also, the object appeared to be stationary during the whole time i observed it. The object also had 5 distince colors of 2 reds which was in the middle and did not flash. Yellow which was at the bottom and flashed and appeared to be spinning beneath the reds. Green which spinning on top of the reds and also flashing. Blue which flashed very quickly and often to the right of the red. Although after 15 minutes of my break i had to go in the next crew on break came out and also saw the object and described the same thing.  At 4:30 am when i came out on a final break the object that we were observing was not in the sky any more.;42.1569;-95.7883
