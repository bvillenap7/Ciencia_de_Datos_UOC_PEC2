I checked the flightradar24 live website  Immediately.  No flight of any kind were in the direction of the moving lights.  Nor is that many houses or large towns in the direction. I took a couple pictures of the one object still in view with my camera phone.  I asked the other person here if he'd seen anything like it before, no, nothing like that. I inturn grabbed the binoculars and seen a fuzzy, cigar looking craft with very bright lights on the corners of it.  There was two very bright amber lights one white and one blue changing between red.  The distance of the object was around 1.5-2 miles away at an altitude of approximately 1500 feet.
