Orange lights in a spread formation.;2013-11-28 21:25:00;1 minute;Orange lights in a spread formation. Crystal clear night around 12 degrees.  Went out for a smoke when I looked up in the sky and observed (6) orange to red circular like objects that seemed to be in a spread formation.  Watched for about 15 seconds then ran in to grab my Galaxy 4 cell phone. Got off 5 shots and captured (2) before they disappeared.  Down loaded the photos to my desk top so I could zoom in and see what I had..... Called my brother in AZ to tell him....he said it was stealth helicopters.... They see them all the time out there in the desert.  Don't think they were choppers...... ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
