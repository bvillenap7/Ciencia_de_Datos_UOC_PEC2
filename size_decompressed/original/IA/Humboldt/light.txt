Saw an object (about the size of star) traveling very fast high in the sky.

Navy Wallops Island, VA, Flight Test Facility.  However, we observe that those two missiles would not have been visible from Iowa, supporting the observation by some UFO investigators that unusual sightings sometimes occur, concommitant to other, easily explained events.  NUFORC believes it may have witnessed this phenomenon on several occasions.)) Saw an object (about the size of star) traveling very fast high in the sky.  It then shot straight up out of sight. I was attending an outdoor concert, when I glance up to view the stars, when I saw an object that looked like a star moving very fast across the sky.  The object was in direct sun light so it must of been very high (since it was about 11:00 PM.)  It could of been a satellite, except for it made a small course change and disappeared in the sky.  The whole event lasted about 20 or 30 secounds.;42.7184;-94.2151
