Small light  traversing entire night sky in seconds from South to North to Northeast;2020-05-02 22:50:00;5 seconds;Small light  traversing entire night sky in seconds from South to North to Northeast At approximately 22:50 on May 2, 2020, a small whiteish blue object similar in appearance to a shooting star appeared high in the South sky (seemingly from nowhere). After appearing, the object immediately accelerated to the North with remarkable speed, and changed course to the Northeast.  Once the object changed it’s direction of travel, it continued Northeast for less than one second, then disappeared. Upon seeing this object, I assumed it was indeed a shooting star. However, the slight side to side swaying motion of the object as it flew north was like nothing I have ever witnessed before. The object traversed the entire night sky above me in 5 seconds or less, emitted no sound, and maneuvered much quicker than any aircraft I’ve seen.;42.6612;-93.9097
