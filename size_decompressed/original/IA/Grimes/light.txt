It had no flashing lights which was why it caught my attention.  It moved about as fast as you would expect a plane to fly.  I watched it for several minutes and the light dimmed and continued for several seconds and then the light was completely gone.  It was just to the north of being overhead of me and there was no cloud cover at all.  The only explanation I can think of is if maybe S.A.C. in Omaha was flying a Stealh bomber or fighter.  I would assume they have the capability to fly without lights, but it just seemed very odd.  I honestly do not know what it was;41.7026;-93.7831999999999
