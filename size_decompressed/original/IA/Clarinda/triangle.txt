silent and large UFO just above tree tops.;1998-10-01 21:00:00;60 seconds;silent and large UFO just above tree tops. There was a triangle shaped object just above the tree tops, at least 60 feet in the air right over the top of our heads.  It came out of nowhere and was almost like it wanted to be seen.   It made absolutely no sound, although it was a very large craft.  I remember it just sort of paralyzing my friend and I.  We suddenly stopped talking as it seemed to just float by us.  I remember the bottom of the aircraft reminding me of the ship on Star Trek it was dark grey with rivets etc.  There was a light on each point of the triangle.  I know they blinked different colors of yellow, red, and green. My sighting was at the age of 11, which was 12 years ago.. itâ€™s just one of those things I will never forget.  It was probably only going 20 miles per hour over our heads and when it was probably 30 yards ahead of us it shot up into the sky extremely fast.  All I saw then was what looked like a star until it disappeared.;40.75;-95.0404
