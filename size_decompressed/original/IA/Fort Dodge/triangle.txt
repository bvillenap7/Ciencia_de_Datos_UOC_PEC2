Dark Triangle with 2 lights seen traveling towards thunderstorms;2005-07-24 04:45:00;1 min;Dark Triangle with 2 lights seen traveling towards thunderstorms I'm not sure of the date, I know if happened during this week, and near the middle of it. I was stopped at a stop light and something caught my eye as I turned the corner.  I slowed to stop in the middle of the road (it was 4:45, no one was out).  I looked up and saw a large dark triangle in the sky.  It was pointed north east and had a green light on one of the rear angles, and a red on the other. There was no light on the front, although there did look like there could be one (perhpas it's just because I would expect there to be). I looked at the object for what seemed to be the longest time.  I'm not really sure how long exactly.  I remember eventually looking away, after what seemed in my head to be the awhile, and seeing lights coming up behind me.  The object had been motionless when I initially saw it, but now when I looked back up the object was slowly flying north east into an area of a thunderstorm (well at least clouds with lightning) and eventually disappeared into the clouds.

Iowa UFO invasion!;2006-10-24 22:00:00;Three hours;Iowa UFO invasion! I stepped outside to have a cigarette about 9:30 P.M., when I saw a blinking object high in the Northern sky. I quickly grabbed my camera and began filming.  As I focused on the blinking object it was triangular in shape, with lights on the outer points as well as one in the middle of the craft. I witnessed several of these coming from all directions, traveling relatively slow and making no sound.   This was not the half of it!!!!  Several craft were to pass over that night such as various orbs that seemed to spin, they would appear out of nowhere.  Some traveled across the sky, and some remained stationary.   At one point two red orbs appeared out of the Eastern sky traveling in tandom, this really freaked me out and I called on my wife to come outside and see this.  She was also shocked by these strange nighttime anomolies.  Oh yeah, I failed to mention seeing eight to ten shooting stars.  Some were so bright that they left a brief fiery trail that slowly faded out.  All of this and more.  At one point I thought we were under some sort of interplanetary invasion.   The good thing about this story is that I have the video footage to prove it!!!  Indeed a night, I and my wife shall never forget!!! ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested a copy of the video.
