A Glimpse of Rarity.;2013-08-13 23:30:00;Few seconds;A Glimpse of Rarity The UFO was a slightly faded yellowish-neon green.  Its shape was mostly similar to that of a wider cigar, and had a dark oval in its center most part.  I was standing on the back steps of my house near Crawford Park, looking at the stars.   While out of the corner of my vision, I noticed this oddity in the nights sky.  I got a complete glimpse of it, but as soon as I did, it vanished behind the trees in the horizon.   A very interesting experience! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.506;-94.1823999999999
