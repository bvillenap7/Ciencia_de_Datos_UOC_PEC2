Orange Red Light Formations Over Des Moines, Iowa on August 24, 2013 at 10:00 p.m.;2013-08-24 22:00:00;2 to 5 minutes;Orange Red Light Formations Over Des Moines, Iowa, on August 24, 2013 at 10:00 p.m. Orange red lights in a formation appeared over the city of Des Moines, Iowa.  We live in the country on the southside of Des Moines, 1 mile from the city limits.  I spotted the formation out my bedroom window.  All lights were equally placed in the sky.  They were in a vertical pattern, perfect exact smooth motion.  They all appeared almost instantly in the sky.   My picture window is floor to ceiling in my bedroom, and we have a wonderful view.  I have lived here for over twenty years and have never seen anything like it.  I grabbed my camera ran outside and the lights made absolutely no noise.  They moved so precise.  I could not believe what I was seeing.  I called my husband to come and watch.  He was also shocked and amazed.  The lights stayed in order, then as they moved from west to east, they moved somewhat northeast and disappeared.  There were seven lights in the first group and then two lights came a few seconds later, but moved much quicker in the! same direction.  One light followed.  All of these had the same appearance.  Round and orange/red. These were not airplanes, they were not helicopters.  No sound came from them.  They were here one minute and gone the next.  It was really amazing. They were in a stair step pattern and formed triangles.  We were standing on our deck just south of Des Moines.  We were looking north towards the city.  I tried recording the last orange/red light but my camera was not very good.  The images are unclear.  If we see anything further, I will try to capture an image with a better recording device. We checked the internet on YouTube and it appears that someone in Des Moines posted some lights that were over Des Moines the end of July 2013.  They looked somewhat similar but what we saw tonight was in a very concise formation.  I will try to jot it down below to show it to you when I first saw it not sure it will come through accurately, but I have it sketched here at home.  O                                                                    ALL LIGHTS STAYED IN PERFECT ALIGNMENT AND MOVED FROM EAST TO WEST OVER THE CITY.  THEN THEY CHANGED DIRECTION AND MOVED NORTHEAST.  THEY WERE OUT OF SIGHT VERY QUICKLY  O                O    O                                O                      O    O                                                         O    O                                                         O                       O    TWO LIGHTS APPEARED SHORTLY AFTER THE BIG FORMATION WAS GONE.  THEY MOVED IN THE SAME DIRECTION.  A FINAL LIGHT MOVED UP AND ACROSS THE SKY IN A QUICK MANNER USING THE SAME PATTERN AND DIRECTION.

6 bright orange lights in 2 vertical lines of 3.;2016-01-04 07:05:00;<5 seconds;6 bright orange lights in 2 vertical lines of 3. Monday, January 4, 7:05 AM â€“ Des Moines, IA.   I was stopped at a traffic light in the north-central  area of Des Moines on the way to work, when I noticed a total of (6) bright orange lights in the sky to the south-west.  They were in (2) vertical lines of (3) and resembled the number six when rolled on a domino.   In less than (5) seconds after I first noticed them, and before the light turned green, they all took off at the same time in different directions and vanished almost immediately.   I have no idea how high up in the air they were because it happened so fast but the lights were pretty small and they visually seemed to be pretty high. I have never seen anything like this, and so I have obviously never reported anything like this, either.;41.6004911036026;-93.6180533220729
