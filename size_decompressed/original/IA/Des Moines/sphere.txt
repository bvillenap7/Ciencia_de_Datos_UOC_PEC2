Large red/orange sphere seen above Des Moines, Ia.;2013-11-17 00:00:00;2 minutes;Large red/orange sphere seen above Des Moines, Ia. I was standing outside on my patio while walking my guests to their vehicles when my daughter pointed out that there was a bright orange/red ball in the sky.  I looked up, and watched it as it appeared to be headed in our direction.  It seemed to get brighter as it traveled, then seemed to 'hang' in one spot for over a minute.   After the suspended moment, it went back up into the sky and dissipated into darkness.   I am an avid meteor shower watcher and while I am aware that the Leonids are supposed to be viewable, this was too still, too large and bright to be viewable as a meteor in the middle of the city.   It was also the wrong color for me to believe that it was a meteor.;41.6004911036026;-93.6180533220729
From where I seen this it's exactly 8.25 miles from the Iowa Air National Guard 132nd Wing.;2017-10-14 20:00:00;5 seconds;From where I seen this it's exactly 8.25 miles from the Iowa Air National Guard 132nd Wing. On the aforementioned date the Des Moines airport had to close due to heavy rain we had came here to purchase a car at a local dealership, afterwards we went and ate at Denny's and as we were walking out to the car after eating I looked north and at 45Â° about 500 to 800 ft in the air I saw it a sphere that looked identical to the center petrospere on display at the Kelvingrove Gallery and Museum moving through the very well lit low hanging clouds from east to west against the wind.;41.6004911036026;-93.6180533220729
