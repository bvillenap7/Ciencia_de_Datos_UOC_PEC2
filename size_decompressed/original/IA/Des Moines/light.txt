I turned my attention to the tv and within a matter of minutes I looked at the clock again and it was 4 in the morning.  I was extremely confused.  My window was open and I had all of my clothes on except my underwear.  I can not account for the time missing. The next incident was in 2012.  I got up in the middle of the night to grab a drink from the fridge.  I had just opened the fridge door, when I saw this light coming through the sliding door.  I wasn't afraid, and the light came in and grabbed my foot.  The last memory I have is floating upside down above my apartment complex.   The next morning I woke up and thought it was a crazy dream.  But when I got up, I noticed my sliding door was slightly open.  Shortly after I found out I was pregnant.  My son was born in March 2013. These incidents are the ones I can remember.
