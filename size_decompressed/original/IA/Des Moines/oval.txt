PD));2009-01-23 19:00:00;three hours;object first appeared to be aircraft with search lights on but the closer I got to it the more I realized it was something else I was driving west on I-80 from iowa city to des moines and noticed what appeared at first to be a helicopter with its search light on or an airplane with its landing lights on.  I got closer to the object and and noticed it could not be a airplane because it would of landed at the dsm airport. This object kept its lights on for over two hours that I saw it for which seemed very strange to me.  It continued west north west past ames iowa when I turned off the interstate.  The closer I got to dsm the further it got away from me. ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??  PD));41.6004911036026;-93.6180533220729
