5 orange lights in a chevron shape;2014-03-29 10:50:00;5 seconds;I have never seen anything like this.   I was just settling into the outdoor hot tub at my apartment building and as I looked up at the night sky saw 5 orange lights in a chevron shape traveling very fast heading Northwest.   The craft was flying at helicopter height approximately at a velocity far exceeding commercial aircraft, though I did not hear a sonic boom.   It disappeared over the edge of my apartment building.   It reappeared about 5 minutes later, this time heading more north, Northwest (must have circled back to come from the South).  Incredible.;41.6004911036026;-93.6180533220729
