Boomerang shape many light made no sound.;1978-08-12 02:00:00;30 seconds;Boomerang shape many light made no sound I must start by saying I have never told this to anyone, it was about 2:00 in the am the summer of 1977 I was 17 at the time, I was returning from a nearby lake where I liked to fish for bullheads, the lake was about 1 half mile NE of my home and could be easily reached by foot if I walked across some livestock grazing fields on the family farm the walk would generally take about 20 min. in the day light but at night a bit longer.  As I was walking home I seen what at first I thought to be a helicopter coming from the SW I didn’t find it unusual to see planes or helicopters for the Des Moines airport was about 10 miles to the west of my home.  This is where things get upsetting, this thing, moved from about a half mile away from me to being within 50 foot over my head in what I can only describe the time it would take to walk three steps.  I remember trying to make sense of its appearance, I thought in a logical sense it must be a helicopter but it made no sound but I could feel a kind of low grade hum, its appearance was like a boomerang with the tips slightly pitching up and the bottom was covered with lights reds, greens and possibly blue.  The structure or body had a graphite look.  I remember the switch grass seamed to swirl but there was no wind, I was truly terrified, my home was only 70 or so yards away and all I could think of was I was going to die.   The last thing i remember was falling to the ground I never felt so small.  I tried to hide my face in my arms putting my hand on to my head I guess you would call it the Fedics position, then it was gone. I rose to my knees and that thing had already moved 2 miles away moving NW and I never heard it leave as I was curled up on the ground. As I can best recall the size was about 50 foot or more nose to tail and near to 60 yard from wing tip to wing tip. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

Lighted Triangle object hovers by major interstate;2004-08-19 20:30:00;10 m;Lighted Triangle object hovers by major interstate My wife, daughter and I were driving from Ankeny, Ia to Des Moines, Ia which is about a 12 mile drive.  As soon as I got onto I-35s in Ankeny I could see 2 bright lights in the sky and a decent altitude.  I thought it was an aircraft approaching the Ankeny airport which is a small facility that handles small planes.  The object didn't move though as I kept traveling and it seemed to get lower the closer I got to it.  When I was about a mile from the object I could finally make out a good description.  3 white lights formed in a triangle with a strange red light in the middle.  As I passed it I looked up and could see the smooth red light moving back and forth.  I turned around on the next exit and went back, but it was gone.  I've never seen a tower in that area that looked like that and I've never seen a plane with that red light. My wife also noticed 3 cars stopped along the side of the road apparently not working. When I got back home I called my friend who was at the Iowa State Fair to tell hime to watch the skies.  The reason being is that my sighting was very near the fairgrounds(3 miles).  He told me the next day that the only thing he saw was the news helicopter that was filming overhead get escorted away by 2 military type helicopters.;41.6004911036026;-93.6180533220729
Triangle sighted on I-35 in Des Moines;2004-08-20 20:00:00;10m;Triangle sighted on I-35 in Des Moines My wife and I were traveling south on I-35 from Ankeny to Des Moines, which is approx. a 12 mile drive.  As we got onto the interstate I noticed a brightly lit object in the sky about halfway between Ankeny and DSM.  I initially thought it was an aircraft approaching the Ankeny Regional Airport, but as I kept driving the object didn't seem to be getting closer.  From my early vantage point the object looked to be at a height of around 1500 ft.. The craft was still in plain view when I passed the mixmaster area which is 6 miles from DSM, but considerably lower(1000ft.?).  I now was thinking this might be some sort of tower, but I had never seen anything like this and being from that area I'm sure I would have noticed it before.  I'm also sure that I wouldn't have been able to see it at the altitude that it was at now when I first saw it in Ankeny.  When I finally passed it I could finally rule out a tower.  I slowed down to 50mph and rolled down the window to look at it.  It was right off the interstate and I was able to look directly up at it.  It was only 250 ft up with 3 bright lights in the shape of a triangle with a moving, smooth red light that moved back and forth in a fluid motion.  My wife who is an absolute skeptic on things like this pointed out 3 cars on the far side of the road that seemed to be not working.  I turned around on Guthrie Ave.(DSM), which is about a mile from where I saw the object, to go back and get some footage with my Digicam.  I could tell it was gone though and could now determine that it wasn't a tower because they just don't get up and walk away.  I am a former Marine and I know what helicopters look like at night.  This was something I'd never seen before.  On a side note, I called a friend of mine after I got home to tell him about my sighting.  He was at the Iowa State Fair which is approx 5 miles from where I saw the craft.  I told him to watch the skies.  The next day, he said the only thing he saw that night was a news helicopter get escorted from the area by 2 huey choppers.  I thought that was interesting.

Triangular UFO seen by family of 6 just south of Des Moines on I35.;2013-05-10 21:09:00;3-5 minutes;Triangular UFO seen by family of 6 just south of Des Moines on I35. After leaving Des Moines, Iowa on I35 south I noticed 2 bright lights to the east.  It looked like bright car lights but didn't look like they were moving. I then thought it was a tower with lights on it.   It then was moving towards us.  It was about 1/4 mile away and about the height of the red beacon towers for planes. Me, my wife and 4 kids were watching this.  Then about 50-100 yards before reaching I35 it turned north and we could see the bottom.  It was a perfect triangle shape with lights at the points that were not blinking and 3 lights in about halfway from the flat sides to the middle that were flashing.  It turned from flat to its side pretty fast but at a slow speed. It then was out of my view but the kids watched it until it was gone.  Last seen heading north towards Des Moines.
