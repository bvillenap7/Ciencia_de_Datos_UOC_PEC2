We were on a late night walk. Stopped in a feild about two blocks from our apartment and glanced at sky. Saw an exteremly bright red light west of a second magnatude star. Was at a stand still for several moments and then the object began to move south in a burst then held position for maybe a minute and began a stop and go motion south bound for about five minutes. Object begand heading in a southeast heading in the same stop and go fassion fading a bit then brightening until it was about parrallel with the 2nd magnatude star. At this point a strobbing red light descended from the object falshing around 5 time before it disappeared. The main object then turned and proceeded in a north bound direction for around three minutes, stopped and slowly faded out.;41.6004911036026;-93.6180533220729

Red light over Des Moines, Iowa vewed from Mitchellville, Iowa.;2008-08-04 21:30:00;15 seconds;Red light over Des Moines, Iowa vewed from Mitchellville, Iowa. On August 4, 2008 at approximately 9:30pm CST, I noticed a red blur in the sky over Des Moines, Iowa. I was in Mitchellville, Iowa, which is about 10 miles east of Des Moines, looking towards the west when I saw it. The blur lasted for a few seconds then turned into a white light and then the light faded away. I don’t know if it was a UFO, but I don’t know of an aircraft that could produce that type of light.;41.6004911036026;-93.6180533220729

It moved as though it may land in front of me.   I first thought it was an airplane in trouble.  It flew like it was making a pattern. It had a large tail then went down.  No explosion no noise. Very cool to see, as it raises so many questions.;41.6004911036026;-93.6180533220729

3 Bright Red Lights in a Triangle Formation;2012-11-03 23:45:00;10 minutes;3 Bright Red Lights in a Triangle Formation At approximately 11:45pm central time on November 3rd I went out into my front porch to smoke a cigarette.  I was looking east when I noticed a bright orange/red light in the sky.  Upon a second look I noticed two more identical lights.  The lights were aligned like the 3 points of a triangle.  I could not see a solid object between the lights but the way they moved together made me believe they were part of a solid object. The lights were above the tree line and appeared to be very close to me.  I was worried that while I was sitting there the object/lights were going to fly over my house.  They appeared to be much lower than an airplane would fly.  I would estimate that they were approximately 100-200 feet in the air, maybe higher but definitely below the light cloud cover.   I remember thinking that when the object flew over, it was so low that I would be able to see all the detail and that frightened me. The lights were gliding very slowly, not wavering from their position in the triangle and moving in a westerly direction.  The lights were circular in shape and were about 5 times brighter and larger than the brightest/largest star in the sky. I watched the lights for about 10 minutes as they moved west, toward me, then they began to slowly fade until they appeared no brighter or larger than the average star. I wish, in retrospect, that I had grabbed my camera but I was too scared/in awe to go get it while the event was happening.  After the lights faded I immediately went inside and woke my husband but it was too late, they were gone. I am a 30 year old mother of two with a 4 year degree from a reputable university.  I am an admitted skeptic.  I have never witnessed anything like this before.;41.6004911036026;-93.6180533220729
