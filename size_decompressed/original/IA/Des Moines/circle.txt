white light changing directions in the sky.;2001-08-01 21:30:00;10 minutes;white light changing directions in the sky. We were looking at the sky and saw some regular stars and venus or something like always. but then about 10 seconds later it was pointed out that one of the obects was moving southeast coming from the southwest. we watched it for a second and it had no flashing lights and was all white. it then started to change direction a little and started heading a little more towards the east, changing direction so we knew it wasnt a sattelite. we watched it until it disappeared over the other houses and we could not see it any more.;41.6004911036026;-93.6180533220729
Hazed lights traveling dew north in a clockwise position.;2007-04-23 11:12:00;10min;Hazed lights traveling dew north in a clockwise position. Two very light white shaped halos spining in clockwise direction but moving north. They looked like a fog light coming through a dense fog. No sound audible. The object itself was not visable to me it was only the lights traveling in a silent fast movement 2 steps forward 1 step back always backtracking. The two lights were never far from each other.;41.6004911036026;-93.6180533220729
3 circular orange reddish lights in the shape of a triangle seen in Des Moines, IA near the State Capitol building.;2012-06-16 23:27:00;35 seconds;3 circular orange reddish lights in the shape of a triangle seen in Des Moines, IA near the State Capitol building. On June 16, 2012 at 11:27pm CST in Des Moines, Iowa, my friend and I were on the south side of the State Capitol building. My friend saw three bright, solid orange reddish circular lights in the sky forming a triangle with the point on top.  By the time I turned the corner, now heading north, we both saw that now there were only two lights side by side. We were on the east side of the State Capitol building now facing north. The lights were stationary at about 40 degrees above the horizon.   And we did not hear any noise.  After parking the car and a quick look for my camera, there was only one left. The last one lingered on for a bit more (5 seconds) then I was able to see it moving away heading east south east at a fast pace (another 4-5 seconds until I couldn’t see it any more.) The whole ‘event’ lasted around 35 seconds. Recap: •	June 16, 2012 at 11:27pm CST in Des Moines, Iowa •	Majority of event viewed on east side of State Capitol building •	3 solid, bright orange reddish circular lights forming a triangle •	In the North sky – 40 degrees high •	One by one lights leaving •	Last one heading ESE at fast pace •	Event lasting around 35 seconds;41.6004911036026;-93.6180533220729

Three white shaped circles.  Motion was circular.  One would disappear and reappear.;2014-08-29 23:52:00;15 minutes;Three white shaped circles.  Motion was circular.  One would disappear and re-appear. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Yes it was evening. Friday night of 8/29/14  I am not good at describing things.  I have never seen anything like it before.  I live on 39th st and I was looking west as if it was 40th st.  It was cloudy, but the lights were bright enough that you can see them through the clouds.   The motion was circular anf speed was pretty fast.  It had three white shaped circles.  When it would circle around one or two would disappear and reappear.  I hope this helps.

Orange/amber fuzzy sphere moving across sky in Central Iowa, S.E. to N.W..;2017-05-14 23:00:00;1 minute;orange/amber fuzzy sphere moving across sky in Central Iowa, S.E. to N.W. While in the backyard of my home, I glanced up at the sky, S.E. direction, and noticed a glowing orange/amber circle of light slowly moving to the N.W., moving slowly but discernibly.  It almost looked like an amber street light from a distance, was fuzzy, and had jagged lines coming from the center of the object.   It started about 45 degree angle from horizon, moved up and over my head but very far in the distance.  When it was in the western sky, I lost track of it due to the trees obscuring the view.  I was in total shock as I had never seen something like that before.  It made no noise and did not change color, shape, or speed.;41.6004911036026;-93.6180533220729
