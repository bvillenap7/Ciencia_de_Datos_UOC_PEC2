Cloaking Cigar...;2003-07-31 14:00:00;5-10 Seconds;Cloaking Cigar... I don't remember the exact date, but I was driving along route 65/69 on a sunny afternoon.  I checked my driver side mirror to change lanes when I saw a silver colored object in the sky.  The object was easily noticed since the sun was reflecting off of the object.   At first, I thought it was a blimp, but I found it peculiar that it did not move.  Even more surprising, the object moved away at incredibly high speed and accelerated faster than anything I have seen before.   The object was cigar shaped and looked very similar to a silver blimp.  The most unusual thing about this object is that as it flew away in the opposite direction, I noticed that the object became transparent and eventually it dissapeared completely.  I could see clouds through the object like it was a semi-transparent mirror.  The effect was similar to the stuff you see in Star Trek.   I only saw it a few seconds in my driver side mirror, but it was definitely not of this world.  If it is technology invented by man, then I am most impressed.  I know the military has been experimenting with different types of camo technology, but as far as I know, the technology does not work this fast or effectively.  I suspect the object is of unknown origin...   Considering the time of day and the number of people on the road I was traveling, I couldn't have been the only person who saw it...
