What I thought was just a satellite, with binoculars I see 3 traveling together at the same speed.;2000-04-28 23:15:00;2 minutes;What I thought was just a satellite, with binoculars I see 3 traveling together at the same speed. I was sitting on my deck (suburban Des Moines) looking at various parts of the sky with my binoculars.  I had put them down and was looking up at the Big Dipper, and just then, I notice a faint object moving just below Dubhe (alpha Ursa Majoris).  This is not a jet or an airplane, it is much higher, no blinking lights, like a satellite would look crossing the sky, and I am a fairly seasoned sky watcher and I know what satellites look like and this appears to be one.  And I see that it is moving from NW to SE across the face of the Big Dipper and so I pick up the binoculars and find it and all of a sudden I see 3 of them in my binocular (10 x 50) field!  At this time they are almost straight overhead.  The original one was the brightest and the others were a little fainter, you would not of been able to see them naked eye, only with the binoculars.  The fainter 2 were traveling at the same speed as the brighter one and they appeared to be ahead of the brighter one.  They all traveled together from NW to SE and of course they disappeared as they reached approximately 45 degrees above the horizon due to the city lights.  This was for real folks!  I was alone and so there are no other witnesses but I am a perfectly normal sane guy that was just out stargazing.  I don't think satellites travel in 3's like this but maybe they do.  Does anybody have an explanation? thanks. ((NUFORC Note:  We have had several reports similar to this one over the last week, or so.  We believe they may be yet another launch of the U. S. Navy N.O.S.S. satellites, which fly in formation in a triangular pattern.  This is only surmise at this point, however.  PD. Wednesday, 03MY00));41.6004911036026;-93.6180533220729
Green lit-up horizon with saucer like flying object.;2007-09-17 23:00:00;About a half hour;Green lit-up horizon with saucer like flying object. Me and my dad were out in a graveyard in Des Moines trying to get a picture of a ghost or something, and he doesn't beleive me, but there was a UFO-like thing out on the horizon, the whole thing was lit up green with a black saucer-like figure flying slowly above it, It had lights and the whole works!   Our car engine had stopped for about a minute or so, until it was out from being infront of the car. This was probably in a 5 mile radius from us.  I couldn't beleive it! I told my dad, and he refused to look back.  By the time we got home, he looked back, and it was too late. It was gone already. But what would you expect from a UFO?

4 Fighter Jets continuous pattern. 2 F16's elongated N-S oval grid and 2 F16's elongated E-W oval grid. 2 craft leave fast after 3 hrs;2008-03-06 18:30:00;2.5 hours;4 Fighter Jets continuous pattern. 2 F16's elongated N-S oval grid and 2 F16's elongated E-W oval grid. 2 craft leave fast after 3 hrs 03/06/2008 6:30pm approximately heard a set of fighter jets take off in a hurry, a few minutes later another set of fighter jets took off, made a note of this because I love to hear and watch the jets, I always say &quotgo get em boys&quot and &quotbe safe&quot and they make a very distinct sound when flying  7:00pm kept hearing them fly over  7:30pm after hearing the jets constantly flying over went outside, watched them for a bit making a large oval patterns 2 fighter jets flying in formation in a large oval North and South direction 700-1000 ft altitude 2 other fighter jets flying in formation in a large oval East and West direction 700-1000 ft altitude both sets of jets flying in a counter-clockwise direction if looking up at them from the ground used binoculars to look at the jets they had a blue lighted cockpit (not a bright light) watched for 30-45 minutes gut feeling was something is out of the ordinary that this just isn't right they do not fly training missions on a Thursday night over a heavily populated area that low  8:00-8:15pm went back inside to help my wife put the boys in bed  8:45-9:00pm got dressed in heavier clothes (cold out that night) and went outside fighter jets are still flying at the same level same direction. nothing else in the sky at that altitude I did see jets at a very high altitude flying what looked to be a grid pattern 2 north to south with the red and blue marker lights and 15 minutes later 2 east to west with red blue marker lights( those could have been commercial jets not sure to high of an altitude to tell) commercial aircraft were still going to the airport but they were staying west of town, had a scanner on to listen to aircraft and I did hear a pilot tell the tower &quotall we have seen is just a little light show tonight&quot  9:30-10:00pm in the middle of where the fighter jets were flying I saw bright white light like some one flipped a switch it was stationary for a split second before it shot up and out going out of the atmosphere in a SW direction at about 60 degrees there was a light trail behind it as it left it looked solid,holding your arms out it was about 6-8 inches I guess the best way to explain would be take one of those triangles from school face south hold your arms up and out at a 45 degree angle with the straight part of the triangle on the right side and the 60 degree angle on the left. I almost fell off my deck when I saw this about 45 seconds later another object exact same thing from almost the exact same position just slightly more to the west and at about 4 inches up the trail of the other object that trail only lasted a split second but to give you an idea of the second object/lights position. the 2nd object/light took off up and out at a 30-40 degree angle in a SW direction also, again same thing face south use a triangle with the straight part on the right and the 30 degree angle on the left, up and out of the atmosphere  10:15-10:30pm Fighter jets landed  not sure what I saw gut feeling like I said something was very different, not right, I do not belive that the fighter jets were flying a training mission over a heavily populated area, I do not belive that whatever those lights/objects were anything coming into the atmosphere, they were goin out, I have seen plenty of falling stars that was not it, I do not belive that it was space junk coming into the atmosphere either. the light was bright like melted metal and bright white. That night it was clear and dark. as goofy as it sounds it reminded me of a craft going into warp drive.;41.6004911036026;-93.6180533220729
Flashing and strobing object, flashing and strobing military jets, and two white lights moving above the Des Moines Iowa area.;2009-08-11 21:00:00;30 to 45 min;Flashing and strobing object, flashing and strobing military jets, and two white lights moving above the Des Moines Iowa area. I was noticing several jets doing strange circular patterns over Des Moines, Iowa.  They were using intermittent, seemingly random, fairly bright flashing strobes of red and white.  They were moving in circular patterns.  The strobes would stop completely which made the jets was very hard to fallow by sight, then they would be bright again.  Then I noticed a similar strobe light that was not a jet aircraft.  It was flashing red and white randomly, it would move then disappear and then reappear in another part of the sky.  It's direction was never constant it seemed to wonder around the sky. It seemed that the jets were trying to get close to it.  Then, I noticed another smaller white light that was moving, (I thought it was a satellite at first) I then noticed another white light, the first white light proceeded to do a course change towards the second object and quick and smooth did a complete circle around this object.  Both objects were white lights and m! oved away from each other and faded up into the night sky.  All this happened while military jets were in the area circling.  I noticed the original (not jet aircraft) flashing object move west away from the city area.  The jets fallowed, I watched the sky for about a half hour then the Jets went back over quickly to the East of the Des Moines area.;41.6004911036026;-93.6180533220729

Everything se;2011-09-02 20:45:00;1 minute;Sometime after 8:30, I went home with my mother and after parking in the driveway,  I looked up (facing north) as always.  Everything seemed to be normal and I could hear fireworks going off.   After looking for awhile I could spot the Big Dipper on the left of me and the moon on the far right.  In between that, more towards the left (West), there was just a random dot of light, then it disappears, and another would show up but far from the first.  This happened around 5-7 times and in different section of the sky between Big Dipper and the moon. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Floating white light with dim blinking light still in the sky with no sound.;2012-07-13 01:24:00;10 minutes;floating white light with dim blinking light still in the sky with no sound. two friends and i were taking a late night drive when one of my friends looked out of the window to the north east and saw a large white light and a dim blinking light we tried to get pictures but our phones weren't strong enough to capture it so we kept driving. we stopped on the side of the road and looked at it very close and listened, it was about 300 or so feet above a area of forest.  there was no sounds so we turned around and started heading towards it, it slowly hovered south with the lights in the same place and made no sound as we started getting closer it very quickly went west.  It was out of sight in less then a minute.;41.6004911036026;-93.6180533220729

Driving along I-80 west bound and saw about 7-9 bright red lights floating in the sky at about the height that a  helicopter would fly.;2014-11-08 21:30:00;3 minutes;Driving along I-80 west bound and saw about 7-9 bright red lights floating in the sky at about the height that a  helicopter would fly.  Didn't appear to be moving.  Very disorganized no shape.  There were about 4-5 up high and then another 3-4 kind of in a line going up&down direction below the others.  I drove directly underneath them, was able to see them in my mirrors just as bright.  When I pulled off on the next exit so I could take a video of it they were all gone...every single one.  Never seen anything like it in my life!!;41.6004911036026;-93.6180533220729
