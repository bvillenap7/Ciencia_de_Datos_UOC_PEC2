craft hovering over Des Moines River in Iowa;1989-06-30 01:00:00;30 min max;craft hovering over Des Moines River in Iowa I can't remember much of this as I was a young teen at the time and personally was not able to see it myself, although I have been a witness since this episode around 1998 which was unbelievable, but I will go on with that later. Anyway, I do remember that this article was in the Des Moines register with a Picture of the Craft itself hovering over the River which is next to down town. This picture was very clear and ther was no mistaking that this was not something we created here on earth.I really cannot remember the exact date this happened(1980-1990's) but I do know this was a huge story that went on for a while but I am uanable to find anything out on the web on it. I am very interested in finding this story as I've heard so many stories from the saucer was using the water to stengthen itself? to getting power from the Electricity poles in the surrounding areas. It crazy some of the stories people can come up with. I'm positive these quotes were not something the newspaper had said and I am also not sure of exactly how long the ship was there but I know many people seen it driving across the bridges to get to work down town as did the traffic controller that moniters traffic from his news cam via helicopter. This was a huge thing. I'm hoping you can help me find more on this.  My other incident was in the late 1990's. Myself and a boyfriend at the time were standing outside talking on a warm summer night at a desolate softball diamond behind the appts I used to live in altoona, Ia. All of the sudden we look up and there is a flat shaped saucer. You could see the dimension of it so well due to the full moon. There were no lights on the craft that we could see. we both watched this as I would hover in one spot for 10-15 seconds then it would move straight to its left and stop and hover there where it stayed for much longer. At this point we went inside to get my dad to come out and see it adn of course he insisted we were seeing things and that we were. I grabbed an old telescopr that most likely was going give me no help since it was very old and we came back out where it was still there. I was so quite out side that it almost scared us but intrigued us even more. No sooner did I get the telescope out of its holder, the saucer shot straight out to the south and dissapeared. There is no way this was shooting star, or a plane or anything else made by humans as planes and such cannot hover in one spot and move at the speed of light with no noise whatsoever. There was not a trail, sonic boom, nothing. I am now 33 years old and to this day I believe in what I seen what not my imagination nor was it the person I was with.

my friend and i saw a blurry white shape, 'bobbing' far off in a blue sky. we got the binoculars and with those saw that it was a class;1996-09-14 18:00:00;15 minutes;my friend and i saw a blurry white shape, 'bobbing' far off in a blue sky. we got the binoculars and with those saw that it was a classic saucer. it was canted slightly, moving very slowley from left to right over a very wide horizon - we were on a 2nd story balconey overlooking flat city terrain. it was whitish, with an opalescent 'bubble' top -pale pastes colors. to the left of it 'floated' 6-8 perfectly round white circles in a wavy perpendicular line. there was no detail in the white circles. it took about 15 minutes for these objects to move in the sky from our far left to directly opposite us. at this point one of the (much smaller) white circles - the bottom one- slowley moved up in a straight line into the bottom of the saucer. then the whole group began to slowley move away from us in a straight line - rather than from left to right, until they disappeared into some wispy small cloud  cover. my friend, a doctor, whose eye-sight is better than mine, said she could see a green laser-like line shoot out from the bottom of the saucer to the ground a couple of times. for the duration of this event a jet, probably from the local army base, was in the sky, coming from the far right and moving toward the craft. we couldn't tell if it was chasing the craft because we had no way to percieve depth - ie - how close the jet was to us as compared to the craft in terms of latitude. the jet never got close to the craft. the jet, compared to the craft and circles, looked so 'heavy' and 'clunky'...and the craft compared to the jet so ephemeral and light, both in weight and movement. there was no sound , but it was far away. i submitted a written report to NIDS about a year ago.;41.6004911036026;-93.6180533220729
Two objects leading a third, or was the two  objects being followed ?;2005-03-11 21:30:00;3 minutes (maybe);Two objects leading a third, or was the two  objects being followed ? ( I am in my 50’s ), and at approximately 9:15 p.m. CST on Friday, March 11th 2005, I took my dog out into our back yard. It was a very clear night and the stars were bright.   Maybe 10-15 minutes had passed by and I looked up at the sky just to gaze at all the stars.  Then something caught my eye.  Coming from the East was a pair of objects that looked about as bright as a star and traveling side by side and maybe 100-200 yards across from each other.  Both were a steady white color and traveling at what seemed like a high altitude.   But, behind them, and maybe at a slightly lower altitude, was also another object.  It almost looked as if the front two objects were leading the back object, or the back object was following the front two. I could not see a shape or anything other than the white lights of the first two objects.  The back object had what looked like three colors that rotated and they appeared to be towards the bottom. It had red on the starboard side, white in the center, and blue on the port side.  These lights were all about the same intensity as far as brightness. To me, it reminded me of a toadstool. That is, it looked like a disc on top and then like a short stem in the center and that is the area which the lights appeared to be coming from.   As I watched these three objects approaching the Des Moines area, the two white objects traveling together made a gradual turn and took a new heading of SSW.  As they made the turn, I could see stars in between them so this seemed to rule out the idea of them as one large object. No contrails could be seen.  The object with the rotating lights continued on its east to west path and as it passed over head I did not see any lights, but once it passed over, I could once again see these rotating colors.  The first time I saw it I was going to dismiss it as a jet that maybe had its landing lights on, because that would explain the white light in the middle. But on planes, the lights are apart and you see a black gap between them.  These lights appeared to be side by side and reminded me of the lights on top of a police car, only larger.  At no time was noise ever heard.  Between the time I first spotted these objects until the time they passed out of sight was probably 3 minutes.;41.6004911036026;-93.6180533220729
Disc shaped object flashing red and blue lights.;2014-03-11 20:36:00;33 seconds;Disc shaped object flashing red and blue lights Noticed an object (1) in the sky between downtown Des Moines and the South Side of Des Moines.  The object flashed a red and blue light alternately from one end to the other, and appeared to be a disc shaped.  After I noticed the object in the sky I pulled over to the side of the road to get a clear view of it.  It was moving very slow and then it stopped and after 2-5 seconds slowly dissipated out of sight.  With the airport being a couple of miles away,  I waited and observed a few planes and helicopters to be sure what I had seen could not have been either.  What I had seen was quite surreal.;41.6004911036026;-93.6180533220729
Large silent dark object in sky producing strange cloud behaviour.;2014-06-14 13:50:00;1 minute;large silent dark object in sky producing strange cloud behaviour. Looking out the window at the strange cloud formation a dark aria came into sight.  Did not look like an airplane, and to be as big as it was there was no noise.   Clouds around it seem sucked in then pushed out in a circular motion, as if to make itself more blurry.;41.6004911036026;-93.6180533220729
Five shiny saucer like, tear drop objects in formation outside an airplane window.;2015-07-30 12:37:00;5 seconds;Five shiny saucer like, tear drop objects in formation outside an airplane window. I was on a two-hour flight from the east coast, to go to my grandmother’s funeral.  I was sitting in the row directly behind the first-class passenger seats on the right side of the plane in the window seat.  Since I was on a smaller flight, this put my seat to where I was able to see clearly outside the window and still be able to see the front of the wing. 	During the majority of the time of the flight, I put my ear buds in and napped, as I usually do.  About 20 minutes before landing, a bell went off waking me up.  The bell was followed by an announcement, which caused me to remove my ear buds.  The announcement said to please close the windows as the craft prepared to descend.  Once this was said, the lights inside had dimmed. 	I have been on many flights before and really thought nothing of this. I figured maybe the announcement to do so, was a courtesy to others who might still be resting, or due to the summer heat in order to keep the plane cool when it had landed.  Regardless of what was said I kept window open, and watched the sights of the plane as it prepared to land. 	About twenty seconds of looking at the flooding of the many creeks and rivers of the area, I witnessed five shiny silver “tear drop/saucer” shaped objects in a formation of four on the bottom and one on top.  Each one was the same size, looking about the size of a mini van, but I could not tell how far away they were.  They looked as if they were floating, but due to how fast the plane was going, they had to be moving at some sort of slightly slower speed than the plane. 	I was definitely stunned and confused at what I had just seen, and looked at the businessman next to me, who just shrugged his shoulders.;41.6004911036026;-93.6180533220729

Object changing colors (green,red,white) moving very unnaturally..;2020-01-02 01:40:00;5;Object changing colors (green,red,white) moving very unnaturally.. I was walking to a QuikTrip nearby my apartment.  I go occasionally to buy a few things for the night and always admire the night sky.  On my way there I noticed a star that was twinkling in the sky (changing from red, green, and white quickly.   Got my snacks and left. On my way back home (facing away from the twinkling star) I noticed what I thought to be another one.  This one was different.. it was changing colors but very slowly.  I couldn’t keep my eyes off it.  Between the color changes I squinted my eyes to try and make out a shape and I could kind of see a oval or typical “saucer” shape.  I was thinking “yeah right” to myself but this is where shit got weird.  This craft began to move very slowly.  I then knew it wasn’t a star anymore..  I kept watching.  It then moved to the left very quickly then STOP at a dime.  My heart sank and I ran inside.  My girlfriend tried to calm me down on the phone but I couldn’t believe my eyes.  Do drones behave that way?  Do they! fly then stop abruptly at a split second?  I personally NEVER seen one do it.  The movement just seemed unnatural.. like there was some sort of pilot maneuvering this thing.  I still am very shooken by this and don’t know what to believe. If there was a confirmed drone flying around Des Moines shining as bright as a star I would feel relieved. Until then, I feel like I’m going to remain puzzled.;41.6004911036026;-93.6180533220729
hovering saucer nears ground then disappears in sky;2020-04-30 21:09:00;2 minutes;hovering saucer nears ground then disappears in sky This ufo was seen at 9:09 p.m. 4/30/20 in Des Moines, Iowa 50321 approximately 5 minutes from the Des Moines International airport.  The airport is so close to where this ufo was spotted (in a residential neighborhood) that plane’s could be seen and heard taking off.  The flying object seen was approximately the length/width of an average home.  When seen, it was approximately 200ft in the air above me.  What stood out the most was the red dot of light in the center of the bottom (stomach one could say) of the aircraft.  Smooth shiny metal, like one might see on a brand new car from the 50’s, detailed this aircraft as seen in the illustration above.  It accented the red light while branches of this metal lining reached the sides of the aircraft.  The actual build of this ufo was of blue color at first sight, but when looking longer, it had more of a teal color, one might even perceive as green.  The aircraft’s build was smooth with absolutely no bolts or screws in sight.  Along with ! this, the blueish teal material around the metal-like accents looked almost translucent and soft.  When this aircraft was in the air, it did not fly in a straight line, but more so hovered and traveled where it liked.  There was a low rumbling noise that came out of it, but there was absolutely no exhaust coming out of the hovercraft like a normal airplane would have, including no smell of gases leaving the ufo as a normal aircraft would have.  When flying away, the ufo simply disappeared in the distance.  When first spotting this aircraft, I attempted to take a video which ultimately failed as when I was holding my camera completely straight, the aircraft seemed to push and pull my camera away and unfocus it, which reminded me of trying to stick two pieces of magnetic pieces together which can't be done as the force between them moves each of the pieces away.  There was a white light that topped this saucer which is what could be seen from far away.  The side view drawn above is more of a rough sketch of what I saw, only drawn to give one an idea of the shape, while the view from directly underneath is a more complete and accurate view of what I saw, as this is when the aircraft came very close. ;41.6004911036026;-93.6180533220729
