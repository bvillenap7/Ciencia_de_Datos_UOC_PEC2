Looked like shooting star, Except they had no tail, went from south horizion to north horizion at a very high rate of speed;1999-06-05 02:00:00;4 sec;Looked like shooting star, Except they had no tail, went from south horizion to north horizion at a very high rate of speed I am an over the road truck driver, at aprox 02:00 hour's while I was driving north on hwy 35 between Osceola, Iowa  and  Des Moines, Iowa. I saw A point of light ( Bigger than the star's and much brighter.)going at a high rate of speed, from the South to the North. ( Out the driver's side window, which was down.) It looked like a shooting star Except there was no tail to it at all, then about 15-20 min's later, I saw the exact same thing, also going from South to North.  The reason that I am letting you know about this is because this same thing happend about 4 month's ago, Except it was colder outside and I had the window's up, and I thought that maybe it was a reflection off the glass from some other source (passing car, ect.) But this time with the window down, that was not the case. I should mention that the first event also had two object's about 15-20 min's apart. I do'nt know if this is anything at all, but I thought I would tell you about it.             Thank you for your time.;41.6004911036026;-93.6180533220729
Grenn trailing orb seen in Iowa woods!;2001-01-27 22:00:00;5secounds;Grenn trailing orb seen in Iowa woods! I'm seventeen and I just witnessed something very crazy. My friends and I were out four wheeling in my friends truck. It was some trails by the Des-Moines river. We were dirving back over this ledge, when plain as day, there was a green light in the sky. At first it looked like a green star. It sat there for about 2 to 3 secounds, then it seemed to fall from the sky, green light was trailing behind it. My friend and I started to freak out. I still can't belive that it happened. It was only two hours ago. Any ways the object was a perfect orb. You could tell that it had three deminsions to it. One of my friends and I are the only ones that saw the whole account. Another member of our party just saw it fall. My other friend that was driving didn't see any of it. We couldn't stop talking about it. My friend that was driving started making fun of us when hiw head lights cut out. We started to go up a hill and couldn't make it up it.I then looked back and I saw a flah of light come out of the woods were the object had apeared to fall. It was a bright flash that looked like a giant flame for about a secound.Nothing else happened after that.;41.6004911036026;-93.6180533220729

One night, as I was walking around outside, I noticed a very small red light in the NE sky, moving SW.  As it got closer it was getting too big to be an airplane so it now had my complete interest.  It was red and round and glowed slightly.  I watched it move SLOWLY into the western sky, and then come to a stop.   At this point I ran in to get my co-worker.  Seconds later when we returned we observed the craft seemingly split into three or four smaller crafts.  It was hard to tell because they appeared hazy, as if one merger into the other.  It is also possible the one craft was changing shapes or making stationary movements of some kind.   Then a single craft continued into the western sky until it was out of sight, at a much higher rate of speed than by which it arrived.   I am 50 and have never seen anything remotely like this in my life.;41.6004911036026;-93.6180533220729
