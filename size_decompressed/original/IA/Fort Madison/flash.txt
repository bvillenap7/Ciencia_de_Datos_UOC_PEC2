UFO Crashland in Fort Madison Iowa high school football field;2010-03-18 20:50:00;5 seconds;UFO Crashland in Fort Madison Iowa high school football field My associate and I were out for a late evening walk on March 18th when we witnessed a bright flash of yellow light crash land into the Fort Madison High School football field at what would appear to be a high speed.  Minutes later we noticed a rancid smell and smoke in the air quickly followed by the howl of emergency vehicle sirens.  We tried to get a closer look, but the authorities had arrived and would not allow us any closer to the crashed craft. That night, there were also reports of a flying saucer hovering over a remote park on the outskirts of Fort Madison, approximately 2 miles from the Fort Madison High School.  We cannot confirm whether or not this was the same object or two objects that happened to be in the same area.;40.631;-91.3395
