We had just finished doing some work on a house when we left for bed. My son, Larry, saw an orb moving in complex turns through the air. He first told me and then proceeded to tell the rest of the people there. There were about 5 people, not including myself, that saw the objects. They were suprisingly easy to see. They didn't seem to try to mask their appearance. They first moved in tight circles, but then moved on to more complex flight patterns such as figure 8-like designs and even more complex star-like moves. I had my camera with me, so I took a few shots on my digital. I have included one of the pictures and will send more if requested.  http://img88.imageshack.us/img88/2820/untitled16lv.jpg;40.631;-91.3395
