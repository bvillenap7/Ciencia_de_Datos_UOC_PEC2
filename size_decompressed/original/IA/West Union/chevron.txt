While out in front of the house no more than a few minutes later we noticed 8 orange glowing boomerang chevron shapes moving across the sky traveling south to north.  Weird part was they were flying in a birds V pattern and then switched position so that 6 were in a line with 2 side by side in front.they were moving at a decent rate of speed.
