3 reddish oval shaped with white lights inside them being followed by a black suburban.;2015-05-26 23:30:00;5 minutes;3 reddish oval shaped with white lights inside them being followed by a black suburban. I was leaving my house and walked to a buddy’s house, which is 3 blocks away (about a 2 min. walk).  I knocked on his door and when he didn’t answer I turned around to see a man I didn’t recognize walking down the street.   I looked north and noticed 3 reddish or orangeish type oblong spheres with white lights in the middle of them, coming just above the tree line.   The 3 objects stopped and hovered in the air above me.  They couldn’t have been more than 40ft. to 60ft. in the air, moving without a sound.   I took out my flashlight and shined it at the objects but to no avail.  One went straight east, one went South East and the other just went south then appeared to turn east.  All objects seem to be moving at a surprisingly slow rate of speed.   I did not keep track of the objects because I remembered that our area would be having these new Drones flying around.  So I dismissed it as such.  What is also curious is that a black Chevy Suburban came down the road and went East in the direction of the objects. And unfortunately my phone had fried 2 days earlier otherwise I would have had time to take pictures of them. I also have footage of metallic spheres being deployed behind my vehicle on a 2 separate occasions prior to this incident.;43.1892;-95.6676
