Strange object passing through Muscatine;2006-05-25 00:30:00;2 mins.;Strange object passing through Muscatine Well me and my wife were travling south on U.S. 61 by-pass, passing Cedar Street when my wife saw something to her left which then she asked me what it was then I looked and it about 1/4 mile away from us from the car and it was heading south also and it was about 50-80 feet from the ground, and moving about 35-45 MPH. It had one really bright light in the front and the bottom also had a much larger light, and the middle to the end of the craft had a blinking white light.  Then I told her to turn left on Locust Street so that we could at least get under it or get there before it got to us, when we were flying onto it, it passed us and the only thing that I saw was its back end which it looked very strange, really skinny in width, but really long.   After we saw it, we tried to chase it down, when we got to the bottom of the hill, there was nothing in the sky. Never seen anything like this before.;41.4319;-91.0485
