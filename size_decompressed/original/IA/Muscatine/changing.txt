3 lighted object  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus, we suspect.  PD));2004-04-25 23:00:00;60mins.;3 lighted object Well about every night I get home, I have been seeing some kind of a light in the west of my house, which at 1st I thought it was a star but every night its in the same place, the other night I watched for about an hour, the whole time it would be just sitting for a while then it would just move side by side, or up and down, after watching it, it jetted out to the east going up, but not straight up. Well tonite I got a telescope and it looked like it it had one blue light and one red light right next together, and the big bright white light, it would dim out then just come real bright.

All I could see was the colored lights changed shapes and it was in a square then a triangle shape then lights shot around so fast we couldn't have done it.  The lights were white, red, green and blue.  Where it left the clouds left like it was hiding behind it.;41.4319;-91.0485
