Here is our descriptions:  red-orange looking big sphere with smaller.;2014-05-11 20:30:00;5 minutes;My aunt and her husband called my mother.  My mother called me.  Here is our descriptions:  red-orange looking big sphere with smaller one close behind it moving northwest from Memorial Park Cemetery towards The Palms.  The smaller one sling shot around the larger one and was in front and then slowed a bit.  For as low as it was (probably 1000 feet) it made no sound.   We followed until out of site.;41.4319;-91.0485
5 spheres moving in formation.;2016-04-12 16:19:00;10 minutes;5 spheres moving in formation. I was driving in Muscatine towards the Mississippi River due east and noticed a reflection in the sky and noticed it was a sphere object and then focused in on the object and noticed 4 more of these in the sky.  These 5 objects started to move in a formation that resembled the number 8 simultaneously.  At times, one would disappear and reappear.;41.4319;-91.0485
