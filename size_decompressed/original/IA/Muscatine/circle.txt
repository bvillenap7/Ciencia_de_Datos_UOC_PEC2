As I was watching the clear sky the objects appeared to blink on as if entering the atmosphere and heated up. There was a larger craft leading 5 or 6 wings of 3 of about one third the size. First they were viewed from above then made a turn upward and toward the north at which the bottom of the formation could be seen. As they continued they took a sharp angle upward and the top of the formation was again observed. The exit angle was at about 11 o-clock in the northwestern sky. The formation was approx. 6 times longer than it was wide. OOPS-----SEE above None of the characteristics below were observed.;41.4319;-91.0485
