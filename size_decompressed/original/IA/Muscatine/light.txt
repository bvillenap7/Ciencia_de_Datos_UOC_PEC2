five bright yellow lights leading huge craft;2011-10-20 21:15:00;3 min.;five bright yellow lights leading huge craft Looking to the south east three very bright lights appeared and moved slowly north west. They were following each other and then turned due east. Suddenly the first blinked out and the other two did the same. About the time the first three blinked out, two more appeared in the same location the first came from, now the count is five. The fourth and fifth were following the same route as the first three and they turned at the exact same location as the first, how do I know that? It was at the upper point of Andromeda. The last of the five was the most spectacular, it had the same bright yellow light as the first four but this light was suspended below the object and illuminated the craft above it. The craft above this light was round and it was huge, all I could see was the very bottom of the craft and it was light up by the light {same as the first four} directly below it...excuse this, but I had to laugh when I realized what I was hearing was myself saying.! ..WTF,WTF over and over again..it made me laugh...at me!;41.4319;-91.0485
Bright orange lights moving slow across the sky.;2011-11-05 19:00:00;>15 minutes;Bright orange lights moving slow across the sky. Six bright orange lights moving low across the sky.  Saw three.  Then another three.  Would stay bright for 3-5 minutes then would go dark.  Another light or two would then appear, move slowly across the sky, then dim out.  Went on for 15 minutes or more.;41.4319;-91.0485
Wandering white light flying north, while three red/white constant lights remained stationary;2012-06-05 23:10:00;3 to 4 minutes;Wandering white light flying north, while three red/white constant lights remained stationary The UFO sighting was witnessed over Muscatine, Iowa around 11:10 pm Tuesday June 5, 2012.  The first object seen was moving in a direct path towards the north at a constant speed. The object seemed to be moving in a wandering manner and moving somewhat fast but it did not seem to be in a hurry it almost looked like if it was surveying the sky.  The object was illusive, as it appeared to be a dot of light, almost as a planet would look like except that this light moved and it seemed way to large to be the light of an airplane or a planet.  The shape looked like an elongated sphere with three very faint and small lights on top lining up as if it was the tail of the aircraft or an antenna of some sort. There was no real sense of how fast it was really going and how far above from the ground it was traveling. There were also two or maybe three other lights that stood out from the rest of the stars. They were too large to be stars and maybe even to large to be planets. These lights were stationary and also had a reddish tone. My mother (The other witness) thought they seemed to also be elongated spheres of white light but with two faint and small spheres or dots of red light under the main and larger light sphere. I thought it seemed as if a faint and radiating light emerged from the objects to me, it looked like some kind of magnetic field or some kind of shield.;41.4319;-91.0485
Bright light in the sky.;2015-10-10 20:30:00;2-3 seconds;Bright light in the sky Sky was dark, I went outside to have a smoke. I walked around to the back of my apt. bldg. and looked up as I usually do. almost straight overhead, (I would say at about 85 deg.), I saw a light brighter and larger than any star I have ever seen. It was about 1/8th to 3/16ths of an inch held at arms length. Color was bright white. My first thought was Hello, what are you doing up there? As soon as that thought was complete, this light began to recede and shrink.  Within a second, or second and a half it had faded to match the faintest stars you could see.  Then it was gone. There were aircraft in the sky, but they showed no interaction with this light I saw other stars, planets in the area but noticed no indication of a shape behind this light.;41.4319;-91.0485
