It had twinkling blue lights around it.  At first, the object was very still.  It then began to move through the sky slowly, traveling east, it would stop periodically over the span of 5 minutes or so.   All of a sudden, the object accelerated very quickly so we had to move to another area of our house to keep observing it.   Once we were at the other area of our home, we saw the object disappear behind some clouds in the sky.;41.5663;-91.265
