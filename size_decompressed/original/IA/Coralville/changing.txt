On the evening of July 6, 2019, at around 1800 hours, I was doing a photoshoot with a model on the roof of a hotel in Coralville, Iowa.  I was primarily shooting to the northwest with a partly cloudy sky.  The goal of the shoot was to get the model with a nice cloudy background in the shots.   When I arrived home in Des Moines, Iowa, the next day, I noticed an unusual object on one of the frames.  As I began to look at more frames, I noticed the object was moving throughout several of the images.  I also noticed the object had a companion.  Both objects interacted with the clouds at their base.  For the most part, the objects were circular, but in the first few frames one of the objects had an oval shape with a pyramid shape within the oval.  Neither I, or the model, noticed the objects during the shoot.  I have enclosed a pdf file with several slides detailing the event.;41.6941;-91.5939
