I saw a black sphere travel for approximately 45 seconds in a completely straight line until out of sight. This was shortly after 11 AM and there were no lights on the object. It was quite far away from me. It was about the size size of an M&M held at arms length. I would guess that it was several miles away if not further. There were other commercial jets in the sky that I could compare it to. It was well below the cloud cover and other plane traffic lines.;41.6941;-91.5939
