Shortly after 9am I had noticed an oval object appearing to hover in the sky.  The sky was perfectly blue. There were two noticable commercial jets with exhaust trails within eye view of the oval object.  One could easily see wings off the commercial jets at the altitude they were flying.  The oval object appeared to be flying at a lower altitude, but there were no noticable protrusions from its smooth appearance.  When movement was noticed this crafts ability to cruise across the skyline appeared to be much faster than what the commercial jets were doing.;41.6941;-91.5939
a light and movement that I have never seen before;2006-05-22 21:35:00;1 sec;a light and movement that I have never seen before did not move like an aircraft, too fast, did not move like a meteorite, too slow, also was not bright, nor was it a pinpoint, it was oval and was arrayed with the appearance of several lights....no sound at all, it came out of the SE and was moving NW, it also appeared very low in the sky,  I felt like it was only a few hundred feet up, but that did not make sense because it was too small not to be of great distance.;41.6941;-91.5939
