Coming fast from the south, we saw a bright round orange/yellowish light with an outer red light all the way around it.  There weren't any blinking lights like a plane.  It was moving very fast and made no sounds which was odd because it appeared somewhat close to us or at least it seemed like it in the night sky.  It continued moving straight north and then jUSt seemed to disappear.;41.6635;-90.5634
