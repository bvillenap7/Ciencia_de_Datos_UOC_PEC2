Small triangle shaped lights moving through sky.;2008-07-07 21:20:00;30-60 seconds;Small triangle shaped lights moving through sky. Saw three small white lights in shape of triangle. 2 or 3 small red lights were in the middle of the triangle, or on its edges. Since it was night, it just looked like lights in the shape of a triangle. It stayed above a gas station, not moving. It looked like it was a small craft. Only 15 feet long maybe. It was about 50 yards high in the air. After about 30 seconds of just floating above the gas station it started moving North-Northwest. It wasn't going very fast, maybe 30 mph. It then went out of sight above the tops of houses. No sound like a helicopter, but floated and moved slowly so it couldn't have been a plane.;41.6635;-90.5634
Triangle UFO over farmhouse and trees on Utica Ridge Road, towards Eldridge, Iowa;2012-06-26 23:45:00;5 minutes;Triangle UFO over farmhouse and trees on Utica Ridge Road, towards Eldridge, Iowa As I was driving home after work, I was blinded by a bright beam in the sky ahead of me so I but my brights on.  The next second the beam changed to a white light.  At the time I thought it was a helicopter.  I kept driving towards it, and saw it had a blue and red flashing lights.  When I approached it, I stopped the car to take a picture, only to figure out my camera wasn't in the car, so I don't have proof.  It was a VERY HUGE triangle with one blue, one red, and one white light on each points, silently hovering  approximately two hundred feet over some trees, and a farmhouse on the south side of the road, directly on my left. It stayed there silent and motionless, but I became to scared to stick around so I started driving again.;41.6635;-90.5634
