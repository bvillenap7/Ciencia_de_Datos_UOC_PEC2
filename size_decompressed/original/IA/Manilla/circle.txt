2 Red lights seen over small Iowa town, then disappeared!;2017-07-08 22:10:00;10 seconds;2 Red lights seen over small Iowa town, then disappeared! Around 10:10 pm just outside of Manilla, IA, 3 of 4 family members saw large red lights in the sky.  I said, “What are those lights?  Manilla doesn’t have lights like that!?”  The 2 lights were high in the air, spaced apart.  They reminded me of tower lights, but there are no towers there (in the area that we saw the lights).  1 family member thought the lights were moving down, I believe I only saw one light (right side) move down.  After a few seconds they disappeared!   The lights were too big I believe to be a drone.  While we were driving we were listening to the radio, when we drove on the road into town, the music on the radio was interrupted by the Emergency Broadcast Alert System (made the loud sounds), but it had no message and went back to music.;41.8917;-95.2384
