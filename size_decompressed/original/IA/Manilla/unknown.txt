Heading North on US Highway 59 near Manilla, Iowa. Looking into the Northwest skies I observed 1 extremely bright gold light staying still,as I kept driving North 5 more bright gold lights appeard, from left to right,all right after the other. After  all 6 objects were alluminated in a perfectly straight line (West to East) they all disapeard in about 30 seconds and nothing more. After they were gone I  pulled off the road and got out to see if I could see or hear any planes but I didn't..and then a very bright flash of white light appeard, I jumped into my car and raced off I've never been so scared in my entire life. The hair on the back of my neck is still on end,by the way their were no storms out either. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));41.8917;-95.2384
