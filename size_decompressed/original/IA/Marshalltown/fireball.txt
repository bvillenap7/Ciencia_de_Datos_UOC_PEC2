Orange/red light seen on west side of town.;2017-07-06 22:00:00;10 seconds;Orange/red light seen on west side of town. It was 10:00 p.m, on the west side of town near Casey's gas station on Lincoln Way.  As I was driving, I noticed a large orange/red ball of light in the sky heading south at a fast speed, there was visible stars & no obstructions near, the light was very intense and it didn't seem to be too high up in the sky,   I kept my eye on the light and it eventually got dimmer & completely disappeared within about 10 seconds.;42.0405;-92.9127
