To my left, (east) moving slowly from left to right (north to south) a black triangular shaped object was flying over the Hy Vee Store.  There was a single row of 5-6 round green lights on two sides of the triangle, underneath the object, forming a V pattern.  The lights were not pulsating or rotating.  I could see the object's shape clearly, as the glow from the Hy Vee parking lot lights illuminated the object from below. It was a dull black against a clear black sky and the stars were visible.  Although I could hear noise from the air conditioning system and traffic noises from Center Street, I did not hear any noise from the object.  Within 4 or 5 seconds, we lost sight of the object behind the trees near the theater.  I asked the actor if he had seen anything and he answered in the affirmative.  I asked if he had seen anything like that before and he said he hadn't.  I asked him to describe it to me and he did, much as I describe it here.  We were too stunned to run out past the trees to follow it further.  Neither of us had ever seen anything like it before, although we both agreed it was similar to the Stealth aircraft we had seen on television programs.  I am a community college professor and am rather skeptical of UFO sightings.  I like proof.  I do not know what this object was, but would like to find out.;42.0405;-92.9127
