They seemed to react to each other the way that mercury does in its liquid form.;2007-01-15 15:00:00;hour;I witnessed several shapes in the sky that seem to have been ufo's.I sat watching these shapes for over an hour. They seemed to look almost like orbs or silverish bubbles at first. But they would dip and dive and approach another larger shape that was more cigar shaped and just melt into it.Then after a moment or two would reappear from the longer one. At first I had thought that they might have been balloons. But after watching them it was pretty obvious that they were something else.They were far to large to be balloons,and they seemed to react to each other the way that mercury does in its liquid form.  Sort of running into one another and becoming absorbed.It was very exciting to watch and I am still unable to identify these objects.;42.0405;-92.9127
