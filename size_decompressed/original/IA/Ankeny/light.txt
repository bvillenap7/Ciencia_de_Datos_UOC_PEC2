My mother pointed towards the north telling me to look at the sky.  When I looked, I saw a solid orange light that was moving from west to east.  It was bright, but didn't appear to have any other colored lights.  The object slowed down to almost a hover, turned to the north and quickly disappeared. For my mother, this was her first time seeing anything like this.  This is not the first time I've seen this light though.  I have seen this same kind of light about half a dozen times now over the past year, even though I have moved about 40 miles away.  They always appear between evening and dusk, and it's always just 1.  There has never been any sound with them, and they appear to make a 90 degree turn and disappear quickly.  The speed varies from fast to almost a hover, but every time they turn, they speed off.;41.7152485981308;-93.6027542056074
