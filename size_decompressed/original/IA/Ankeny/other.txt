Brilliant white object over Ankeny, IA, moving to the north /northeast;2020-07-15 21:47:00;5 minutes;Brilliant white object over Ankeny Iowa, moving to the north /northeast Conditions were very clear. I was in my back yard looking to the south.  I then noticed a bright object approaching from the south, moving to the north and then curing to the northeast.  I could not make out a shape.  The object only appeared to be a very bright, a very brilliant white light.  As it approached directly over head.  It appeared to slow down and almost stop.  It redirected course to the east. In this sense it did not behave like a satellite.  There was some minor cloud cover to the east and as the craft entered the area of clouds, it seemed to dim.  Giving the impression that it was above the clouds.  The object made no sound.;41.7152485981308;-93.6027542056074
