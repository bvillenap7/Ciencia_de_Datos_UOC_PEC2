White spherical flying object seen flying East at a steady fast pace.;2014-03-15 22:00:00;10 minutes;White spherical flying object seen flying East at a steady fast pace. I was getting into my car when I looked up and saw the UFO.  The object was oddly shaped, almost like an upside down cone and colored white.   The object flew at a steady fast pace east in the sky and was bright like a star.  It was not a falling star as it was not going extremely fast.  It moved as if it had thought.   The object eventually disappeared out of the sky and could no longer be seen.;41.7152485981308;-93.6027542056074
