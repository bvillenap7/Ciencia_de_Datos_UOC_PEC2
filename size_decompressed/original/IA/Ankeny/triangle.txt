Triangular shaped craft (20-30ftlength of side) with a light at each corner, hovered motionless 40-50feet over a farmhouse.;2000-09-26 22:10:00;One minute;Triangular shaped craft (20-30ftlength of side) with a light at each corner, hovered motionless 40-50feet over a farmhouse. I was driving on Hwy 35 north from Ankeny Iowa to Ames. About 5-7 miles north of Ankeny I casually looked over to the right side of the road at what appeared to be a farmhouse. As I was approaching the farmhouse I saw what looked like lights for the farmhouse but as I approached the farmhouse I saw something that looked nothing like a typical pole light. First no light was illuminating any kind of pole that would be holding it up. Second I saw that the three lights were unusually distant from each other(about 20-30ft?)and arranged in a perfect triangle. Also the lights were higher than nearby oak or elm trees leading me to think that it was about 40-50ft high above ground. but the most astonishing detail was that the lights didn't appear to be pointing strait down but rather out and down at an angle. This allowed some kind of surface around the light to be illuminated, showing the outline of the craft.;41.7152485981308;-93.6027542056074
TRIANGLE FORMATION LIGHTS OVER CHURCH ANKENY, IOWA;2011-07-14 02:00:00;3 minutes;TRIANGLE FORMATION LIGHTS OVER CHURCH ANKENY, IOWA We were driving along the highway at 2 a.m. on a Saturday morning.  We were driving a 2001 Ford Taurus.  I looked to my left and there was a church on the lower level street.  I then looked above the church and saw what looked to be about 50 to 100 feet in the air, three golden lights in a triangle formation hovering and rotating counter clockwise.  After a few seconds of witnessing this strange phenomenon, I saw grey spheres begin to form around the lights, and I started to fade in vision and found myself looking at the floor of the car.  The driver and passenger assumed it would be a good idea to instead of stopping the car to drive to the nearest exit and get on the opposite side of the highway to get a closer look.  By the time we came to the other side of the highway, the lights were gone.  All three of us got out of the car and tried to collect ourselves.  I looked to the parking lot and I saw an SUV pull into the parking lot of the church with the light! s off, and what looked like a husband and wife get out.   The husband had a video camera but the lights were gone.   Also, on the highway there was a man who seemed baffled at the incident as much as we did.  There were no other cars on the highway.   We then drove home with no other suspicious activity. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));41.7152485981308;-93.6027542056074

Amber lit triangle passes above Ankeny,IA.;2014-10-21 00:10:00;05 seconds;Amber lit triangle passes above Ankeny,IA. I was sitting out on my back deck watching the meteor shower that was just starting in my area.  This was at 12:10am on the 21 of October. As I was laying on my back looking up at the stars I seen a movement, or blur.  It was a faint gray streak or something. I'm not sure.  As I was looked I noticed a very dim amber light, as I focused more I seen 9-10 very dim amber lights in the shape of a &gt.I couldn't believe what I had seen so I sat up, and watched it pass through the sky right above me. As I sat in disbelief, I listened for any noises that might follow what I just seen.  Nothing followed.  Not a single peep of noise.  The lights passed by pretty quickly, lasting about 5-6 seconds. It seemed to very close, or very large.  But no noise at all. Just smooth steady and fast!;41.7152485981308;-93.6027542056074
