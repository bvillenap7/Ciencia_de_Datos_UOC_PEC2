Two slow moving star-like objects suddenly accelerated to light speed heading towards Jupiter;2013-10-11 06:13:00;2 minutes;two slow moving star-like objects suddenly accelerated to light speed heading towards Jupiter I was outside in the early morning while it was still dark. I was stargazing, admiring Orion standing brightly in the sky.  Suddenly, I saw an object that looked like a star moving through the constellation at a very fast speed, about fighter jet speed, but much higher in the sky and it was a very clear, non-flashing, constant light, about the same luminosity as the stars in Orion. At first I assumed it was a satellite, but then to my amazement I saw another star moving at the same speed in the same direction, but several seconds behind the first. At this moment I went to get my telescope, but I couldn't get it focused on the objects in the sky. I looked back up with my naked eyes, and I just managed to catch  in time the second object accelerate at a massive speed towards the east, from Orion towards Jupiter. It might have been two satellites flying over rural Iowa followed by a shooting star originating from the exact same position in the sky,  But I'll be damned of it didn't look like a spaceship cruising across orbit lazily before blasting into light speed towards Jupiter.  I hope it was just a coincidence of satellites and a shooting star, but after I saw the acceleration streak I was unable to relocate either of the satellite-looking objects.;41.7152485981308;-93.6027542056074
