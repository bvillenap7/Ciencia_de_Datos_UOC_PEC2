Black v shape  no sound  verry slow and low;1983-08-15 21:00:00;3 hours;Black v shape  no sound  verry slow and low   In 1983, a friend and I were camping in a gully behind my house.  The house was north of us about a 1/4 of a mile.  At around 9:00 pm we saw a shape moving in the sky to the north west of my house. It moved over my house at around 200 feet above the ground and slowly and moved towards our spot that we were camping. No sound no wind just a very large v shape.  One bright white light on each end one on the front. We ran to the top of the gully that open to a field and stood to watch it go over head. Then noticed circles of light on the ground I donâ€™t remember too much after the lights got close to me. Then the next clear thing I remember was watching it leave to the east.  I was standing under a small tree and my friend was standing by the fence line about 80 feet from me which was where  we had been right beside each other  and the craft was a 1/4 mile from us going a different direction . We ran back to the house after going to put out the fire that we had started for camp but it was burnt out.  When we got to the house it was after midnight but it just seemed like it had been not that long that it was only 9:00 pm ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
