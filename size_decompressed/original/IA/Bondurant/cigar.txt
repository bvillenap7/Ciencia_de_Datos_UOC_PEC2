Was silent and traveled at a high rate of speed and  in a straight line.  Height was approximately 15 degees into the horizon. Size fit into the space between my right index finger and thumb at its closest point to me. Clearly seen for approximately 4 minutes. Attempted to follow west into Des Moines.  Lost sight due to obstructed views and distance. Could not identify colors as I am color deficient red/green. I am a former Deputy Sheriff and long time former  criminal investigator on the civilian side.;41.7057;-93.4431
