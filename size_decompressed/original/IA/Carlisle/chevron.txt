Green Chevron Shaped Craft Drops from Sky and Disappears;2001-10-28 01:20:00;5 Seconds;Green Chevron Shaped Craft Drops from Sky and Disappears I and anothar person was travelling down Highway 65 South outside of Carlise, Iowa, which is near Des Moines.  To the east of out car we saw a green chevron shaped craft rapidly drop out of the sky and then disappear.  It looked as if an airplan was crashing into a cornfield except the craft was an electric green and fell extremely fast and then disappeared before it hit the ground.  A few minutes later there seemed to be a ball of light which changed from green to red to blue to white that was larger than a star and distant in the sky that seemed as if it was watching the area.;41.4814;-93.4921
