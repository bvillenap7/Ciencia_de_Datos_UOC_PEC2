Disk-shaped object seen above treeline;2012-08-02 23:18:00;2 minutes;disk shaped object seen above treeline I was taking my dog out for a walk. My friend, who I was accompanied by, had noticed a disk shaped object about 50 yards in diameter and very thin that seemed to be &quothovering&quot above the tree line, about 150 - 200 yards away from the town high school. It looked as if it was spinning clockwise from where we were standing. he object had green and bright white lights located othn the very edge of it. My friend tried to take his iPhone out to capture a video image of the object, but his suddenly froze and went to a blank white screen. My dog started barking then ran home. The disk then preceded to light up or glow with a powerful and extremely bright white light and in a flash or within less than a second or two it disappeared and was not seen again.
