Strange lights running into eachother breaking off into more lights.;2003-05-30 22:00:00;15 minutes;Strange lights running into eachother breaking off into more lights. My friend was having a party, with a bon fire out in the country inbetween Glenwood, Iowa and Bellevue, Nebraska.  Their were 3 of us kids (15 yrs old at the time) outside, and two adults when suddenly I noticed that there were strange blue lights that sort of looked like shooting stars in the sky.  I told the rest of the people to look up and we were all amazed. One of the adults told us that it was probably just something from Offut Air Force Base, and to just forget about it, but it was to amazing for us to quit looking at. The lights were running into eachother breaking off into many other lights and created large circular shapes in the sky. After about 10 minutes of this occuring, I over heard the adults talking to eachother saying that the lights were starting to creep them out. Me and one of my friends rushed inside because we had a weird feeling that this would be on the news or something talking about an alien invasion, so we skipped through all of the channels and were suprised to see that it was not on t.v. We rushed back out there and suddenly the lights stopped.  Everyone who was ouside decided to come inside as it was starting to get a little chilly.  Every few minutes we would look outside to see if the lights came back, and around 5 minutes after the lights disappeard, strange beam like lights flashed from the ground up to the sky every few seconds. This stopped after 2-3 minutes and that was the last of the lights that we saw.  I am VERY sure that what I saw that night was from a different planet as no aircraft that I have ever heard of runs into eachother.
