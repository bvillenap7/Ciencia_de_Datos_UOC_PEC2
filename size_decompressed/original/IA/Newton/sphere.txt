Large light in southwest sky;1999-07-06 20:30:00;less than minute;Large light in southwest sky Two of us were walking at 8:30 in the evening.  We spotted this hugh light in the southwest sky.  Being curious as to what it was, we watched it for 10 to 15 seconds and it just hung in the sky.  There was an airplane up in the sky well above this light and we could see a very short con trail.  As we continued to watch the light our view was blocked by trees in the area.  When we walked farther we could again spot the object.  It just seemed to hoover in the same place.  I don't believe it moved up or down or side to side.  We again came to an area where we couldn't see the object, and when our view was again clear to see it, it was gone.  my best opinion of the time was that we had it in view approximately 1 minute.  I tuned in to Art Bell that evening after we had seen it, and it was either that night or the next that he told of a pilot comming from Minnesota that had seen a large light while he was flying his airplane.  I often wondered if we had seen the same light.;41.6892;-93.0533999999999
