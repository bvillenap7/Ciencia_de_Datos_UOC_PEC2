A bright light just appeared.;2015-08-06 23:15:00;45 seconds;A bright light just appeared. We were riding East on Rt.80 around mile marker 168 when the 3 of us saw a light just appear in the sky.  I kept my eye on it.   When I got under it there were 5 big lights at each corner most were clear some were blue.   We were on motorcycles, so we don't know if it made noise.  I watched it as long as I could.   Nothing happened while I watched.   It must not have been moving, because we got closer to it.  It wasn't moving our way.;41.6892;-93.0533999999999
