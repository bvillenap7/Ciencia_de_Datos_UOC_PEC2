Red dots  in mid air;2006-05-14 01:32:00;about 10 mins;Red dots  in mid air Morning of May 14, 2006 (05/14/06) Sunday it was a cold morning and a full moon.  Around 1:20 Am driving on a gravel road with a friend of mine.  A single red dot with a red light appeared in mid air on the the left hand side in a field  (The height was about where a telephone wire would be).  It would disappear and another one would appear down the road always on the left hand side up in mid air in the field.  After, the 3rd one appeard, I stopped my car in the middle of the gravel road.  Now 1:32 am   Within seconds shooting from the right side  of the field was like a  big group of the lights appears to be red dots side by side with two columns of them with four total objects in each column.  There seemed to be a lighter red haze around these red light objects. They swooped over the road about 30 to 35  yards in front of my car.  They had speed on them.  Then down the ditch and straight up into the air and disappeared.  They had to go straight up because there was a hill in the field.  But they didnt go over it they just disappeared in mid air.  Right in front of our eyes.;41.6892;-93.0533999999999
Red dots in the sky;2006-05-14 01:45:00;10 minutes;Red dots in the sky We were traveling in a car and I saw a bright red dot about 35 yards away. At first I thought I was seeing things so I paid no attention to it then I saw another one. At that time I asked the other person in the car if they saw it and she said yes and we were asking eachother what it was when we saw another one. At that time I told her to stop the car and as soon as she did there were about twelve more side by side. When they appeared the started on the right side of the car and then swooped down and then back up and disappeared always in the same pattern.;41.6892;-93.0533999999999
