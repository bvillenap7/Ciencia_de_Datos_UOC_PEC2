shooting star which stopped and suddenly shot upward;2004-12-23 04:20:00;5 seconds;shooting star which stopped and suddenly shot upward I am a red cross worker who was traveling from Omaha to Afton Iowa early on the 23rd of December to supervise a blood drive. Traveling East on Hwy 34 at approximately Malvern IA, I witnessed what at first appeared to be a shooting star in my peripheral vision. My eyes followed it and at approximately 25 degrees from the horizon it suddenly stopped and shot upward at about 45 degrees and then disappeared. Though I don't really believe in UFOs I can't possibly imagine what kind of aircraft would produce this type of flight. P.S. It had a red light upon its flight path upward.;41.0044;-95.5916
