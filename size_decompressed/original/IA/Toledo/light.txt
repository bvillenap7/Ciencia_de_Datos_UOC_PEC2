Lights circling over Iowa.;2013-07-24 21:35:00;15;Lights circling over Iowa. Ok this is a freaky and true story:  We decided to have a hot dog roast tonight so my brother started a little fire out back. We were telling stories and such then all of a sudden Willie was looking in the sky... The sun had gone down by now and the stars were bright .... He was saying look.at that plane... And telling us where to look .... Pretty soon we were all looking up and just to the northeast of where we were sitting we saw this plane and we watched it go past this bright star... Except it wasn't a star.... It was a bright light but it was going in circles....not rotating but moving in circles.... Soon another light appeared beside the rotating light and started moving away!!!!!!  I tried to capture with my phone but its no good in the dark.... My bro took out his binoculars and we could see the light moving to the south and it had two smaller companions beside it moving in the same fashion.  Idk if the plane that passed by it noticed it or not but it was freaky.;42.0103;-92.5689
