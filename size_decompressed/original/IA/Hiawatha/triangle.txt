In the western skies of eastern Iowa I noticed a small object (yet very bright compared to stars. I would almost characterize the light as a dim LED) slowly moving across the night sky.  After a longer look at the object (and witnessing several planes fly past the point in the sky), I decided to grab my binoculars (4x30) and a few witnesses.  My mother, step-father and girlfriend were all witness to this object.   Through the binoculars, the object was CLEARLY visible.  A triangle, with bright, multi-colored lights that traced up to the top point of the triangle, repeating.  After further observation, a ring, with the same light characteristics traced around the base of the triangle in a circle (counter-clockwise). The object's movement is what made it so interesting.  From a fixed point on the ground (a tree), you can see the object move, slowly and at different speeds in one direction, then in another direction. Either up, down, left or right. This object was clearly visible for 2 or 3 hours before vanishing.  It has re-appeared at later dates, the same size, shape and light pattern are visible and within the same timeframe. This object is clearly visible from any point on Tower Terrace Rd. (in Hiawatha) and tends to 'hover' above Interstate-380. The object was either too small or not bright enough to produce a quality photo/video. Hopefully this encourages someone else in the area to keep their eyes up.
