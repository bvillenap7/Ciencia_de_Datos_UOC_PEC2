Itâ€™s angle of descent was only about 15 to 20 degrees and it appeared about 45 degrees above the horizon.   Though it appeared to be only 3 - 5 miles away at most, it produced no noticeable sound.   From the moment we noticed it until the moment that the fireball flared brighter white, as if bursting, and then disappearing, totaled about 10 seconds.
