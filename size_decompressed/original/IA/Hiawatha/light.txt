The object firstly seemed to be standing still, but then started moving really slowly across the sky, at an altitude that seemed to be very high, compared to a regular aircraft, it was practically double the height.  It appeared as an extremely bright light, sometimes as if it was blinking, moving towards northeast Iowa.    We were standing in our balcony for nearly half an hour, here in Hiawatha, Iowa.;42.0403;-91.6813
