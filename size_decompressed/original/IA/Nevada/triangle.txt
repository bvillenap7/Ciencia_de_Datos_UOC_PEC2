It looked like a V-Formation that birds fly in. Except the birds in this case I believe were actually lights. There were 3 on one side and 4 on the other and they were not super bright, in fact they were barely a lighter shade of illuminated gray than the night sky it self. The lights were kind of frosty/blurry looking. More a brighter shade of gray than yellow or white or red. They were not flashing. This thing floated effortlessly, and reminded me of how paper would be if it were floating, just really light and smooth.;42.0161;-93.444
