With long glowing tail traveling behind seem to be descending out of the sky headed in a west to east direction.  Object moved at tremendous speed and dissapeared into the east horizon. We were backing out of our lane to our aunt's funeral visitation.  Our eleven year old daughter looked out the back window of the car and said, Look! Look! Look at that!.  My wife and I turned and witnessed a single large fireball traveling in an easterly direction out the side window of our car.  It was round and what appeared to be a tail of burning gas traveling behind.  It was blue, green, and orange in color.   We watched it as it dissapeared on the eastern horizon in approximately 15 seconds.  It appeared to be a huge object traveling in the sky at the height of a low airplane.   I am a construction foreman, my wife homeschools our daughter and we live 2 and a half miles north of town in a rental farmhouse.;41.6145;-90.91
