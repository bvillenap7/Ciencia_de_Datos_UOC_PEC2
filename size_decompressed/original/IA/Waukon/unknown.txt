Triangular/V-shape UFO spotted over North East Iowa.;2010-07-31 22:00:00;5 mins;Triangular/ V-shape UFO spotted over North East Iowa. At about 9:45 p.m. central time, my dad and I were driving from Cresco, IA, to Marquette, IA, as we tend to do every other weekend.  When we got through Waukon, IA, we noticed 4 bright lights...three of which were PEACH size and color, and the other bright red.  The bottom light was peach, and the next one was red...as we thought we were looking at a light tower that had been tipped at 45 degrees to the right...though we knew no towers were there.   Then we noticed 2 more peach lights above that... the heighth from the ground unknown.  The 4 lights moved TOGETHER and kept a common onterval...seeming as if it were one object.   To me it looked as if it were a triangle shape... or closed V- shape.  The opening of the V was pointed West and the point, as it were, was to the East.  The object was moving very rapidly to the North West very rapidly.  I'd have to say 5 times faster than a normal 747 would...maybe faster, as it was only visible for 5 mins... at first it didn't seem to move, for 5 mins, and then all of a sudden, this whole thing shot off to the North West.   I can try to submit a drawing of what we saw if desired.;43.2606;-91.483
