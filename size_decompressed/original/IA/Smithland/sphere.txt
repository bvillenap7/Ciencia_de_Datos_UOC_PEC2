bright blue sphere near Smithland, IA;2008-02-19 19:10:00;2 min;bright blue sphere near Smithland, IA I saw a blue light to the south of the highway.  It was a ways away so I thought it may be an emergency vehicle on a gravel road.  As I was nearing the hill, the blue light got closer.  In the blink of an eye it went directly over the top of me.  It was so bright, I could not see out of my car!  All of the lights on my car went out including my headlights and all interior lights just for a second but my car engine did not stall.  It was going from south to north, when I looked to the north to see where it went, it was gone.  I have seen other objects near this same area, I don't know if it is a hot spot or I am just so special I get to see all these things.;42.2408;-95.9448
