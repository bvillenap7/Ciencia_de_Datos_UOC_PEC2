One rotating blade (but rotated very, very slow). No sound.;2012-09-27 15:30:00;10 minutes;One rotating blade ( but rotated very, very slow). No sound. I saw an object moving 3,000 to 4,000 ft in the air moving 15-50 MPH To the NW.  No wind at all at my location.  Object appeared to have one revolving blade (like a helicopter).  It rotated so slow that I could watch the blade rotate.  It was not a helicopter.  No noise, and it should have fallen straight down due to the slow speed.  I was on top of a grain bin at the time I saw it.;42.6118;-94.1419
