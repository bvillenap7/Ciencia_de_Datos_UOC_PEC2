Triangular craft moving very fast in odd directions.;2010-09-07 02:30:00;120;Triangular craft moving very fast in odd directions. At 2:30 am I looked to the sky and noticed a large triangular shaped light.  The Light moved in a zig-zag pattern then quickly went from the western sky to the southern sky.   I had my girlfriend come outside to look at it and it stayed in the southern sky for about 25 minutes.  It went from close up to far away and made small movements.   I recorded video's and took some pictures with my phone.;40.9623;-91.5613
