Large green/red fireball over Lamoni, IA viewed from Graceland University.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a bright meteor.  PD));2010-04-14 22:05:00;10 seconds;Large green/red fireball over Lamoni, IA viewed from Graceland University On April 14, 2010, as I left my campus library and looked up into the sky, I saw a bright green light (with a red head) appear maybe halfway up into the sky and then fall down, all the way down to what appeared to be the ground beyond where I could see at a rather moderate speed.  I was able to watch it for about 10 seconds give or take as it fell, and noticed the apparent size of the object from my distance meant it could not have been terribly far away---my best guess being it fell somewhere beyond campus in the fields beyond.  I should note that this was at night of course, and my sense of distance could have been skewed, but that object was pretty bright and appeared large from my viewpoint. My first impression was it could have been a lone stray firework, but as I studied it, my impression was that of a fireball.  As the object fell, I saw the clouds off in the distance reflect the red light as the red/green fireball fell past them.  The only other thing I noticed as I observed it was my best guess at its distance from me, as stated above. After it fell beyond where I could see, I thought about it and decided it was interesting, but probably nothing.  But of course, curiosity got the better of me.  I have heard and read about flares or fireballs before, so I decided to post my sighting on here. This observation occurred on April 14, 2010, around 10:05 pm (CST), from the campus of Graceland University in Lamoni, IA. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found him to be quite eloquent and serious-minded.  We suspect that the object was a typical bright meteor.  PD));40.6188;-93.9301
