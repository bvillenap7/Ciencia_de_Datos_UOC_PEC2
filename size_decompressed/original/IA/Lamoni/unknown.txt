My son was playing football.  When I was videoing him running for a touchdown I got excited and started yelling, forgot I was taping and the picture I was capturing was everywhere.  In one part I had the camera pointed in the sky.  An object flew over the field and it was captured on my camera.  The object was going to fast for a bird.  I did not know it was there until I played the video on my computer.  I have it saved on my computer.;40.6188;-93.9301
