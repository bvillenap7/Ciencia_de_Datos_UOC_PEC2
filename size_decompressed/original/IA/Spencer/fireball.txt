Lasted only a few seconds. My friend Emile and myself were going home after work and while driving north through Spencer, IA on US Highway 71, we suddenly saw a bright blueish green colored fireball with a long redish colored tail moving from the west to a northeast direction.  Having grown up in the wideopen spaces of western Nebraska, I have seen many falling stars, but never have I seen anything as large and differently colored as this.  Both my friend and myself were startled and commented to each other that we had never seen anything like that before.  We both thought it was just a meteor but both marveled at the size and color of it. I guess I never gave it a second thought until one night your director was on the Art Bell radio show the other night talking about recent sightings.  He told about the fireballs being reported and the color descriptions matched what I saw so I thought I would look up your sight and let you know what we saw.  I would appreciate it if someone would get back to me and let me know what I might have seen that night.  I have never seen any flying saucers or any other strange things except for this.  I am curious to learn what it was.;43.1489;-95.147
