(perhaps one huge object with lights at corners)  The lights were white and glowed steady with no colors or blinking.  The distance between the lights was about the width of a full moon.  After several minutes they just faded away and were nowhere to be seen.  Odd and disorienting they were definitely not planes. ((NUFORC Note:  Space Shuttle w/ ISS??  PD));43.1489;-95.147
