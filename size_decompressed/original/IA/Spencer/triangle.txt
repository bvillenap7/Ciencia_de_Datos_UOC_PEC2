I was waiting at the Walmart store in town and looked up. There was not a star in the sky. I noticed a white light in the sky. I started to watch it and it moved like being blowen in the wind. I went about my business. Headed home that night live 12 miles north and 5 miles east of Spencer and I looked up and here was a white lighted trianglar object in the sky only lower. It was quite bright. I turned five miles down the road and pulled into my farm and when I got out there it was. So I went into the house and looked out the window and it was still in the same spot. All I could see was a very white lighted object. Large and not moving now. It just set in the sky. I don't know what it was but I do know that it didn't move after that. Hopefully, someone else from Spencer has seen this so they can share their experiance.;43.1489;-95.147
