The first witness noticed a flashing red light in the western horizon at approximately 21:15. Initially thought it was a planet because of the red color.  Passed it off as a star and didn’t say anything to anyone in the party. Next witness brought attention to a red, white, and blue alternating colored light that appeared to dance above the tree line.  There were seven of us sitting around a campfire and we moved farther out into the yard to look closer. We got a pair of binoculars out and took turns reporting to each other what we saw.  Each of us saw a circular pattern of multi-colored lights that erratically moved while seemingly changing shapes.  Two of us described it to look like a Ferris Wheel in the sky or what Hollywood has depicted as a UFO in several movies. One witness documented the times and duration of appearance and disappearances as follows:  Started 21:15 to 21:39 very bright, distinct and vivid rotation could be observed.  It was at its highest point.  Also during this time period, 4 people witnessed what appeared to be a shooting star in the same general area. 21:39-21:45 Object disappeared from view. 21:45-22:01 Object reappeared, lower in the sky, appearing farther north somewhat less vivid. Telescope was used to tract objects movement. It was obvious that the object was moving by the way it moved from the center of the telescope’s viewfinder within seconds. Another shooting star was witnessed by all seven of us. One witness was viewing the lights through the binoculars when it just vanished. 22:01-22:06 Object wasn’t visible. 22:06-22:12 Lights reappeared, even lower but still visible. During this time five witnesses saw a flash of white light appear above the object. The object didn’t appear to be moving as much as it had been earlier and the light appeared more amber in color. 22:12 Lights disappeared;43.1489;-95.147
