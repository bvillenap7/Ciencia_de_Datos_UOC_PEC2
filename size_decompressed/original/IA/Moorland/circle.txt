I live in the country miles from any town.  I was just looking up in the sky and saw a circular light that caught my eye because it was moving slow and appeared to slightly  zig zag.  It had no marker lights just a single white light.   It flew over and it didn't go far past me and went straight up and disappeared in about two seconds.  I am a 35 year aircraft maintenance technician, and have never seen anything like this.;42.4341;-94.3217
