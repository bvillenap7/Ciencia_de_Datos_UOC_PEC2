Looked like an extra bright star.  But through binoculars I could see there was a bright white light in the center with several lights around the outside edge forming a circle. The object would turn a little, and it would turn oval.  Then a couple of times it looked like something was partially in front of it.  Something black that blocked part of itself and you could see no glare.  There were 2 like this  and possibly one other farther off that was a blinking white haze.  They were hanging out trying to look like stars.  This was in the south sky and I know for a fact they weren't stars or planets.;40.9928;-92.1458
