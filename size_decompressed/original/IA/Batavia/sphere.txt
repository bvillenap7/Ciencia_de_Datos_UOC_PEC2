A UFO was seen to the north of our house.;2010-02-28 06:00:00;15 minutes;A UFO was seen to the north of our house. On Sunday, February 28, 2010 at approximately 6:00 a.m. my father reported seeing a ufo.  He described it as being a large white light in the sky just above a telephone pole to the north of our house.  The light looked much like a regular star in the sky but much more prominent than the other stars.  When my father viewed the light through a pair of binoculars, it appeared to be a light composed of about 7 to 9 smaller lights.  To the left of this large light was another smaller light.  Suddenly, the light started to move up and toward the south, right over our house. The light was the only thing that could be seen throughout this entire ordeal.  No craft could be completely seen through this light.  As the light moved toward our house, it moved with the speed of a regular airplane.  It was also noted that 2 small lights were blinking under the main light, in sequential order.  After the light moved over our house it continued traveling south until in could no longer be seen.;40.9928;-92.1458
