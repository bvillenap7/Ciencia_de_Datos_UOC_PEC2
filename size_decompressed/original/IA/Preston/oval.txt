Blue oval shaped transparent light  w/o an apparent source with red lights flashing around it.;2003-12-26 20:00:00;15 Minutes;Blue oval shaped transparent light  w/o an apparent source with red lights flashing around it. My cousin and I were looking for something to do so we decided to go on a road trip.  We were traveling north in Iowa from our homes, and were driving for about 55 minutes through some remote areas that I was familiar with.  Between the towns of Springbrook and Preston we noticed a strange light off to the left of our vehicle in a field. The light was an odd blue oval shape. The light appeared to have no source, and looked transparent. The light also seemed to have a smoky quality, but there was no smoke moving. I noticed a small red light flash near the road (which was much closer to the car than the blue light). We also saw identical lights in and around the blue light. The red lights were very dimm, except for the one next to the road. We circled around a 3 times and it was in the same place and we saw the same red lights. We then drove back to our and discussed the matter, and concluded there was no reasonable explanation for what we saw.;42.0533;-90.3901
