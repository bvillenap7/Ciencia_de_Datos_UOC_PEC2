East south east of my location. Low on the horizon.  Flashing or strobing bright lights.  No regular pattern.  Bright red at times with what appeared to be a  dimmer green or blue green light below and to its left.  Third time I've witnessed in as many weeks.  Light will move short distances and then return.  Called friend who lives app 7 miles distant in same direction.  He reported light as blue green and located almost directly overhead or to the west a short distance. Two other witnesses who live 7 to 8 miles west of object traveled to area to view object at same time.  Objects seem to hover and appear to be much higher in altitude than allowed by law.;43.0573;-92.952
