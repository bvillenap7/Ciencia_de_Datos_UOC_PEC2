A round with blue and red lights slowly moved across the sky. Dec. 25, 2006 at approximately 8:45 p.m. at Rockford, Iowa, I recieved a phone call to look at an object in the sky, which they were observing through a telescope. My son, daughter-in-law and I curiously watched through our binoculars. I took several photos, being so dark out, only a few showed the object clearly. The object appeared to be round (which shows in the enlarged photo) with blue and red lights. It didn't move very fast, yet did move at a slow even rate. Being cold out, we only watch for a few min. so I am not sure how long it actually was visible in  our area. This, being a strange event, has my curiosity at what it might be. I am very interested in any opinions you might have on this sighting.;43.0573;-92.952
