I was talking to a friend of mine on the cell phone when I saw what I would call a green colored shooting star.  The star didn't appear to be falling though. I then could see Venus clearly and investigated further with binocculars and saw another light by venus. The light appeared be have flashing blue, red, and whit lights and failed to move quickly. It slowly moved. I called two co-workers and asked them to observe the sighting and to give me an opinion of what they believed it was. They saw it and confirmed my sighting. We looked to see if perhaps it was the shuttle endeavor, but that didn't launch as of yet!  Clueless as to what the green shooting star was, and the lighted object!  From my location, I was looking into the eastern sky and observed the green shooting star go northward from venus for about one second.;41.9138;-95.4844
