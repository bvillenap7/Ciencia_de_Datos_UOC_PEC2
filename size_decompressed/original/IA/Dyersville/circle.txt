I was on a hill top with my truck near New Wine park, at first I thought it was a helicopter the way it stayed in place for so long and moved slowly back and forth.   Then on Sunday Aug 279 4th, same time and again it headed towards new vienna iowa and near me with I saw it again and I tried to shine a large spot light at it, as it was coming my way it was chased away by a military jet...strange, maybe the military has a new toy!;42.4862;-91.1121
