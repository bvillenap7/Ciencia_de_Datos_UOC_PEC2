Hovering lights in western sky, Washington, Iowa;2010-08-10 00:00:00;30-45 mins didnt get to w;Hovering lights in western sky, Washington, Iowa I was driving to work heading northbound and it was pitch black from the thunderstorm and to the east, there was lighting and I noticed a blinking light to the west, high up there and thought it was plane at first but this light stayed in one spot the whole time. Like it was hovering. I watched it the whole way to work which was about a 10 min drive, but my friend who also works at the same place saw the same exact thing on his way to work behind me about 15 minutes after me. It had red lights in a diamond/pyramid shape, but was blinking like an airliner plane.  I don't know if it was military or whatever...i'm sure there were things going on beyond what they let the general people know.;41.3065;-91.7008
