Traingle UFO sighting clear veiw three witnesses and one stubborn person who wouldn't look;2005-06-14 21:00:00;30 seconds;Traingle UFO sighting clear veiw three witnesses and one stubborn person who wouldn't look 	Well, to start off Id like to say I don't care if anyone believes me or not.  What I saw changed my life, and i will take a lie detector to prove it.  It was about 9 to 10 at night and it just got done storming... I worked with my mother and brother in a self ran janitoring company...  We left our house.. about 6 blocks from our house is a gas station to gas up before work..  Taking our normal path ((which i can go more in to the route if needed.)) another person a friend of mine was along to help us at work that nigh. We were driving a geo metro, a small car I was in the left side of the car..  My friend next to me in the back seat..  My mother driving and my younger brother was in the front seat. the distance between our home and the gas station is grid like city blocks, and right next to the towns broadway... this was not a low populated are..we live on third so.. once we hit 6th street i was looking up in the sky and saw the cloudes where glowing..not enough to make me thing it was something in the sky i thought it was a effect from the storm.. as we drove between street 6 and 7th I was watching this cloud when something starts to lower out of it... It was one of them traingle looking ufo's.. what was crazy was how close it was... for a mila second i couldn't believe what i was looking at cuz ... it was so close if i had a crappy hand gun or a really good sling shot i could hit it. it had a spot light like thing on each point of the traingle and the lights moved indepent from the others.. like they were searching from something... i yelled to the car.. LOOOOOOOOOOOKKK.. (( hehe. what else are you supposed to do when something like that happens)) anyhow.. my mother and brother turned quickly and looked right out.. we slowed the car down we had to be only going 10 at the time anyhow putting my head out the window I trying to get a bet look. the spooky part was... this thing was almost a block long.. hovered in the air pointing the direction we just drove from... and made no freaking sound a! t all..I can't explain to you when you see something almost a block long with no sound, just floating in the air.. its hard to even fathom..my brother and mother were looking at it... but the funny part was my buddy was text messaging and still to this day didn't see it ... but he will say that we were freaking out. Now as my head is hanging out the back window for sight the light in the front points right at me.... I never been scared.. like really scared in my life.... but when that light hit me I was waiting for something bad to happen.. but it was more like they saw us.. and kinda released they were being watch.... the traingle dropped down about 2 feet in the air.. and silently took off.. toward broadway.. bout 7 blocks the direction we came... and moved so damned fast i say it covered... 7 blocks in 2 seconds.. and went back up in to the clouds... mind you when they shot off like that... no force or sound was felt. I am a gamer by nature, and a ufo skeptic.. my brother is a lot the same.. and my mother is the type that she is so damned fightful of something like that she never make it up.  Im not the type of man who makes stuff up.. actually if you ask my friends the thought of this stuff wigs me out but i saw it.. and the truth matters.. im sure i could never tell anyone anything and some day if there are ufo's or miltary planes.. or what ever they are out there we will know.. but what i saw was the truth.. take this account do with it as you please.. i just hope it helps ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Traveling from Omaha to Des moines I witnessed a triangle object near interstate;2005-12-18 18:45:00;3:00 Mins;Traveling from Omaha to Des moines I witnessed a triangle object near interstate.  I believe it was 20-30 yards from the interstate at a radio tower altitude.  Low flying and slow moving.  Several helicopters or planes were in the area. My wife and I witnessed the object for at least 3 minutes. Three lights made the triangle shape were very bright and circular. I believe in the middle of the triangle was a smaller triangle with smaller lights. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Triangle Ufo, with 3 lights on edges and  2 in center over council bluffs. Near the community college.;2012-07-19 00:07:00;3 minutes;Triangle Ufo, with 3 lights on edges and  2 in center over council bluffs. Near the community college. Me and my father were doing reposessions in Coucil bluffs, when all of the sudden i saw  weird looking craft 3 lights in a shape of a triangle with 2 smaller lights in the center (maybe a little off center)   We pulled over because i flipped out and immediatly called it a ufo. We looked at the object for a good 2 minutes.  The weird part is that we could see the blackish outline, it was a perfect triangle.  This is where it gets tricky. for some reason i instantly believed it was an airplane for absolutely no reason, the same happened to my father.  We left and instantly snapped out of the disbelief and realized we had seen something we shouldnt have, after this while we were driving away we looked back to see if it was still there but it was gone.  This encounter has been bothering me all day, so i decided to look up pictures and ended up here.  The craft seemed to have tricked us, which really bothers me.  Also, this object was moving very slowly, made no sound, and was very close to the ground. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
