Three white orange lights in the Western sky that formed a triangle then moved into a line before disappearing.;2013-10-13 18:57:00;8 minutes;Three white orange lights in the Western sky that formed a triangle then moved into a line before disappearing. We were headed southbound on I-29 out of Council Bluffs, Iowa, at 6:57 p.m. on Sunday night, October 13, 2013.  When we reached mile marker 36, the passenger in my car exclaimed “what is that?” I had to lean down to see the objects out the passenger window.  When I looked through the window into the Western sky, I saw three bright objects with an orange tint forming a triangle at about a 45-degree angle to the horizon.  The objects were not moving, but hovering in that position as you could see planes to the north with obvious jet trails.  We were able to quickly pull over at a rest area (Southbound Pacific Junction Rest Area on I-29) and found a clear area where we could video the objects.  Within the first two minutes of seeing these objects they moved from a triangle to a straight line – the point of the triangle staying stationary while the other two rotated and moved to form the line.  As they were doing this, they only signs of motion were the changes in position.  We filmed and watched them for a little more than five minutes after we pulled over.  They then moved from a straight line to a more arced line, again the top point never moving position as the other two moved into position.  The objects did get a bit fainter towards the end of the time we were watching them, but hovered steadily.  We then saw a plane approaching from the south.  As we watched this plane approach closer we were shocked as the instant the plane entered the video frame, the objects disappeared.  No flashing or fading, just completely disappearing like a switch was flipped.  We continued to watch the area for approximately five minutes and nothing reappeared. NOTE:  In the video, you will hear us discussing a fourth object that remained after the other three disappeared.  We did determine after the fact that this was a star however we could find no celestial reason for the other three objects.;41.2567415841585;-95.8514861386136

On the way back at 10:34 PM  exactly 63 miles from Council Bluffs, Iowa and Omaha Ne..we saw ahead a Blinking Strobe Light in the distance ahead. We looked at each other and said almost simultaneously.  What Is That? It did not appear to be moving.It Kept Strobing with a Very Bright Light.  As we came near it some miles ahead,  We approached the object, it did not appear to be moving, just Strobing, Brightly on and off.  As we Finally met up with it, which was about m7 minutes. it was next to us, across the Field next to the interstate, with not a car in sight, and Black as can be.  It was just Strobing above the Middle of this, what seemed like a Field about 500 feet above, Quietly.  I looked for a Pole or some sort of Ground Support, and there was None! as we passed it I did not Notice any Red warning Lights for Aircraft.  We Kept Vocal about how strange this was. Then as we passed it above ! what seemed like an empty field,it Just Disappeared!I Finally had a witness as I have seen the same entity before, but don't tell everybody. It seems best to keep it to yourself. I would have not said anything, except that my son was with me, a NO Nonsense kind of guy,;41.2567415841585;-95.8514861386136
Multiple tiny lights in the sky traveling in a straight line evenly spaced.  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-01-15 18:43:00;5-9 minutes;Multiple tiny lights in the sky traveling in a straight line evenly spaced. Walking to my shop from my house I heard geese flying overhead and looked up but could not see them. But I noticed 3 or so tiny lights that looked like stars moving in a straight line and evenly spaced . I then looked further behind them and saw another 7 to 10 more also moving in a perfectly straight line and evenly spaced. I ran back to the house and called my wife outside to show her and she saw them as well. After 2 minutes or so they moved to a point that they faded out one by one once reaching the same point in the sky. No sound at all as I think they we're too high.;41.2567415841585;-95.8514861386136
