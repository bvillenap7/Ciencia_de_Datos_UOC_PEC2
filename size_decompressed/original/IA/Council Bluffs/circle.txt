I had just set up my Meade Polaris 4.5 reflecting telescope to look at Venus and after I aquired the planet and found focus I noticed a small spherical craft moving through the bottom of my field of view so I tracked the object which was pitch black for almost a full minute and it was moving so quickly I had to use my hands to move the scope as the tracking controls were to slow to follow.I had a 36times eyepiece in the scope and it required no change in focus in the eyepiece its size was double the size of a BB.I was totally circular and I do wish I would have been able to use a higher power eyepiece to see if there was any surface detail but at the speed it was moving Iit would have been impossible to keep it in such a narrow field of view.I was moving from the Northeast to the Southwest.I am also a Ham radio operator and a storm spotter callsign N0VMY and I have seen many strange things dealing with weather and aircraft but this was a textbook UFO.;41.2567415841585;-95.8514861386136
Standing alone object in night sky changes color after I shine flashlight on it.;2019-09-02 21:45:00;20 minutes;Standing alone object in night sky changes color after I shine flashlight on it. On September 2nd, the day and night after Labor Day  I witnessed a white circular object in the night which my step dad said had been seen before by his naked eye.   I proceeded with my mom to go outside and shine a flashlight on the object.  The object went from white circular to orange yellowish to green.   At that time I got scared and went inside because the boogeyman really did exist.  Ha ha ha.  That's that.;41.2567415841585;-95.8514861386136
