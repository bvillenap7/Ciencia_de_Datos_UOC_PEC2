Small orange light morphing into large triangle(4-5 stories thick) with bright lights on underside;2003-05-15 21:00:00;5 minutes;small orange light morphing into large triangle(4-5 stories thick) with bright lights on underside While driving on a side road, I had my girlfriend stop because of a small orange light that was moving in the sky, I had seen this the night before so was curious.   I got out of the car and the tiny orange light changed/morphed into a bright white red light. This in turn made visible a very very large triangle that was thick (maybe 4-5 stories)  The object passed directley over us with no sound and was flying extremely low.   I jumped into the car in almost horror and we took off down the gravel road we were on with the object seeming to follow us.  We turned into a farm driveway and the object seem to disappear over the farm house.   We were regaining our composure when the object reappeared out of nowhere and hovered over us. My girlfriend tryed to drive away and the car just spun its tires.  We were freaked out when the object vanished.   We had a very good view of this thing and was like nothing we had ever seen.;41.2567415841585;-95.8514861386136
