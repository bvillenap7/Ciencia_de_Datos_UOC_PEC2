the object darted around until it went over the horizon;2007-01-10 23:00:00;57 minutes;the object darted around until it went over the horizon i was on my way home from the nearby industrial estate, when i noticed a extremely bright light in the sky, my dog Timmy, went inside the house when we got home obviously unerved by the goings on. the craft under the gaze of my binoculars, proceeded to grow in the sky, to the the point it resembled a large aircraft.   The terrain nearby was a flat grasssland and slightly marshy.  the craft started to dart around the sky in random directions until it finally disappeared over the horizon.  I stayed out for a further hour, looking for it but it did not reappear. the next morning we (me and my dog) and we noticed strange burn like marks and a sulphorous smell was detected.

I was driving near the industrial estate when a bright light appeared on the horizon. It began to climb into the sky and grow larger. T;2007-01-10 23:05:00;2 hours;I was driving near the industrial estate when a bright light appeared on the horizon. It began to climb into the sky and grow larger. There was marshland nearby.  I stopped my car and tried to take video footage on my cellphone, a Sony Eriksson k800i, but the light just covered the screen and there was nothing visible. I  began darting around until it flew over the skyline.;41.2567415841585;-95.8514861386136
Strange, Swift, 'Geese'.;2007-10-20 00:24:00;2;Strange, Swift, 'Geese'. Went out to smoke a cigarette and within minutes of going outside I noticed a shape that flew from the north directly over me on a south bearing. I live near an airport and am use to seeing planes fly over head, but this object had no lights and made no sound. My initial sense was a circular object with a lighter colored leading edge in a chevron shape. It moved swiftly covering about half the sky in a second. Within minutes I saw a similar object about half a mile east of me. I went inside and woke my girlfriend and told her what I had seen. I tried to assimilate what it could have possibly been. Ranging from a glider to stealth planes. I noticed my neighbors outside and told them what I had seen. Within minutes we saw it again. 3 groups, the first looking like what I had seen, then two more groups. Oddly, the last two groups appeared to be birds. One group had 2 'birds', strangly and eerily glowing in the night. I could barely discern 'flapping'. The other group had maybe 3 'birds' in it. But they moved so swiftly. I tried to compare mentally the differences in what I had seen before and after I had witnesses, and it seems they looked more like birds after I talked to the others. The disparity in viewings comes from the apparent speed of the objects as they flew overhead. I cannot seem to shake the feeling that these are not birds. Oddly enough, as many times as I have went outside to smoke cigarettes at night. I have never noticed these 'birds' in any season. Let alone the three shooting stars I have also witnessed in the sky this night. I have never seen so many shooting stars in one night, let alone my whole life...and 3 ofthem within an hour along with these sightings.

No sound, no trail, fast to appear slow to leave.;2012-08-15 00:00:00;2 minutes;No sound no trail fast to appear slow to leave. Was watching a single light crest over the bluffs and I got my camera out just in time to photograph a chevron shape moving behind the single light.
