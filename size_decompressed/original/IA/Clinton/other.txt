Single white unidentified object detected in residential area.;2021-07-05 22:00:00;2 minutes;Single white unidentified object detected in residential area. It looked like a star but moved at an alarming rate vertically above us in our view in a zig zag pattern. When it reached over our heads, it disappeared into the sky as though it shot straight up. It was too high to be a helicopter or drone. Too fast to be a plane. There were no blinking lights or any sound that we could detect. After it disappeared, a plane came by a little lower than where we percieved the object going horizontally right to left through our view, then we noticed what we believe to be a helicopter on the far left. As for us observers, we are not ufo hunters. We are passive enthusiasts. This was my first ufo sighting (ufo as in we could not attribute it to a known aircraft).;41.8528000000001;-90.2071
