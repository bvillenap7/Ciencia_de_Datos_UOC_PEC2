Large faint dimly lit chevron shaped lights travelling quickly high in the sky.  ((anonymous report));2017-11-01 18:45:00;10 seconds;large faint dimly lit chevron shaped lights travelling quickly high in the sky On the evening of 11-20-17 at approximately 18:45 my wife and I were walking our dog in a large, dark, field on the edge of Clinton, Iowa.   I was admiring the clear sky when I notice a very large cluster of faint lights travelling quickly from south to north.  I immediately asked my wife if she saw it and she replied yes.  She suggested that I shine a very powerful flashlight at it, and I did so to no avail.  It disappeared very quickly.  The lights were very small and faint, suggesting to us that they were very high up in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
