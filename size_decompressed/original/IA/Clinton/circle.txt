The lights came close to right above our van and I rolled down the windows thinking I would hear the helicopter but there was no sound.  We pulling into the movie store parking lot and they were directly above us, again no sound, very orange round lights, one each, they seemed super super close above us, I thought the two lights were attached but one light stayed directly above us and the other moved north which was freaky, then would stop like it was waiting, then continued to move north again.  Two men in a car came bouncing into the parking lot at a high rate of speed, jumped out and said are you seeing what we are seeing I said yes, I can’t believe it, no idea what it is.  They thought it was very strange that there was no sound what-so-ever too.  Shortly after the two men arrived ! the second orange light moved north/west and finally disappeared from our site. I’m still kind of in disarray, still in shock wondering what these lights really were.;41.8528000000001;-90.2071
Non flashing orange lights going westward across Clinton Iowa making no sound;2012-10-02 21:15:00;10 minutes;non flashing orange lights going westward across Clinton Iowa making no sound About 15 orange lights in a row went westward across Clinton Iowa.   They seemed low because they were large in size.  They did not flash.  But as they got to the west side of Clinton, they slowly faded until they no longer could be seen.;41.8528000000001;-90.2071

The sky was riddle with shinny stars, as I was walking, I had  been looking at the ground.  In the  back of my mind  I heard my self.  When I did all the stars we're gone.  It was pitch black. 2sec.  A  big circle of light yellow appeared straight up above me.  Half a second it turned reddish orange.  It wasn't moving while it turned colors.  It took off the speed of it burnt its way through the air.  Opening door in the sky.  It was gone some kind of dust was left.;41.8528000000001;-90.2071

The star like light then slowly moved north at a very slow steady pace for about 30-45 seconds, until it disappeared as randomly as it appeared.  There were no flashing lights, it moved a bit faster than airplanes and seemed to be higher up in the sky than planes go.;41.8528000000001;-90.2071
