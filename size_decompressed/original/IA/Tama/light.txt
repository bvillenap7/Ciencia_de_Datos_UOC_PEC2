BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT MOVING ACROSS SKY SEEN ON THREE OCASSIONS;2008-05-20 21:30:00;FEW MINUTES;BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT MOVING ACROSS SKY SEEN ON THREE OCASSIONS ON THREE DIFFERENT OCCASIONS MY HUSBAND, A FRIEND OF MY FAMILY AND MYSELF HAVE SEEN WHAT OTHERS MAY HAVE REPORTED ON JUNE 7TH.  WE LIVE IN A RURAL AREA AND HAVE A GOOD VIEW OF THE EASTERN SKY FROM OUR BACK PORCH AND ALWAYS HAVE AN EYE UP TO THE SKY. THE NIGHT WE FIRST SAW THE LIGHT IT WAS AROUND MAY 20TH, WE THOUGHT IT WAS AN AIRPLANE.  IT WAS A BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT NOT PULSING OR BLINKING, JUST A BRIGHT LIGHT. IT MOVED RATHER SWIFTLY BUT NOT AS TO THINK IT WAS OTHER THAN A PLANE.  IT FLEW DIRECTLY OVER OUR HOME FROM THE SOUTHWEST HEADED IN AN NORTHEASTERN DIRECTION.  LIKE I SAID AT THE TIME WE THOUGHT IT TO BE A SMALL AIRCRAFT BUT WHEN IT FLEW OVER OUR HOME WE HEARD NO SOUND.  AT THE TIME THERE WERE NO CLOUDS IN THE SKY SO I DIDN'T THINK THERE SHOULD BE ANY BUFFER TO THE NOISE THAT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MAKING. THE SECOND TIME WAS ON THE FOLLOWING SATURDAY MAY THE 24TH.  THIS TIME THE LIGHT, SAME COLOR AND AROUND THE SAME DISTANCE IN THE SKY  CAME FROM THE EAST. MY SON AND I WERE DRIVING HOME FROM THE GROCERY STORE AND WE SEEN IT FROM OUR VEHICLE.  WE WERE ONLY A 1/4 OF A MILE IF THAT FROM OUR HOME SO WE CALLED MY HUSBAND AND TOLD HIM TO GO OUT AND LOOK TO SEE IF HE COULD CATCH A GLIMPSE OF IT ALSO. AT THIS TIME WE HAD THE SAME PEOPLE WHO WITNESSED IT INITIALLY PLUS MY SON WHO IS 8. BY THE TIME WE GOT CLOSER TO OUR HOME THE LIGHT CHANGED DIRECTION AND STARTED TOWARD THE NORTH. ( I ALSO NEED TO INTERJECT THAT ON THIS NIGHT WE HAD THUNDERHEADS OVER US AND IT WAS REALLY LIGHTING. BUT THE LIGHT WAS BELOW THE CLOUDS AND ABOUT THE SAME DISTANCE FROM THE GROUND AS THE NIGHT BEFORE.) MY SON AND I LOST SIGHT OF THE LIGHT AS WE GOT CLOSER TO OUR HOME BUT MY HUSBAND AND FRIEND OF THE FAMILY SAID THEY COULD SEE IT FROM OUT BACK PORCH ONCE AGAIN, RIGHT OVER HEAD.  AT THIS TIME I CALLED MY HUSBAND BACK AND WHILE HE WAS ANSWERING HIS PHONE OUR FRIEND USED THE BINOCULARS TO GET A CLOSER LOOK.  HE SAID WHEN HE GOT THEM TO FOCUS ON THE LIGHT AND LOOKED THE LIGHT FLASHED GREEN AND SHOT OFF TO THE NORTH AT A FASTER SPEED, AND DISAPPEARED. ON OUR THIRD AND FINAL SIGHTING THE LIGHT CAME FROM THE WEST AND WAS HEADED IN AN EASTWARD DIRECTION, AGAIN MOVING ABOUT THE SAME SPEED AND THE SAME DISTANCE UP.   IT NEVER CHANGED COLOR, MOVED ANY FASTER OR HAD ANY SOUND BUT WAS SEEN BY TWO OTHER PEOPLE BESIDES THE ORIGINAL THREE OF US.  AND WE HAVE NEVER SEEN IT SINCE.
