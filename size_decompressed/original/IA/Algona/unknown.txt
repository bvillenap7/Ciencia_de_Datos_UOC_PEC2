My fiance and I were out looking at stars about 6 miles north of town when we noticed what at first seemed to be an airplane in the northeastern sky and about 2 o'clock (horizontally).  When then watched it go up and down and kind of in a loop as lights on it flashed red, white and green.  We watched this for about 10 minutes when my finace looked to the west to let his eyes adjust and saw that there was one in approximately in the same position but in the western sky.  We each watched an object for about 10 more minutes then I called his brother who was with a friend so they could come see it.  In the meantime, the objects continued their patterns of zig zagging and going up and down.  Soon, too other friends showed up from doing farm work and saw them.  At this point we had been watching for about a half an hour.  Then my fiance's brother and friend showed up and saw what was happening as well.  We all watched for close to another 20 minutes, at which point the western object seemed to be getting farther away to the west and the eastern object was lessening it's movements.  We are all farm people.  None of us were drunk or doing drugs of any kind.  As of 20:06 they were still visible in the sky.;43.0678;-94.2281
