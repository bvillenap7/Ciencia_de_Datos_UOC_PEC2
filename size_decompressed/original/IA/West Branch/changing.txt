Strange Shape-Changing Object over rural Iowa;2000-10-20 21:00:00;10 Minutes;Strange Shape-Changing Object over rural Iowa My friends and I were driving home to Iowa City from a West Branch martial arts class with one of their mothers. We were driving along the highway when, to the SSE of us, I saw in the sky what I thought was just a particularly bright star. After a few minutes, it seemed to divide into two smaller stars, which began to circle each other. I rolled down my window because I thought it might be a reflection playing tricks on me. When I still saw the two 'stars', I called the attention of my friends to it. We observed it for a minute or so, then decided to pull over and get out to have a better look. After we stood for a few minutes, each of the two 'stars' seemed to turn into a large white isosceles-type triagle, joined at two points kind of like a butterfly, like this : |><| (The triangles were actually much longer top-to-bottom than that, but you get the idea) Eventually, the two triangles returned to the two stars, which eventually merged back into the one, whiched seemed to glow with a faint amber tint for the rest of the drive. We were at a loss for natural explanation, but we're no geniuses and I suppose there could be one. I don't know how it could be a terrestrial craft, and even if aliens and such really exist, it still seems an almost impossible design for a craft even with incredible technology, so who knows? Any ideas you might have would be appreciated.;41.6726;-91.3141
