3 red lights 1 bright white one and 1 dim white one.;2014-07-04 22:00:00;6 minutes;3 red lights 1 bright white one and 1 dim white one. It was 10:00pm and I was called outside and when I went outside I saw 3 orange/red cylinders floating through the sky in a triangle formation.   I thought it was Chinese lanterns but it was not windy at all, also it couldn't have stayed in that formation that long. I walked down a pathway and saw one bright white light floating through the sky very fast.  It couldn't have been in the sky more than 30 seconds. about a minute later at home I saw one very dim light floating slower than the white light but aster than the 3 red lights. it floated through the sky before disappearing into the sky. What were these?;41.6726;-91.3141
