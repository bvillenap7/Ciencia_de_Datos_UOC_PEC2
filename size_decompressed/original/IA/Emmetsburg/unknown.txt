I notice it had one blinking white(?) light and two to three gold or yellow, more gold than yellow. Like a mercury vapor street light. I proceeded to get binoculars. And when i returned the object was perhaps 4 or 5 miles away and south of my position. And i continued to watch the object through the binoculars. Was difficult to keep the binoculars steady. Bu i saw the same thing through them. One blinking white light, and two to three gold lights! Estimated speed was maybe 50 to 70 mph. Didnt hear any noise from the craft. Will try to keep an eye out for the object again in the future. The gold colored lights were the most unusual part of the sighting! I have never seen lights like this on any flying object before!!!;43.1035;-94.6917
