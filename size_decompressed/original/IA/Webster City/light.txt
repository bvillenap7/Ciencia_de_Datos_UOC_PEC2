Fast moving light over nightime Webster city.;2009-03-18 20:13:00;10 secs;Fast moving light over nightime Webster city. I was playing basket ball I felt like looking in the sky( it was a beautiful night to) and then i saw a fast moving light that didn't leave a streak (so I know it wasn't a shooting star because they leave dust and junk) and after a bit it went away im pretty sure that wasn't a plane, astroid, or meteorite. It was by either the little dipper or the big dipper ( i have have a hard time telling the apart. But moving at a really great speed at least half the speed of light or so. It was probably at least by the atmosphere but still in space). ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));42.4577;-93.8277
Non-moving, non blinking, yellow cluster of lights hovering 20 degrees above horizon, Hamilton Co., Iowa, 4/13/13, for couple of min.;2013-04-13 05:25:00;1-2 minutes;Non moving, non blinking, yellow cluster of lights hovering 20 degrees above horizon, Hamilton Co., Iowa, 4/13/13, for couple of min. While driving on Hwy 20 just west of Hwy 69 in Iowa at approximately 5:25 a.m., Saturday, April, 13, 2013, saw a round yellow light, a second light a little smaller yellow directly above and a little to the left, and a couple of muted same color smaller lights to the right of larger light.  Was driving east and the lights were approximately 20 degrees above the horizon and between 1 and 2 o'clock south of due east.   We saw them for a minute or two and then they disappeared instantly.  They did not flash but were steady, stayed in the same place, and then all went out at the same time.  They looked like they might be further than Interstate 35.  This was before sunrise and no visible day light. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.4577;-93.8277
