Was looking to the west and turned to go into my house and looked up to the south and seen a cigar-shaped silver to a whitish craft traveling north at approximately 15,000 ft and moving at a rate less than a jet airliner.  I reached into my vehicle to get my binoculars trying to keep my eyes fixed on the craft.  I looked down to grab them and it was gone out of sight.  I searched the sky and could not see it any longer.  I ran into the house to tell my son and father.  I ran up to my sons room to share the info.  We looked out his upstairs window facing east and spotted it again going from north to south.  It was visible for about 10 seconds and went into a cloud and not seen again.  We went outside and searched the sky and at approximately 8:45 PM we seen 2 jet aircraft traveling from west to east/ southeast at a very high speed to where the last place we seen the unidentified craft. I am a 48 yr old college graduate with a degree in horticulture science.  I am a occasional sky watcher, space station and other interesting things in our sky.  This is my first time ever seeing a UFO.  My son is a 15yr old high school freshman and is a star watcher and likes to learn about our planetary system.;42.0763;-92.3865
