5 liights in southern sky;2006-11-19 20:02:00;1 min;5 liights in southern sky Around 8:02 pm walk outside the house and saw 5 strange lights in southern sky. They looked to be Id guess 10 miles away. Just a guess.Instincts told me instantly that this was strange.Ran as to the house to get daughter to witness but the objects were gone already.Couldnt have been more than 15 or 20 secs.Called the radio station and a lady had just called in wth the same report.Started asking persons I met daily if they saw any lights in the sky around that date.Have to date found 2 other persons that saw them.One said he didnt want to tell anyone about them because of the possible stigma.He was obviously shaken by the event.Only possible explaination was flares from a military aircraft but that would seem a little out of place for them though in this area.Difinetly not meteor.Objects were either still or moving very very slowly.;43.176;-95.4826
