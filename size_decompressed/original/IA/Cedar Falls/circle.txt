I want to believe.....;2007-11-04 10:00:00;5 seconds;I want to believe..... I was on my way to work and stopped at the stop sign and was waiting for the traffic to go through. I looked across road to look at the smoke stack in the area, it is only a block away so it is really close to me, I noticed to the left of it a bright, circular ball.  It looked similar to what the reflection of a satellite or when the sun is low enough to make a plane look like a ball of brite lite.   There is a airport near. I would usually think it was a plane, but it was later in the day when the sun is overhead and it stayed in one spot. I wasn't there very long so when I got to work to look at the area of sighting, nothing was there. No plane in the sky.
