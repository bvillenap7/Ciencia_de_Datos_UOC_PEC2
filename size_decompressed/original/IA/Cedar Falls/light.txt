Strange light bobs up and down three times before circling around the east side of the city and disappearing.;2007-01-01 00:11:00;3-5 minutes;Strange light bobs up and down three times before circling around the east side of the city and disappearing. I have never seen a UFO before in my life, so this was at least significant for me.  I was the only witness to this event that I know of (no one I know made any mention of it, anyway), though anyone could have seen it, provided they had the right view.  At about 12:11 AM on New Year's Day, 1-January-2007, I witnessed a single, strangely bright, white light in the sky north of Cedar Falls, Iowa.  At first, I thought it was either an airplane or an unusually bright star.  I realized it wasn't an airplane when I noticed that not only were there none of the telltale noises of an airplane, but there were none of the characteristic blinking lights either.  My suspicions of it being a star were disproved when it slowly began growing in size and moving slightly upward, as if whatever it was moved closer to my location.  It stopped where it was after about 20 seconds, and at this point it was about the size of a pencil eraser when held at arm's length.  It hovered in the same position for about 40 seconds.  It then moved slowly to the east for about 5 seconds, before moving first up, then down, all slowly.  It returned to its original height, then moved back west to its original position.  It stopped again, then moved west and began the same process once more: up, down, middle.  It returned to its first stopping position once again, and repeated the same ordeal, moving up, then down, then middle.  It then began moving slowly to the east once more, and when it stopped in the same position it had before, I thought it was about to repeat the whole thing over again.  But after sitting still for about 15 seconds, it began moving fairly quickly to the southwest, which, from where I was standing, almost seemed like it was just circling around the east side of the city and heading south.  It became obstructed by houses and trees at that point, and although I continued to watch for it, I never saw it again.;42.5231467741936;-92.4482790322582
Four crafts, flashing red, green and brilliant white lights, hovering overhead, one making zigzag movements.;2007-07-21 12:30:00;1.5 hours;Four crafts, flashing red, green and brilliant white lights, hovering overhead, one making zigzag movements. 12:30 a.m. Brilliant white lit hovering craft in the south sky, with alternating green/blue (atop white light) and (under white light) red. Craft does sudden zigzag, stops, and hovers. At a  distance from the white, green and red lit craft, “something” smaller with only flashing red lights, hovers beneath and the the side of it.  I’ve noticed this for 1 -2 weeks at approximately the same time of night. Tonight, and in addition, there were two smaller crafts with less brilliant lights. One, straight west, and one above my head where I was standing, to the north. Both hovered. One of these had been to the east before it suddenly made a fast move closer in my direction to the north.  12:52 a.m. Crafts to the west and north have disappeared. They were not planes! The larger white, green and red lit craft has moved to the west, southwest. It hovers. The smaller red lit craft has moved with it, maintaining the same distance from the larger craft as it had when they were in the south sky.  1:05 a.m.  I returned to look at the crafts. They continue to hover, The smaller craft continues to flash red lights.  1:40 a.m Red flashing light craft has disappeared. Solid hover bright white lit craft remains minus the green and red lights.;42.5231467741936;-92.4482790322582

It was fairly low and was going NNW. It was in view for only about 2 - 3 seconds. There wasn't a tail, so I don't think it was a meteor, plus it looked like it was parallel to the ground. If you want more info, send an email and I can call. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD));42.5231467741936;-92.4482790322582
Diagonal line of bending light seen above university from the moon on Hallow's Eve.;2010-10-30 02:00:00;about 5 minutes;Diagonal line of bending light seen above university from the moon on Hallow's Eve. After joining the Halloween Dance from my previous university, I was walking through the parking lot of the university with my friend, waiting for my father to come pick me up. It was a bit chilly but no wind. No cars were out that late at night and no one was around but myself and my friend. When we got to the middle of the parking lot, I looked up at the moon, the sky was completely clear of clouds. The moon was full. But I stood there and noticed a completely dark black diagonal line going through the middle of the moon. The line was like this: / . It didn’t change shape, shrink in size, or change in direction. The line was moving at a very slow pace through the moon. I also noticed that this line, from the earth to the moon and from the outer rim of the moon out through the night sky, the dark line was connected to a sun-beam-like light. As the dark line moved to the right, finally completely off the moon, the dark line vanished and formed completely with the ‘light’ line. In my opinion, this object seemed to bend light. By watching this line for 5 minutes or so, I realized that this line was very long.  Possibly as if it went from the side of Earth, through the moon and continuing through the night sky to reach the other end of the Earth. I was not the only one to see this.  My friend watched with me and my mother, who was on my cell phone on loud speaker, heard me explain what we were seeing. I don’t know about how my friend felt as we watched, but even though I was slightly cold from the weather, I felt very peaceful.  As if there were no threat.;42.5231467741936;-92.4482790322582
Bright golden light seen twice on the same road to home.;2011-12-29 20:00:00;10-15 minutes;Bright golden light seen twice on the same road to home. Coming home from school at 8pm (20:00), from Cedar Falls to Stout, my father and I saw a bright golden light out in the country side road on the way home. The light was, by my guess, 4 or 5 miles away. The light was too high above the trees and houses to be a light on a pole or a decoration. Since we were in the car, it’s hard to tell whether or not the light moved as well.  There were no other lights with or on the light to define it as an airplane. The road we took was long, 5 miles or so.  From turning onto that road to the end of the road, the light went from bright to dim to finally gone. Also, the night sky was full of clouds, there were no star light nor moon to be seen. One more thing: My father and I have seen this light twice. On 12/28/2011 at 5pm (17:00) and 12/29/2011 at 8pm (20:00). Both on the same road in the exact same area. The second time we saw this, I tried taking a picture with my cell, but the footage made it show two very dim lights. I’m not sure if there were two lights. From the naked eye, I only saw one.;42.5231467741936;-92.4482790322582
