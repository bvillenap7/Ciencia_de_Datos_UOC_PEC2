White dimming object north of Cedar Falls Mall.;2016-07-14 23:15:00;4 minutes;White dimming object north of Cedar Falls Mall and What appeared to be the brightness star on the northern side of my location started to shift south at a steady speed.  It was a solid white color, no more distinctions could be made.  The further it moved, the less light it gave off.   Within 250 yards of its starting point, it couldn't be seen. 23 minutes later,  it was seen again going north, 75 yards West of where it was seen last.  It shone yellow very brightly as a flash, then disappeared.  Conventional and iridium satellites have been ruled out.;42.5231467741936;-92.4482790322582
