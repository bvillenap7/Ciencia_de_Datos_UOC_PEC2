Red/Orange sphere seen descending over Cedar Falls/North Cedar.;2016-01-13 22:15:00;10 minutes;Red/Orange sphere seen descending over Cedar Falls/ North Cedar. While smoking a cigarette on my porch, I saw a star that was brighter than any other stars on the northern side however it wasn't white like the other stars, it was reddish/orange, and spherical. It moved downward vertically (using a a tree as a reference).   It gained more altitude in a smooth and steady motion, then descended again directly downward.   I went inside to get another cigarette trying to look at it more, which took less than 5 min.  When I went back to the porch, it was gone.;42.5231467741936;-92.4482790322582
