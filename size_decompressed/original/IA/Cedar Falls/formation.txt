The lights of a couple actually shifted from white to red while the the other 2 stayed white.  The two colored objects just moved a little bit to the right and disappeared.  The two white objects remained and then seconds later disappeared as well.;42.5231467741936;-92.4482790322582
Question Mark Formation in the East.;2015-07-29 02:30:00;Hour;Question Mark Formation in the East We noticed a blinking light very low in the sky to the west of us.  It would dip above and below the tree line and occasionally blink red, as well as disappear and reappear on multiple occasions.  The light did not move with the skyline.   We continued to watch this light until at approximately 2:30am a group of lights in the formation of what looked like a question mark appeared in the east.   It was very bright at first, blinking orange, green, and multiple variations of blue.  There were five definitive lights, and a few other less bright lights that would fade in and out.  The question mark would frequently look as if someone were drawing a line through the question mark.   A few of the lights would move so quickly they would look like they were making a shape.  For instance the top left light  kept making an oval shape.  The lights were not a definite shape.  They appeared to us as circles at first, and the next minute would look like small triangles.   We continued to watch this formation for about an hour, over the course of this hour the formation dimmed, and rose in the sky.  The formation did not follow the skyline either.    We watched it pass a star next to it as it was rising. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.5231467741936;-92.4482790322582
