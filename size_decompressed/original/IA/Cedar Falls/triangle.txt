Low-flying, brisk moving, silent, boomerang/triangular shaped set of lights in a number of approximately 10-20 total lights.;2014-03-30 10:30:00;15-30 seconds;Low-flying, brisk moving, silent, boomerang/triangular shaped set of lights in a number of approximately 10-20 total lights. 	At about 10:30 p.m. on the night of March 30, 2014, me and one other individual were outside letting the dog go potty.  In mid-conversation, the person whom I was with pointed up exclaiming at me to look, whereupon I found myself looking at what I first thought were TWO low-flying objects, both boomerang or triangular shaped, moving in perfect proportion with each other.   The first set of lights being about a dozen in quantity and the second set of lights being only three, flying at a brisk and constant pace through the night sky.   The other I was with described it as a very “smooth moving” object, to which I agree.  In addition, there was no sound of any kind to go with the moving lights, they moved in utter silence. The lights flew off and out of sight within a maximum of 15 seconds. After the object left sight, me and the other I was with were in sheer bewilderment and attempted to justify what we saw.  As if on cue, a human-operated commercial airplane was flying elsewhere in the sky.  The point I would like to make is that this plane looked entirely different than what we saw, and it appeared to be at a much higher altitude as well. 	We both went back inside discussing and drawing what we saw before Google’ing what we just saw.  We then saw multiple reports from other people describing exactly what we saw as far as the shape, speed, and sound of the object.  This is where I decided based on mutual images of the UFO’s that it was most likely ONE flying object with three under lights.  This would explain how the sets of lights were moving in such closeness and perfection with each other.   We also discovered that the night March 30th, has been a significant date in the history of UFO sightings with waves of UFO sightings having occurred in Belgium, U.K., the U.S. and more. 	I would also like to add that me and the individual I was with are credible sources, we wrote this report on the exact night (within a half hour) of the sighting, and we had no alcohol or any other substances that could have altered what we saw whatsoever, and we totally agreed with one another about exactly what we had just seen.

Possible UFO Sighting in Iowa, October 9, 2014.;2014-10-09 21:00:00;>15 minutes;Possible UFO Sighting in Iowa October 9, 2014. I heard on the news tonight, that the International Space Station could be seen at 7:30 for 6 minutes.  I began to look at the sky during this time but did not see anything.  It was a bit cloudy and I thought perhaps I would indeed have to wait for another time.  I have never witnessed seeing it, and I continued to look at the sky in hopes I did not miss it, etc.   Around 9:00 p.m. my friend and I were walking to her car from our homes.  I again looked up, and there in the sky we both saw a triangle shaped flying object with flashing red lights that alternated with turquoise blue when it slowed down or changed speed.  At one point it for a moment hovered a bit.   We realized then, it was perhaps a UFO.  The pattern it flew was like it was “mapping” the sky.  I mean, it did not fly straight and then away.  It would come back from the North and then South again.   My friend ran into her home. I continued to watch it from my window.  Perhaps 30 minutes or so later, after it disappeared, a large airplane or craft of our own flew close to where we had seen the other object.;42.5231467741936;-92.4482790322582
V shaped dark object traveling East SE at approx 250 MPH.;2015-11-19 21:02:00;7-8;V shaped dark object traveling East SE at approx 250 MPH. . Approx 9:00 PM or 21 hundred hours.  Clear evening, no clouds, temps in the mid 30's.  Went out to have a smoke and noticed a movement to my right peripheral side vision in the star filled sky.  Saw what appeared as a fuzzy outline of a V-formation, or triangle craft.  Hard to discern it as it appeared slightly lighter then the dark background sky, fuzzy edges with a translucent appearance.   Very difficult to see unless looking right at it.  No lights, no sound and its glide path was to the East SouthEast.  Watched it for 7-8 seconds before it faded from view.   Speed looked like around 250 MPH at say 3000 feet altitude, just a guess thou as I could not tell its size.  When first overhead it would have been the size of my hand at arm's length.   Object did not reflect from the moon that evening and for a lack of better words, appeared to cloak itself somehow to the background.  Very strange.   I had my cell phone out however there was not enough time to capture it as ! I was wondering what it was in the first place.  I am knowledgeable in earth sciences, all known aircraft and consider myself an amateur astronomer.  It matched the dark sky so much, I doubt a photo would have shown it unless during the day.   Intend to build an Infrared video array now, I want some substantial answers..................;42.5231467741936;-92.4482790322582
