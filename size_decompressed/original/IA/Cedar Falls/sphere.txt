They were moving north west against the wind, they first appeared as balloons with lights on them, but then they speed up and slowed down, moved in irregular patterns, tried taking a picture but it did not show up well on my camera phone, they were a yellow reddish color, bright and spaced evenly apart for a about 15sec. then shifted away from each other and moved west. The one object to the north of the other lost its illumination, while the other moved away quickly until it was no longer visible unexplainable. They were silent. Slow at first but changed speeds and directions. I am typically logical and rational, but I cannot explain what myself and 3 other individuals saw this evening.
