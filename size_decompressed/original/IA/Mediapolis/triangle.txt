I have always enjoyed the night sky and as I looked up I realized there was cloud cover.  The clouds were heavy with moisture similar to dense fog.  I began to scan the sky to see if there was a break in clouds when, from the south, an object came into view. It appeared to be low flying and it was silent. I live in a very small town and the nights are always quiet.  The object had a basic triangular shape and at what I assume to be the front of the object was a white triangle, behind this triangle and out an equal distance to the left and right were white rectangles and behind them were two more  white rectangles.  To give you an idea of the brightness of these shapes I would compare them to typical white paper for printing against a backdrop of dirty white.  They were not bright but definitely noticeable.  The object flew over my house in a northwest direction. I ran to the backyard hoping to see it flying away but I didnâ€™t. This is the second time in three weeks that I have seen something unidentifiable come from the south and fly toward the northwest.  The first time it was a beautiful clear night with a temperature of about 40f.  The object was the same shape as previously described but instead of a solid white color there were bright white lights at each corner of the triangle and rectangles. It was as if the object was trying to blend in with its surroundings.  Another difference between the two was the speed. This time the object came from the south extremely quick, slowed down, changed direction and flew away even quicker than it appeared. It was in sight no more than four seconds.;41.0019;-91.1329
