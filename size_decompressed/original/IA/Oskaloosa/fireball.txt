What appeared to be a star, slowly started decending toward the Southeast horizon.It slowly changed from a small bright light, to a bigger redish orange. It would fall real slow and then pause for a few seconds, then continue to fall looking like a magnetic fiery ball, with distorted wavy trails beneath it , instead of behind it. We watched, until it finally disapeared into the horizon, which was a tall row of trees. We also noticed four more lights, 2 were stationary one to our left and to our right. They were moving up and down, and side to side, when looking into binuculars, i could see bright blue lights going clockwise, and bright red lights going counter clockwise. The lights were moving so fast,causing it to pulse. The other lights we seen, were small solid white lights that were very fast. One came from the west and went straight north. The other came from the east heading west. This all unfolded in about 90 mins, ive never seen anything like it!!!!;41.2946;-92.6442
