A dark, vertical boomerang that moved slowly;2000-03-01 23:00:00;3 minutes;A dark, vertical boomerang that moved slowly I was walking my dog in town at about 11 PM. The sky was clear and stars were visible. Looking NW, an area of the sky was blacked out, at an angle between 20 and 40 degrees from the horizontal. Looking closer, the blacked out area was the shape of a boomerang, oriented vertically, wider in the middle than at the ends, somewhat larger in the sky than a full moon. The concave side of the shape was in the direction of motion. I stood still, and the shape moved slowly westward, blocking out stars behind it. As I focused, I could see that the object had a surface comparable to dark, polished aluminum, as the stars' images slightly wrapped around the edges of the object as it moved. I saw no lights on the object itself and heard no sound. Its distance from me must have been at least two miles, but probably not more than five. As it continued to move westward it passed behind some trees. I tried to get an unobstructed view again, but by then I could not see it any more.;41.2946;-92.6442
