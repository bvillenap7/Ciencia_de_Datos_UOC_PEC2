Stationary object with red, white and blue flashing lights.;2002-09-08 23:30:00;continuous;Stationary object with red, white and blue flashing lights. We too are seeing this object in the northeastern sky that is emmitting red,white and blue lights.  The object has been noticable for a week or so now.  It stays in the sky through the night and is highly visible.  The object is stationary and is emmtting red, white and blue flashing lights that are very noticable with binoculars.  We thought we were going crazy until finding this site and seeing the same thing was posted from someone in Wisconsin.  It appears to be patriotic in nature although it is creepy, considering we are nearing 9-11 again.  We would like to know what this is and get an explanation from someone.  this was witnessed by 3 others besides myself.;41.2946;-92.6442
