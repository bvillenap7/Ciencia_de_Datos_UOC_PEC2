There was a large glowing light in the south west part of the sky above the tree line.  It was moving down at a slight angle very slowly and smoothly.  The light was red, glowing and very large.  It could have been one light or several lights so bright it appeared to be one.  Another witness thought it looked like a fireball.  I went outside and there was no noise.  The light suddenly disappeared.  I only witnessed this for roughly 25 seconds but it was unlike anything I have ever seen.;41.2946;-92.6442
