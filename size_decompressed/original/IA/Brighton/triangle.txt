dark triangle UFO,  with  three white lights and circle of red lights.;2005-02-16 23:00:00;one minute;dark triangle UFO,  with  three white lights and circle of red lights. My wife and I were driving home on the gravel road about half a mile from the Skunk River, about 200 feet from highway 92, two miles north of the town of Brighton, on the right side of the road about 100 feet above us, I saw a dark grey tiangle shape with a dim plain light on each of the crafts three points, I looked back to see if my kids were still awake , and two seconds latter it vanished. The craft we saw did not make any noise. This craft appeared to be very big.   My wife witnessed it, but she said she saw a circle of red light atached beneath the triangle. The event lasted about one minute. This is the first time in our lifes that either of us have ever seen a UFL up close.;41.1513;-91.8264
