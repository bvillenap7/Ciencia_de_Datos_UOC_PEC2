On the area where the farmer had the field, two miles from anything and in govt. set aside for the past ten years or so we took soil and plant samples inside the area and outside the area for comparison they were immediately sealed in bags and you may have them if you wish. pictures were also taken along with video. don,t know what else to add but our area has been really going weirdr in the past couple of weeks. well let us know if you want the samples or no thanks for your time. I will send a map of the area or what ever else you need.;41.1513;-91.8264
