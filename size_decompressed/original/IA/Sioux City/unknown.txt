Unknown craft observed with red blinking lights;2015-10-20 10:00:00;10 minutes;Unknown craft observed with red blinking lights Went out to smoke about 10 p.m. and saw an object off to the east with a panel of red blinking lights moving east quickly.  It looked strange so I called my son to come see it also as he is a science major in college..  It went on about a mile then turned south and disappeared.  He said it was far larger than a drone, and totally silent.;42.4980353260869;-96.3867570652173
