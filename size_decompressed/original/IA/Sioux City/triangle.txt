Triangular shapes that only I could see.;1996-07-15 22:00:00;10 seconds;Triangular shapes that only I could see. I was driving on the intersate with my girlfriend, at the time, and one of her friends.  It was at night, fairly nice weather.  I am driving and I see three glowing lights hovering about 50ft from my car.  I couldn't tell if it was one craft or three.  There were 3 lights that were hoveing and were making a triangular shape.  I turned to my girlfriend and asked her what it was.  She replied with Whats what?.  I asked her again and she did not see it.  I kept asking her if she could see the craft and made sure she did not see anything.  Very odd experience.  Her friend in the back seat was wondering what we were talking about and she said she didn't see anything either.  This really was insane.  It was very obvious that there were three triangular lights hovering above.  Why the two girls in my car could not see it I have no idea.  The lights stayed in one spot and I kept driving and they did not follow.  I wasn't sure what to think.  I was not on any drugs nor was I drinking.  I decided to keep my mouth shut due to that fact the others didn't see it and it would just be a silly thing for people to beleive but about a week later my girlfriend asked me what that night was all about.  She asked me what was going on that night and to this day I saw something in the sky, very close to my car but somehow the other two in the car couldn't see them.  Very confusing, but I don't know what else to say but I saw the lights. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  Date is approximate.  PD));42.4980353260869;-96.3867570652173

It was about 22:30 and I was goimg out my back door I looked up to check out the stars and saw this triangle shaped object flying over head. It was totally black and flat. it made no sound, and went over, about the speed of a hellicopter. and about 400 to 600 yrds up. it was a clear night and all we saw was a black triangle covering up the stars as it went by.;42.4980353260869;-96.3867570652173
They made a triangular formation.;2009-06-20 20:30:00;30 minutes;They made a triangular formation. I and two friends were stargazing in Sioux City, Iowa.  At about 8:30 PM, when we noticed a triangular shaped craft moving at an extremely high speed, at a very high altitude.  It had a red-yellow light, and zig-zagged.  Then it stopped and hovered for a while.   Then we noticed another one come and do the same thing.  And then another one came and did the same thing. the crafts seemed to make a triangular formation.  I ran inside to get my telescope.   When I came back out, my two friends and I looked up to see they had vanished.  About three minutes later, they returned to sky.   About fifteen minutes later, they left at incredible speed up into the sky, and we did not see them again.;42.4980353260869;-96.3867570652173
Was outside late at night in a slightly drizziling rain when i caught sight of a triangulare object in the sky.;2011-05-17 01:30:00;15 seconds (approx.);Was outside late at night in a slightly drizziling rain when i caught sight of a triangulare object in the sky. It was sprinkling out and I was on my annual nightly walk around the block when I felt as if there was static electricity making the hair on my head stand on end.  Having heard that this is a indication that you might possibly be struck by lighting, I looked up in the sky out of fear.  There about 10 o’clock from my position I saw what appeared to me at first to be street lights. Upon closer examination I realized that the figure was to far away to be streetlights and it appeared to be drifting lazily toward the twelve O’ Clock position.  It was a pizza shaped outline in the clouds with about 8 spheres of light lining its shape evenly. This shape continued to drift for about 5 seconds more in complete silence and abruptly was enveloped in the clouds.  The light spheres lining the shape were eventually enveloped in the clouds and I lost sight of it at which point the static electricity feeling left me. I stood around dumbstruck for about 15 more minutes before I realized that it wasn’t coming back and headed on my way back to home.;42.4980353260869;-96.3867570652173
A triangular UFO was found hovering in the sky and remained there for several minutes until flying out of sight.;2013-06-16 22:30:00;10-15 minutes;A triangular UFO was found hovering in the sky and remained there for several minutes until flying out of sight. I went outside the house at around 10:30 PM to find a bright object floating in the sky. It was stationary, but also flickered and looked like it was changing colors.  It was very strange-looking, but I thought it might be a star.  After watching it for many minutes and calling out a second person to view it, I got a pair of binoculars (7x50) from inside the house to get a better look at it.  With the binoculars I was able to see the object in much greater detail. From what I could tell, it was triangular in shape, with at least three lights (one on each side, one in the middle).  The colors of these lights slowly alternated between red and white when seen through binoculars, but the object looked mostly white (pulsating) without binoculars.  At around the same time I started watching with binoculars, the object began to move across the sky in a straight path towards us (the two witnesses). At one point during this flight, an actual plane flew under it (I think there was a lot of distance between the two, but I’m not sure).  The plane and unidentified object were very different from each other.  The plane was closer to the ground than the other object.  The plane was much smaller, went out of view much faster, and the blinking lights on the plane were much clearer.  The unidentified object took 2-5 minutes to fly across the sky over the house and go out of view.  From what I could tell, there was no noise coming from the craft.  The entire sighting lasted approximately 10 to 15 minutes.;42.4980353260869;-96.3867570652173
