We were coming up on a farmer's house and both of us yelled out, What's that?  We pulled off to the side of the road and turned the car off.  We watched A UFO hovering over the farmer's house, very close to the roof.  Then it slowly started moving towards us.  We just sat in our car and watched.  It moved to my side of the car and stopped.  I believe it was looking at us and we at them.  It had a few small lights and the sound didn't sound like anything I have heard before and was very quiet.  After a couple minutes it started moving across the highway and over a corn field.  After a matter of seconds it went very fast and disappeared in the distance over corn fields.  Signed Observer.;42.4980353260869;-96.3867570652173
