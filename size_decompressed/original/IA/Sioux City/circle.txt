4 bright orange balls of light moving silently through the sky - about the height a helicopter would fly.;2014-01-13 18:00:00;2 minutes;4 bright orange balls of light moving silently through the sky - about the height a helicopter would fly We were driving south on Jones Street, and when we got to the 38th street intersection, we noticed two very bright orange balls in the sky to the west of us.  They caught our attention, so we drove in the direction of them, and were on a north/south street (Jackson). There we saw three, bright, round orange balls above us in the sky, moving from south to north.  They looked like they were about the height that a helicopter would fly.  They were a solid, bright orange, with no flickering, and made no sound.  They flew parallel to each other, came lower, then flew apart, went higher, then back together – we thought they might collide, but then they suddenly changed directions and flew off very fast.  One went northwest, one went northeast, and it looked like the third one just went higher in the sky.  There were a lot of trees, so we lost sight of the ones that went northwest and northeast, and the one that went higher in the sky disappeared from our view as w! ell.  We did stop our vehicle and get out, and as the “objects” flew, they were totally silent.  It was about 7:05 p.m., and the whole viewing lasted only a couple of minutes.  We didn’t get any photos or videos – we were actually too awe struck watching and trying to figure out what they were, and by the time I was in a position to take a video, they were gone.  So we continued around several blocks to Outer Drive, and headed east.  Over the trees along the south side of Outer Belt Drive, we saw one more bright orange light. It appeared to be somewhat higher than the others we had seen and was moving very fast in a straight line from south to north – I would say it was moving faster than you would see a plane fly.  We didn’t stop that time, as there was no safe place to pull over on the road in the dark.  I have never witnessed anything remotely close to this.  I searched online and saw a several videos posted by people who have experienced similar sightings in other parts of the country. I'm positive it was not a plane or helicopter or meteor -- it was something very out of the ordinary.  Drones? UFO’s?  Hard to tell…;42.4980353260869;-96.3867570652173
Shocking 15 satellite like objects flying in the night sky in pattern one after another.  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-03-20 21:30:00;5 minutes;Shocking 15 satellite like objects flying in the night sky in pattern one after another. Multiple UFO sighting in Sioux City, IA.  My girlfriend and I counted approximately 15 satellite like objects flying one after another across the night sky on March 20, 2020.  Objects were flying in the same direction spaced apart in equal distances.  Only 2 or 3 were visible at a time.  They all appeared at the same point in the sky.  They also disappeared at the same point in the sky.  Each object was visible for about 20 second or so.  I would say they looked to be just seconds behind one another.  Objects were flying in the exact same path in the same direction.  Other commercial planes where flying by which gave a great comparison to how much higher in the sky the ufo objects were.  I have never seen anything like this. I have seen satellites that look similar but never so many one after another after another. 	&#9702;42.4980353260869;-96.3867570652173
