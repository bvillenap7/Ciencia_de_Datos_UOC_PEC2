Disappearing lights.;2004-07-24 23:00:00;15 minutes;disseappearing lights at first it was on solid bright light, coming from the north, traveling pretty fast. it was a solid light until it got above us, and then it stopped and was flashing, or it moved away. this was really high up. then we saw about 6 more lights, one of them looked like a cop car in space, circling the sky.  All of the others ended up disappearing also, but not as dramatically as the first one.;42.4980353260869;-96.3867570652173
Outside on breezeless night with neighbors talking when several lights appeared across the sky.;2007-06-19 23:00:00;30 minutes;Outside on breezeless night with neighbors talking when several lights appeared across the sky. The objects that were seen started out as a bright light beneath the moon.  Two smaller bright lights broke off from the bigger light and moved left across the sky following behind a flashing red light to another bright light that had a ring of haze around it.  The flashing red light flew right through the other bright light, but the two smaller ones disappeared into the bright light with the haze around it.  Once the smaller lights disappeared the flashing red light sped off and then it too disappeared.  Two minutes later a flashing yellow light appeared.  When looking at these lights they formed a triangle in the sky.  The bright light beneath the moon went out and then came back on when an airplane flew near it.  All the observers were enjoying the nice weather and talking outside their apartments.  None of these observers were under any kind of influence of either drugs or alcohol.  At least two of the observers have open minds that we are not alone in the universe and it could be UFOâ€™s that they saw.  None of the observers have ever seen anything like this before.;42.4980353260869;-96.3867570652173

3 white lights turn to 1 and wobble in the sky;2010-11-04 07:00:00;30-45 seconds;3 white lights turn to 1 and wobble in the sky I had just woken up for the day, and went outside to have a cigarette.  The sky was still dark, and I could see many stars (facing south), including one that was very bright.  Then I realized it wasn't a star at all because it was moving, and as I watched, I could see three bright white lights clustered together, it was still moving from south to north and upward into the sky. I could no longer see three lights but one again, and it was wobbling or warbling on its path.  My husband came outside at this time, and i asked him if he could see it, he said yes and that it was not blinking like a plane should blink. We watched it until it got smaller and smaller and we could no longer see it.  Then to the east in the sky, we saw and heard a plane and a helicopter traveling on the same path as the white light, as if the plane and copter were pursuing the source of the light.;42.4980353260869;-96.3867570652173
Bright orange lights taking an unusual flight pattern and then disappearing in the same area in the sky.;2011-09-10 23:20:00;2-3 minutes;Bright orange lights taking an unusual flight pattern and then disappearing in the same area in the sky. My boyfriend witnessed bright orange lights in the sky & ran into the house to wake me up.  He told me he didn't want to be the only one to see the lights.  The lights took an unusual flight pattern and all disappeared in the same area of the sky.  There wasn't any noise coming from them to suggest they were some type of airplane.  The orange lights were much brighter then something you would typically see in the sky.  They all took a similar flight pattern but did not appear to be part of an aircraft formation.  Never in my life have I witnessed something like this before!;42.4980353260869;-96.3867570652173

We were on the farm and had very good view of other planes off in the distance.All we could see was a big,round,white light,no other colors of any kind,it traveled clear across the sky in a very short time. No trails of any kind behind it as it sped across the sky. Flew much lower than normal aircraft do. We could hear it as it passed over us and it didnt appear to be a shooting star of any kind;42.4980353260869;-96.3867570652173
Late at night, I saw a very large red light that traveled quickly across the sky and disappeared.;2021-01-22 04:00:00;5 minutes;Late at night, I saw a very large red light that traveled quickly across the sky and disappeared. I woke in the night and the light outside seemed bright. We have large West facing windows in the living room, I had fallen asleep on the couch. I looked out the window, just saw the bright yellow moon, which explained the brightness.  But then, a very large red light appeared in the distance. It was nearly the size of the moon, and yet, far away enough I knew it wasn't over any of the houses in our neighborhood. It would occasionally turn white, and become much smaller, then then flare back into red. For as far away as it had to be, it was moving really quickly. It paused twice and held position.  I thought perhaps it was a helicopter, but the light was so large, if it was that close I would have heard it. It was traveling north, and eventually moved up until I couldn't see it any longer.;42.4980353260869;-96.3867570652173
