Wife asked what light was on east side of Highway.I answered it must be a jet from Epply Airfield. After about 30 secs, was obvious the craft was not moving.  Apprx. 40 cars slowed to about 30 mph in a 65mph zone ahead of us. Possibly also observing object. 4 vehicles stopped on Northbound side of I- 29 and out of cars with hazards blinking obviously looking at object. Object did a Backward Sommersault and lifted up into the clouds and was gone. Looked for it to reappear in break in the spotty cloudiness but saw nothing more. Noted Helicopter coming from the direction of Omaha metro.  Description of object: Saw only Lights. Bright white lights, one in middle, three on each side gradually decening order.  At first sight thought it was lights on wings of Jet. Wife said it looked like a Crown.  I say it resembled a Diamond Anniversary ring. Very bright white lights, very clear and brilliant.  Were it not for the stationary position and ultimate Slow Backflip and straight upward departure I would have said it was a Jet.Very strange.  Can't believe we saw one. Seen by me,wife,2 kids.;42.4980353260869;-96.3867570652173
Red flash and a flying saucer;2004-02-27 03:11:00;20 minutes;Red flash and a flying saucer Yesterday I was camping with my buddies and as none of us could sleep, we thought we would go walking by the creek. After a few hours of wandering around, we saw a red flash of light to the west of us. Of course, we started to walk over there. I looked at my watch and it read 3:11. Then there was another red flash of light, and my watch then read 3:31. We were a little freaked out, so we went back to the tent, where we saw that one of my friends had several red dots on his back that looked almost like mosquitoe bites. We then discovered that we all had several of these dots. That night I had a strange dream about being brought on a saucer shaped ship. The next morning, all my frinds had had the same exact dream. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness asserts that he has photos of the wounds, but we have not received copies, yet.  Witness describes self as a journalist.  PD));42.4980353260869;-96.3867570652173

It travelled at about 400 ft in elevation in a N.E. direction where it joined another craft of same description. Where they joined was a much higher elevation(approx 3000 ft). The object(s) moved slightly faster than current wind speeds by my estimation but was obiously not a traditional aircraft. The first craft had no wings, or markings, it was very plain, shaped like two bowls joined together rim to rim, one bowl being shiny metallic, and the other being flat white or light grey. It seemed to rock gently back and forth as it met the other craft which waited for the first craft. Once joined(within 200 ft of each other)they proceeded N.N.E out of my sight behind trees. I do not claim to know what they were but give my word that my description is as accurate as I could explain.;42.4980353260869;-96.3867570652173

With binoculars you could see it was a flying saucer like object It was a clear blue sky in the middle of the afternoon.  I was outside smoking a cigarette.  I looked up and noticed a plane flying high in the sky.  The plane crossed the path of what looked like the brightest star I have ever seen.  But it was the middle of the day.  I called my neighbor over to look.  He also thought it was strange.  He grabbed his binoculars and several of us looked at the object with binoculars.  We all came to the same conclusion that this was some sort of saucer like craft.  The sun was shining off of it brightly but you could clearly see it had shapes and edges and something protruding from its bottom.  There is no doubt about it that it was a ship of some sort.  Whether it was alien I do not know.  We watched it for hours waiting for it to disappear but eventually we gave up.  We thought we could see it moving on it’s own slightly because it did change locations in the sky over time but it was not drifting like a ballon would.  It had its own cont! rol and was definitely in our atmosphere.  I did take pictures and video but without some enhancement it looks like a star to the naked eye.  I know everyone I tell thinks it’s just a satellite but It did not move or look like any satellite I have ever seen.  I was surprised and frustrated at how long it was visible.;42.4980353260869;-96.3867570652173
