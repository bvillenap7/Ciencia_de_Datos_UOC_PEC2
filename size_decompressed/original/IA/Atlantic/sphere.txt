On Oct. 31, 2001 While I was on my work break at about 8:35 P.M.  I was driving through the park in my town and a glowing blue sphere-like object quickly punched in and out of some low-lying clouds almost directly over me.  It appeared to be going forward at a very high speed.  The whole event lasted no more than a second.  The blue glow was a very soft light, and appeared to be humming.  I had my stereo up to high to hear anything, but the perfectly linear path looked as if it moved effortlessly and quietly. At first I thought that it was a crashing airplane, but that was just the angle I was at, and also it was moving way to fast.;41.4038;-95.0137
