Followed them approximately 13 minutes, keeping them in sight. Seemed to be a mist surrounding them. I saw a hint of orange. Each object had a bright white blinking light. However they were not blinking in sequence. Indicating to me that they were independent of each other. The objects seemed to move very slowly and as I observed them I believe that I saw the same type of lights somewhat dimmer and as I think about it, it seems they were in front of the brighter lights.;41.4038;-95.0137
