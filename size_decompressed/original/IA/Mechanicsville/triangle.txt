V-shaped large hovering object.;1998-06-10 20:00:00;2 minutes;V shaped large hovering object Leaving a friend's house, holding my then 1 yr old daughter, I noticed the trees in her yard swaying like crazy, but it wasn't windy out.  I looked up and saw lights along two sides coming to a point hovering above and to the side of her house.  No noise at all.  I got scared and ran inside to get her, she came out and it had moved to another location but we could still see it.   We jumped on my car and tried to follow it, but it  just disappeared.   Scariest thing I have ever had happen to me in my life. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));41.9027;-91.2748
