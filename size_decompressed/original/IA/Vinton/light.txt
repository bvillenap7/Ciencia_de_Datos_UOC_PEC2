BRIGHT LIGHTS FAST MOVING IN THE SKY;2004-01-27 23:20:00;3 minutes;BRIGHT LIGHTS FAST MOVING IN THE SKY I was driving down a gravel road near our home and out of nowhere I saw 2 bright white lights in the sky ahead of me. One was to my right and one to my left.The lights were similar to a large aircraft you would see flying very low, but the speed and agility could only be described as similar to a helicopter. They both moved at the exact speed coming towards each other meeting directly in front of me but still at a distance from me and then immediately with the exact speed started descending down. At that point I stopped my truck and said to myself, What are they going to do? Land on the highway? I was a little nervous to see what they were, but again started moving forward and soon realized that they were gone. I didn't see any lights to my right or my left. There should have been lights trailing off in some direction somewhere, but nothing. They were gone just as fast as they appeared.;42.1725;-91.994
