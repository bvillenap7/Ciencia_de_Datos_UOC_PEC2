It was somewhat low in the sky and flew towards the west side of town and disappeared.   When it went over us there was absolutely no sound.

I'm hoping someone else will see this report and come forward.  I got a picture on my phone but I couldn't zoom in very far and it just looks like a red dot.;42.1725;-91.994
