Sequential orange lights in night southeastern night sky Keokuk Iowa 8/30/2007;2007-08-30 20:30:00;10 minutes;Sequential orange lights in night southeastern night sky Keokuk Iowa 8/30/2007 Approximately 8:30pm 8/30/2007 10 miles north of Keokuk Iowa on highway 218 I saw what I thought was a airplane turning on landing lights for final approach to runway 28 at Keokuk Municipal Airport. There were three lights.  I took them to be a nose gear light and wing lights.  Then they started a sequence from left to right, going on and off in sequence.  After several minutes my wife asked if I had seen those lights. I told her I was glad she was there because I had been watching them already and wanted to be sure I wasn't seeing things.  This pattern of coming on and off in a left to right sequence continued until we lost sight well inside city limits of Keokuk, Iowa. The lights appeared to stay in a relative position to our moving van. No sudden movement, no change in color, no shape shifting. For well over 10 mminutes we observed this. Orange in color.  Would like to know if any other sightings took place that night.  Must have been seen by other people because of elevation and position in night sky.;40.406;-91.3997

I was standing on my back patio looking east over a tree in my back yard when a large , extremely bright ball of light shot over the tree.  At first I thought it was a falling star but I noticed it was way to bright to be on, when my eyes caught up to it I noticed it was probably only a few thousand feet in the air and it was not traveling in a straight line but a real faint swerving motion. The object was not descending nor elevating but traveling straight across the sky south to southeast , the object was traveling at such a tremedous speed I had never seen anything move that fast other than maybe a shooting star across the sky.  I caught the ball of light for only 3 to 5 seconds as it faded in and out then disappeared in thin air the closer it got to the moon.  The moon was very bright , almost a full moon with no clouds in the sky .;40.406;-91.3997

It appered to be moving directly north of us  It was moving very slowly.  Slower than any thing I've ever seen in the sky except maybe a hot air baloon.   It was traveling level at a fixed point in the sky.  The light began dimming on and off for a couple of seconds then comletely turned off then just a second or two later we saw what appered to be a beam of direct light shot to the horizon from the exact point in the sky where the object would and should have been.   The light is very hard to describe.  It was as strong at some points as a laser and as dim at other times as a candle   I dont know me and my ex-girlfriend talked about it all the time and we couldn't figure out what it was,   It still kinda scares me to even think about it.;40.406;-91.3997
