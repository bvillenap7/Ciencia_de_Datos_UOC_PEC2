ufo seen in Keokuk Iowa;2017-09-26 22:45:00;1 minute;ufo seen in Keokuk Iowa I was heading north on main street on my way to work and it was really cloudy and dark .  I had to stop at a stop light at 14th and main on my motorcycle.  while i wait, I'm glancing around and i notice 2 red lights and 2 green lights to my left about a mile away and a few hundred yards high.   at first i thought it was the water tower it was about that high in the air but it was to the left of the tower in the Kilbourne park area.  so then I'm thinking could it be a helicopter, but it couldn't be there was no sound and the red and green lights were on top and bottom.  at that time it just took off at a fast rate of speed in my direction and actually went over my head.  It made no sound.   It happened so fast i didn't even think of taking a picture, and i was so scared i sped off without seeing where it went.;40.406;-91.3997
