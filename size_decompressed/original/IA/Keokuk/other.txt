Only the outline was visible, as it appeared you could see the sky through it.   Appeared to be appr. 500-1000 feet above ground moving less than 100 miles per hour.  Absolutely no noise or lights were coming from it as it was traveling west to east.  The only explanation I could come up with is that it was some sort of military stealth (invisibility project).  I have been a pilot for years, and pretty good on judging altitudes and speeds in the air.;40.406;-91.3997
