Large round red-orange glowing or burning object, shooting very fast through the sky going north, bigger than a plane & faster.;2014-08-31 20:50:00;10 seconds;Large round red-orange glowing or burning object, shooting very fast through the sky going north, bigger than a plane & faster. My husband and I were looking at the stars, when all the sudden in the NW direction of the sky, we spotted this round object that was huge, much larger then an airplane and going much faster....it looked as though it was on fire or a burning object, it was a bright red-orange glow with black edges...it just kept going and going until it was out of sight headed North.   We were both in shock, never have seen anything like this.  We did not have a camera and didn't have time to get a pic, we were in such aahhh of it.   It was like a huge fireball rushing through the sky.  But it was HUGE and must have traveled hundreds a minute.   It also seemed to appear out of no where, it was just there..  Then shot across the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and she sounded to us to be both sincere, and sober-minded.  PD));41.5515999999999;-90.5016999999999
