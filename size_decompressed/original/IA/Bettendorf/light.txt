I was on my way home from work a few minutes before 4:00 a.m. on 6/28/1998.  As I drove up the street towards my driveway I noticed  2 lights about halfway up the east-southeast sky (they were located near the brightest early morning star), they were about twice the size of an average star (each light) and were very close together.  They were stationary for a few seconds, then dropped down maybe 10 degrees and then straight up and disappeared into the sky.  This all happened in a time span of less than 5 seconds.  I pulled into my driveway and jumped out but could not see any indications of where the lights went.  These lights moved very quickly and smoothly.;41.5515999999999;-90.5016999999999
Heavy Blue Light beamed down and chased family in house, simular to 50 foot wide search light.;1998-10-02 19:55:00;1 minute;Heavy Blue Light beamed down and chased family in house, simular to 50 foot wide search light. At 19:55 hour 10-02-98 a heavy blue light beam traveled straight down from the sky to cover the back patio, where my son and and wife were. the sudden silent heavy blue light scared them as it appeared out of no where.  this light was a strange light as it did not cast any shadows but was so bright that it hurt their eyes. They both ran into the house an called me to help them!  I grab a weapon and headed for the back yard where I found nothing but a semi cloudy night with a hazy moon and some bright stars showing through them.. They were both shaking with fear and it took several hours of my telling them it was just a reflection of the light from a police car going by. But I know police spot lights don't come from the sky and are not a heavy florescent blue that casts no shadows. This was just a strange experience that I can not really explain so I thought it might be worth reporting to you.;41.5515999999999;-90.5016999999999

At 2100 hours I was standing outside my house looking to the S.E.  A very. extreamely bright white light decended from the sky approximately one mile away.  (I have taken flying lessons and could not believe the brightness of the light.)  Then I could see some blue lights on either side of the bright white light.  The lighted object held in one position for about 50 seconds then proceeded slowly to the southeast.  There were no aircraft sounds. I called the local TV station to see if anyone else had reported something of this nature.  There were no reports at 2115 hours.;41.5515999999999;-90.5016999999999
Distant white stars moving across the sky typically S of the big dipper. ((NUFORC Note:  Overflight of satellites, we wonder?  PD)  );2012-06-19 22:45:00;45 seconds;Distant white stars moving across the sky typically S of the big dipper. I have been witnessing what appears to be distant white stars moving with controlled flight paths in the sky usually S of the big dipper.  These stars appear to be very high up and cross great portions of the sky in a matter of seconds.  This has been consistently observed on clear nights and at varying times (9:30PM - 3:30AM). The first incident was on 6/10 at approximately 3:30AM. I witnesses two distant white &quotstars&quot moving SE in the sky on paths where it appeared they could meet.  After about 15 seconds, they appeared to almost meet.  One turned very bright white as it stopped for a couple seconds and headed directly N across the entire sky in approximately 30 seconds before disappearing in to the horizon.  There were no erratic flight paths observed, just a short stop and a 90 degree change in flight.  The other &quotstar&quot maintained its path and was also lost in to the horizon. I can honestly rule out meteors or satellites by the distance, speed, no tracking lights, and directional flight/color change of the stars. The incident on 6/19 was similar, but involved two moving stars at separate times.  The first was seen flying E to W.   A few hours later I witnessed the second.  This was a very distant &quotstar&quot that flew S to N and either stopped or disappear directly S of the big dipper.  I did not see it continue past that area in the sky.  I maintained observation of the area, and approximately 5 minutes later witnessed the star reappear from the same area and cross the sky heading N in a matter of seconds. I have seen this on other nights and witnessed identified aircraft (shape,sound, tracking lights) flying toward or away from the Quad City Airport at a low altitude as a  star flew far far above, but in a similar relative direction. These &quotstars&quot are so distant that they can likely be observed in other states.  Just scale the sky facing W where the big dipper is to your right, observe S, and you will be able to see this for yourself!  Some times, I have seen movement within seconds of being outside!  It will take a very high powered camera to record this activity. ((NUFORC Note:  Overflight of satellites, we wonder?  PD)  );41.5515999999999;-90.5016999999999
Orange lights over the Quad Cites.;2016-11-15 20:10:00;2 minutes;Orange lights over the Quad Cites. This happened in the Quad cites, Bettendorf, IA, one of the cities.   While crossing the twin bridges from Ia to IL saw four orange lights flying over the top of my car this was not normal this I know.   There where four lights flying at the same speed going from west to east the same way the Mississippi river runs here.;41.5515999999999;-90.5016999999999

I called my sister to look out. phone 20:55 call lasted 1.5 min. a second orange light appeared out of the same direction heading West.  When the first light was just above me it made a wide turn and headed North. 3 or 4 seconds later the second light turned North. the first light faded out and the second one did at the same distance.  the light was the same brightness on approach as it was leaving.  (the light was the thing, not like a spot light)  NO SOUND. after a min. a plane came out of the North West and I could hear it, and see the wing, tail, and strobe light.;41.5515999999999;-90.5016999999999
