LIGHT APPEARED AFTER I WENT OUT TO CHECK ON WHAT KNOCKED DOWN OUR STACK OF FIRE WOOD. I WENT OUT THE FRONT DOOR OF THE HOUSE AND SNUCK AROUND TO THE BACK YARD.  ALL LIGHTS WERE OFF AND I TRIED TO SNEEK UP ON WHAT EVER CRIITER KNOCKED THE WOOD DOWN.  WELL I WAS MET BUY A FLOATING BALL OF LIGHT THAT APPEARED TO REACT TO MY EMOTIONS. WHEN I FIRST SAW IT I WAS VERY CURIOUS AND DELIGHTED, SO IT CAME CLOSER THEN I GOT SCARED AND THEN MAD, IT STOPPED DEAD IN ITS TRACKS THE SECOND I GOT MAD.  I MOVED FORWARD TO GET A CLOSER LOOK AND IT MOVED OFF QUICKLY AND JUST BLINKED OUT.  IT LEFT ME WITH CHILLS...  THE WHOLE THING LASTED ABOUT 5-7 MINUTES... BUT IT SURE WAS NEAT TO WATCH!;41.5515999999999;-90.5016999999999
