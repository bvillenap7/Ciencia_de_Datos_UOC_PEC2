High flying objects spotted on Interstate-80 in Iowa on Sept 16th 2007;2002-09-16 06:00:00;30 min;High flying objects spotted on Interstate-80 in Iowa on Sept 16th 2007 We were driving east on Interstate 80 in Iowa and it was very early in the morning, just getting light. I was watching what I thought might be a star but as I observed it, it's shape became more oblong and began to look more like a short contrail from a high flying jet but it did not appear to be moving or if it was moving it's movment  was very slow. I thought perhaps it's a comet? It was very high up.  We continued to watch as is it's shape began to look more like a V and we took a picture of it. You could not really see the object as much as what appeard to be it's trail.  We eventually passed under it at a very high altitude. Then my freind spotted two more of these high on the horizon and we eventually passed under each of them. They were odd looking, not really like a jet aircraft. I have a good picture I can submit.
