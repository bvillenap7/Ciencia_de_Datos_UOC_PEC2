High altitude orange light moving from zenith west to 30 degrees at incredible speed and rapidly fading.;2006-09-29 00:00:00;5 sec;High altitude orange light moving from zenith west to 30 degrees at incredible speed and rapidly fading. 5 27 AM. Was looking at Orion in SSE. Saw flash to right. Thot falling star. Looked it was still there. Saw from about zenith to 30 degrees above horizon. E to W. Orange slightly bigger than star. Kept thinking it would burn out. Couldn't believe how fast it was moving. Came into atmosphere above me, looked like it was very high. Moved about 60 degrees in 5 sec or less. Seemed to have a slight back and forth movement or it was an eye effect. For as high as it appeared to be it was incredibly fast. Gave me a creepy feeling that this thing wasn't normal. I've seen meteors, a bolide, a green fireball, satellites. I was outside 5 min before and after sighting. After saw a low level airplane moving NW to SE at slow speed. I am a member of MUFON.;43.4255;-95.1122
