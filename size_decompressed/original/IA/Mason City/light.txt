strange flying object;2005-10-06 06:00:00;5 minutes;strange flying object I saw a few friends walking to the gas station so i left my home and caught up to them .. i caught up to them at the end of a road that goes on to the highway.. i noticed a low flying plane about 100 yards away with one red light in the middle and flashing white lights on the sides..  right as i pointed it out to my friends and they turned their heads toward it, it came to a dead stop and the lights changed to just 2 lights one on each side.. they said my mind was playing tricks on me, but i knew what i saw, it was very strange..because it somehow knew that i pointed it out and right as my friends look at it .. it stops and changes its light pattern..  anyways.. we sat there staring at it for about a minute and it shot north flying at a very fast speed.. there were 3 lights on it blinking very fast one after another..  me and my friend left my other friend and started chasing it.. we ran a few blocks and saw it in an opening above the trees.. it changed its direction and looked like it was coming toward us.. at this time it was just one big light.. it kept getting bigger and bigger.. so i figured it was getting closer to us..  it whent out of our field of view behind a tree and dissapeared..  we wondered where it whent and all of the sudden it came out of nowhere in the opposite direction of us(east).. it flew by very fast and very low to the ground heading north.. it flew like a helicopter but was silent.. and also very fast.. just above the trees.. it whent out of our field of view behind a tree and dissapeared.. we haven't seen it since.. this is not my first experience with ufo's .. and its my friends 2nd experience seeing a ufo..;43.1506301886793;-93.1975528301887
Observed two steady red  lights for about one minute that moved slowly and faded out;2012-04-20 20:45:00;2 min;Observed two steady red  lights for about one minute that moved slowly and faded out On April 20 coming home from work at 8:45 pm I noticed through the windshield two red lights in the southwest sky at about a 50 degree elevation that seemed to be slowly moving. They were the color and size of what you'd see on a nearby radio tower but not flashing- steady and slowly moving to the south away from town.  I would say they were quite far away.  One was brighter.  As soon as I could I pulled over to take a picture with my iPhone but by the time I could get out of the truck only one was still visible and it slowly drifted away and dimmed to nothing.  I didn't get any picture.  The sky was clear with stars visible.  It was dark.  No other aircraft around.  This wasn't a satellite.  It was moving too slow for that.;43.1506301886793;-93.1975528301887
