acorn shaped with flames and a ring of white lights on bottom;2012-05-26 00:00:00;2 to 4 min.;acorn shaped with flames and a ring of white lights on bottom after hearing what i thought sounded like a car accident up the street i walked out on my front porch to investigate.across the road from us is a field of trees,rising up from behind the trees i saw what appeared to be an acorn shaped craft with flames coming out of the bottom with a ring of white lights around where the flames were coming out. right away i went back inside and told my wife &quotcome out here quick&quotshe did and witnessed it also,but she didn't see it in as much detail as i did as she's near sighted and i'm far sighted. we watched the object pass over head from south-east to north-west without making a sound and no flashing aircraft lights.i would guess at between 1,000 and 1,500 feet up.;43.1506301886793;-93.1975528301887
