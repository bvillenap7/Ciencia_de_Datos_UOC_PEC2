Slow moving orange/fireball.;2013-07-14 22:15:00;3 minutes;slow moving orange/fireball. On July 14th at about 22:15, I was walking out to my car and looked up to the sky and saw an orange/fireball looking sphere.  It started in the east and was moving slowly in a non set course.   After a few second of moving in several directions it seem to make a course for the north- north west.  While all of this was going on my neighbor had stepped outside and I asked him to confirm that what I was seeing wasnâ€™t in my mind.;43.1506301886793;-93.1975528301887
