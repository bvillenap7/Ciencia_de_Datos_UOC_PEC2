It was early in the am. and i was just sitting awake then suddenly, a very intense bright light was over the bus. I looked out the window and couldnt seen anything...the light was so bright. I heard no noise and i didnt see anything unusall other than the bus driver not stopping. After about 15 seconds of that bright light it was gone in a flash and i looked out the window and couldnt see any lighted objects. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was towards mars.  It had a vertical aura (light,stronger in the middle, but extending out up and down and getting weaker the farther it got out) coming from it and in the middle had what seemed to be small lights , they seemed to be moving around it also, after we noticed it the ufo began to move (hover?), it moved down and thats when we knew it couldnt have been anything from this planet. It sat in the same position for a minute then moved back up to its normal position. After a minute or so it then started to fly away, getting smaller and smaller till we couldnt see it anymore.  We knew it was a extraterrestrial spacecraft just by the way it moved, after it was gone and we couldnt see it anymore we waited and kept staring into the stars because we wanted to see it again, wishing that the moment wasnt over... about 30 minutes(maybe less) later after the ufo was spotted and it dissapeared the sun began to come up, and the stars were no longer visible so we stopped staring into the sky.;43.1506301886793;-93.1975528301887
