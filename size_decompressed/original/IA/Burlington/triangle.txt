Three bright lights in the form of a triangle with pin point lights emitted at corners.;2007-01-31 01:45:00;12 minutes;Three bright lights in the form of a triangle with pin point lights emitted at corners. Three extremely bright lights clustered in the shape of a triangle noted in the distant sky. I observed the object over a period of 12 minutes. The object exhibited a bouncing motion at times. Occasionally there where pin point lights that flashed at an extended distance from the three point configuration. There were no stars in the sky at the time of this sighted. You could however see the moon. I watched closely for 12 minutes and then laid back down. I couldn't sleep so I looked out the window again and the triangle formation was much further in the distance.  This is the second time that I have winessed this type of object in the sky. The first time was approximately 10 years ago. At that time the object appeared to be a greater distance from the earth and did not have the pin point lights extending from a distance. At that time I was with a friend and we thought it might possibly be a satillite but had never seen anything like it in the sky before.;40.8113;-91.1156000000001

I got out of car and took 5 random pictures, then got back into the car and continued taking pictures.  When I got home,  I downloaded the pictures from my camera to my computer, and right away noticed objects in the sky.  After zooming in on photos#4 and #6, I started seeing fairly clear unidentified aerial objects.  Some of the objects are clear, and some of them are very blurry but you can see them and the general shape in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  We cannot identify the object.  PD));40.8113;-91.1156000000001
