Both my friend and I were outside getting a breath of fresh air and looking at the stars in the country when we saw a huge flickering amber light.  My friend asked me what star it was.  I said it didnt look like a star let alone a planet.  So we kept watching for at least another min or two and realized the object was moving up at a fairly good pace.  No other objects were noticed in the sky at the time.  But as we watched my friend turned to me and said wouldnt that be weird if it just disappeared?  I said well yeah!.  Just then we look back and its gone and several planes were seen around the same area. We rushed inside to tell more people but no one wanted to go outside in the cold.  And as we got back, it reapeared and then again disappeared for a second time.  Planes were all over the place flying in different directions and sometimes in a pattern together.  And they all were flying very very slowly.  These planes didnt make hardly a sound though either until they! were right above your head.;40.8113;-91.1156000000001
