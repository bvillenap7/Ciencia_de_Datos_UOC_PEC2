unbelievable, five large orange/yellow bright spheres appearing one after another moving quickly across the sky and disappearing.;2001-02-22 19:45:00;30 seconds;unbelievable, five large orange/yellow bright spheres appearing one after another moving quickly across the sky and disappearing. Driving on highway 30 west of Carroll I looked up and saw two bright orange lights, one after another thinking it was fireworks, about five seconds later five more lights appeared in succession one after another. They moved on quickly and disappeared. It was the weirdest thing I have ever seen. After I compared it to the size of the starlights, they were at least 20 times bigger. I am freaking out and my girlfriend thinks I am crazy. I have heard about people seeing things like this in the sky and I never thought I would see one. It was definitely not an airplane or fireworks. I am at a loss. Thanks.;42.0713;-94.8746
