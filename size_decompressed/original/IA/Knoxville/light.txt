Lights in the sky;2020-08-20 21:00:00;1 minute;Lights in the sky Me and a co worker were outside discussing certain events in politics and stuff.  He proceeds to tell me that that is only star he has seen tonight so I look up and I responded that is no star it was slowly moving across the sky an orange yellowish light and then it vanished.  So when I got off work I told my wife and she proceeded to tell me that around the same hour she saw a bright white light do the same.  She said she didn't  think was a helicopter or anything because it did not make any noise.;41.3106;-93.0961000000001
