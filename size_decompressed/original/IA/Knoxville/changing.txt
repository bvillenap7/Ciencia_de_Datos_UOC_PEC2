At or around 12/15/94 I witnessed a peculiar event.  Through a windowed door, I observed a light about the brillance of a bright star through the branches of a tree.  As I watched, it began to dip and sway as if in a pendulam (sp?) fashion, seemingly tightly controlled.  After about thirty seconds, it stop and formed into an extremely brilliant arrowhead.  /\ (closest approximation I can make).  It was completely illuminated white along the edges leading to the point, but dark along the other edge.  Even so, I sensed that it was a complete triangle shape.  It also appeared to have a faint white line of light straight down its middle leading to just before the edges of the object.  I stepped a couple steps to my left to my living room window.  By the time I had the object in view again, it had turned on its side to a < as if following my movement.  At this time, I lose track of about two hours of time.  The next thing I remember is looking back up at a normal star.  From the right, two fast moving I assume at this point planes approached.  From my vantage it appeared as though one was on top of the other as in like a colon : but spaced out a lot more. The top plane actually transvered directly through the light of the star I had observed.  For a split second, they were as one.  This was the only observation I had and no more oddities have occured.;41.3106;-93.0961000000001
