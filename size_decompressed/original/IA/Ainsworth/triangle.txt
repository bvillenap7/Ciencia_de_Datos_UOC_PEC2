2 Triangle shaped crafts with red lights over Ainsworth, Iowa.;2013-05-11 22:00:00;2 minutes;2 Triangle shaped crafts with red lights over Ainsworth Iowa . Saturday May 11 2013 at approximately 10pm. my wife our 13 year old son & myself were enjoying the beautiful night with a small campfire & looking at the stars when we spotted a satellite traveling very fast from the Northwest to Southeast direction. At the same time we noticed 2 triangle shaped crafts directly behind the satellite but much lower.  The crafts were side by side with solid red lights & made a low humming sound but not loud.  We watched the crafts for approximately 2 minutes until the crafts were out of sight .;41.3202;-91.5472
TRIANGLE OBJECTS HOVERING IN CORNFIELD.;2013-12-18 04:00:00;3 minutes;TRIANGLE OBJECTS HOVERING IN CORNFIELD. I went out to start my truck to let it warm up around 4am when i heard a low humming sound coming from around back of the house.   As i walked around back i seen 2 triangle objects with solid orange colored lights in the south cornfield.  These objects were approximately 300yrds out & were hovering approximately 150ft. above a small grove of trees.   The objects looked  to be about the size of larger personal airplane.  One of these objects had a blue-ish beam of light coming down from the middle of it that seemed to be tracing the outer edge of the tree line.   After about two minutes the objects started to rise straight upward then headed east approximately a mile then making what looked like a perfect 90% turn, headed straight back west at high rate of speed then vanished.;41.3202;-91.5472
TRIANGLE CRAFT SEEN AGAIN IN AINSWORTH!;2014-03-10 04:00:00;3 minutes;TRIANGLE CRAFT SEEN AGAIN IN AINSWORTH! I was getting ready for work shortly before 4am when i felt as if the house was vibrating.  I instinctively looked out the south window because that is area ive seen strange lights & objects in the sky before.  I seen a single triangle shaped craft approximately 350yrds from my home slowly rising up from the field.  The redish yellow lights were slowly flashing.   I asked my wife to come witness this & she made the comment of having a harsh metal taste in her mouth.  My two dogs were acting very franrtic & scratching  at the front  door.  As the craft lifted slowly into the sky the house was pulsating or vibrating. The craft lifted to approximately 500ft. the lights on the craft went dark & with a slight boom sound it was gone.  I assume it went in the direction the craft was pointing in which was south.  I have reported this activity twice before to this web site with no results.  Should i lie & say i seen little green people running around in my yard so it sounds more believable ?  Sorry if the truth is boring & i will not doctor it up to make it more appealing !;41.3202;-91.5472
