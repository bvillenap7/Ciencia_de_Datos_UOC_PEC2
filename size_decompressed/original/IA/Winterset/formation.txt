3 lights in perfect formation;2013-08-01 18:00:00;unknown;3 lights in perfect formation August 2013 I was tracking a storm passing through Madison County Iowa.   I am a local photographer and I was just capturing the landscape along with the clouds moving through.  I did not notice this formation until I had uploaded the photo to my computer.  Come to think about it, I had my truck parked along a dirt road.  I kept it running while I quickly captured my shot.  During my shot my truck had shut off.
