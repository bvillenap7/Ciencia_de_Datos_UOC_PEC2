It was at about 11:30 pm on the 26th of august and i was out for a nightly stroll and on my way back home, i looked up in the sky and there were what appeared to be one saucer-disk shaped object about as big as anything that i have ever seen, and it made no noise what so ever, just looked like it was attached by a string, the next surprise was there were 2 more just like it and they made no noise and no lights were visible on those not till they got to where i could actually see them, and the lights seem to change colors from red, to white, and then a off green color, I remembered something from a movie (Close Encounters Of The 3rd Kind) and i made several movements with my hands and they seemed to respond back to me, then it got really wierd, while my focus was on the other 2, i felt like there was something behind me, so i turned around, and there was a small creature, hard to really describe but, it was about 3 1/2- 4 feet tall, a pear shaped head, huge eyes, and completley, gray colored, no visible mouth, it seemed to me communicating with me via telepahy.  the little being and i were sending message back and forth for about 5 min or so, i mean it seems longer, and it said, and i say it cause there were no visible sexual organs, the creature said that they were not hear to harm us and they are just here, to view and observe us, the being also said that the roswell incident that had everyone talking about actually did happen and they way to prove it is to go to Roswell, and there is an abandoned underground room, that is where they had kept the flying disk since 1947, i tried to ask the creature how it knows all of this and the responce that i got was they have been trying to get their ships, back and they have quietly looking in on area 51 since the time of the wreck in July of 1947.  So with all of that the being told me it turned and went quietly back to the ship and the 3 took off but not before a goodbye light show.;41.3439;-94.0076
