Large, horizontal, whitish rectangle seen during the day.;2009-08-15 10:00:00;6 sec;Large, horizontal, whitish rectangle seen during the day. Eldora, Iowa. Traveling west, in our minivan, from Eldora, Ia., 10 am on Hwy 175.  Approximately August 15th, 2009. 4 Miles west of Eldora, my wife and I both saw a large whitish, horizontal, rectangle shaped object traveling south to north just over the western horizon.  It's a hilly area, maybe 5 miles from us.  Quickly out of sight, 100+ MPH?  The length of the object was about 6 times longer than its height.  From the distance of the object, I estimate it was 250 feet long. It had no tail, no wings. It was a simple horizontal rectangle with sharp crisp edges.  From our vantage point, no depth of the object could be determined. We have been to airshows and live across from a small grass airstrip and have seen many homemade aircraft.  Never seen anything like this before or since. Looked on your site for a report of something similar.  Have yet to find any but will continue to look. Recently discovered your site and wanted to share our information. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, althought witness does not indicate that fact.  PD));42.3594;-93.094
