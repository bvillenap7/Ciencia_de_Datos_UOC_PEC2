This green ring/light only lasted only 2 seconds.  After the green light, I looked up and saw a huge green ring,.. Only higher up and smaller. .when we saw the there was loud pop, almost like lightning. .I didn't have any more experiences, but the same friend friend who saw the small ring heard more pops and saw some strange creature as she was walking  home.;42.3594;-93.094
Green light and green ring.;2016-11-10 21:53:00;30 seconds;Green light and green ring. There was a green light that lit up al around us. It made a pop sound, kind of like lightning but different.  My friend looked up right after that and saw a very large green ring.  She claimed it was the size of a baseball diamond.  I looked up about 20 seconds later and saw a ring higher up and about the size of a penny.  I heard two more pops but no lights or rings were seen.  A strange sighting of something unknown was later seen by me.  It seemed to be kind of like a strange dog but larger.
