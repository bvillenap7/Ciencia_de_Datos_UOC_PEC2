Two witness one amber fireball track south over the Quad Cities;2012-06-21 23:05:00;90 seconds;Two witness one amber fireball track south over the Quad Cities We saw one amber/orange ufo as we were looking out our west-facing window.  It was low in the sky and moving north to south.  No sound came from it.   Our first thought was that it was an airplane on fire.  (There is a mid-size airport in Moline--to our southwest--so we thought that perhaps it was going to make an emergency landing.)  As it tracked south, we moved to our south-facing window.  It eventually moved into the southern horizon and we lost it in our neighbors' tree line.;41.5446345679012;-90.5837160493827
Fleet of fireball type ufo seen!;2013-07-14 23:00:00;10 minutes;Fleet of fireball type ufo seen! First witnessed 3 craft ascending at about a 90 degree angle in a strait line, then dimming out remaining slightly visible to the naked eye until reaching a certain altitude.  This phenomenon was repeated several times over a 10-20 minute period, with the groups ranging from 2-4 (of the u.f.o.).   The night prior me and 5 others witnessed the 8 of the same type (u.f.o.) flying and vanishing in the same manner.  I'm sure hundreds in the area witnessed the event as well.;41.5446345679012;-90.5837160493827
