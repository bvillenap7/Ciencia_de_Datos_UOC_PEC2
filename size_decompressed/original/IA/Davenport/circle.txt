I dig enhanced it and determined it to be spherical and pretty far away. All I have is 1 photo, I didn't see it at the time.  I'm going to e-mail you the scan if I can.;41.5446345679012;-90.5837160493827
Silent moving, dark, circular object with reflective bottom moving over houses in Davenport, IA.;2011-05-16 22:15:00;1 min;Silent moving, dark, circular object with reflective bottom moving over houses in Davenport, IA. I had just pulled into work at 10:15pm and was walking around the front of my car.  The moon was full and I was facing West with the moon to my back left slightly.  Something passed in front of the moon completely blocking the light for a second as the shadow passed me.  This caught my attention and I looked up and to my left. When I looked up I saw a craft moving due West and completely silent.  It appeared to be about a block or so away and 150 feet above the treeline.  It was circular on the bottom and seemed to look slightly smaller than a house in size.  There were no lights on it, but the bottom seemed to be highly reflective and appeared to be reflecting a few street lights from below. The bottom surface did not appear to be smooth, as the reflections of light moved on it irregularly. I watched it move slow and silently for about 1 minute before it went behind a building I was close to.   I don't think I would have seen it at all if I had not been in the path of the shadow it cast as it went by.  No sound, no lights, completely dark object except for the reflections.

4 bright white lights moving above Davenport and changing direction in unison;2019-03-16 05:00:00;1-2 minutes;4 bright white lights moving above Davenport and changing direction in unison Three bright white circular objects/lights moving close together from east to southwest. I watched for about 20 seconds, noticed they werenâ€™t moving like jets, airplanes, satellites, meteors...they left no trails and remained bright white.  Then, I saw the 4th bright white light quite a bit behind the others- still in the eastern sky heading the same direction as the other 3. I looked back at the 3 moments before they curved gently toward the northwestern sky.  The 4th continued towards the area where the 3 changed direction.  Pink clouds blocked the remainder of this curious event.;41.5446345679012;-90.5837160493827
