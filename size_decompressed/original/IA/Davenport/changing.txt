Hard to explain but if you can imagine the heat effect on a summer day on a hot street then this is what I saw in the sky at night.  The color of this wave was florescent green.  It looked to be half the distance from horizon to horizon in a straight line.  It moved from east to west.  It was not the shape of a laser but more a see through green heat wave that distorted the clouds as it passed.  It started out very large and ended in the western sky at a small point of light the fizzled out. This is very hard to explain. The more I think about it, might of been a meteor above the clouds but this heat light took 10 seconds to go from horizon to horizon.;41.5446345679012;-90.5837160493827

One of our other friends was on the other part of town and said he seen the same thing.  Later that night we were sitting on his deck and I looked up and we all seen what looked like 1 ufo ship that was going longways length of a plane with circular lights on the bottom and suddenly it started goin sideways and folding into what looked like a triangle and another one came into the picture what looked like they were connecting then went off towards the sky at a high speed at midnight of the 25th;41.5446345679012;-90.5837160493827
