I was 17 at the time and was going to meet my girlfriend. On the way up the gravel road I happened to notice on my left a light in the sky...not unusual really ecept this one was doing some very odd things...Odd enough for me to slow the car down and take a closer look. Another vehicle coming towards me also slowed down and I could see the people in side looking in the same direction as I as they passed...I stopped and they continued on..as the dust settled from the road I got a much better look at this craft. From my vantage point it was simply a VERY bright light light in the southern sky...it was not all that far off the ground and I noticed it suddenly throw an incredibly bright beam straight down to the ground..I thought then it was just perhaps a police helicopter. What told me different was the incredible flashes of color it suddenly began to give off...first a brilliant green fading into green then blue then yellow...not airplane lights...these were bright and faded from one to another and the speed in which they changed varied ...as I watched this thing..it stopped the beam of light it had in the fields below...and then it swiftly moved to the right....then up and then back down forming a triangle type flight path of about perhaps a mile in length...it was no more than a quarter or a half mile from my viewpoint butI figure but who can tell?....I got out of the car and I couldnt hear any sound from the direction of the object at all. As soon as it made the triangle manuver, it suddenly took off at a speed no conventional craft could attain and went straight to the horizon and disapeered. I had a wonderful view to the horizon and I would say it crossed about 20 miles in less than 5 seconds...I sat in my car amazed and completly happy...I had my first encounter with something I believe wasn't of this earth...and buddy, they got the SPEED!!! Im glad I finally got to tell someone off! iial about it..thank you Mr Davenport ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

ET over Rock Island Nuclear Arsenal;2002-08-31 17:45:00;20 seconds;ET over Rock Island Nuclear Arsenal It was Saturday of the labor day weekend of 2002 when I was driving from Des Moines to Chicago. As I neared Davenport, I was about 10 miles west, I noticed a small silver object at about 8000 ft in the air, that was straight North of Davenport. The object was going slow, and then in a burst of speed headed straight South and slowed and stopped somewhere over the Davenport area.  As it slowed, it turned red and had a slight bounce to it. It settled to a stop and continued to glow red.  After several seconds it accelerated and headed back North and within a few seconds it was out of sight, also when it accelerated it turned from red and back into a silver object.  This year, 2004, I again went to Chicago for the labor day weekend. I examined the map of the area that I saw this object over and learned that the Rock Island Arsenal is right directly south of Davenport.  Our so called leaders have assured us that we are in danger of a dirty bomb attack, this could be true, and instead of being made in the Mid-east, it might actually be from the Midwest. I have noticed recently reported  sightings in Kewanee, Atkinson and Prophetstown Illinois. I think that these higher level beings are marking the locations where we might find the people who are working their hardest to bring about a thermonuclear winter as a way of saying thanks to us for giving them our tax money. I have a website that gives a few thoughts about what this ET intervention is all about.  Its the nuclear weapons stupid!  Read More:  ((URL deleted));41.5446345679012;-90.5837160493827
beautiful lights?;2003-07-26 23:00:00;10-15 seconds;beautiful lights? I was talking to my daughter in the kitchen and my husband was standing at the sink getting a drink of water.  He was looking out the window over the sink.  For a moment we got quiet and I noticed my husband was in sort of a gaze.  The next second he said he had just seen a UFO.  I was critical and asked him what exactly he meant by that remark.  He had said he saw a light the size of a softball about hundred feet over the top of the neighbors house, hovering.  He then said it came towards our house in (specifically near our daughters deck which is on the third floor), stopped and then shot up in the sky and disappeared.  I asked him why he didn't say anything at the time and he replied because it was so beautiful he couldn't say anything.  Earlier in the week, we were driving down the street we live on and he said I nearly ran over a deep purple light hovering on the road in front of us.  He said it shot up in the air and dissappeared before I hit it.  I never saw the light.  I asked him why he didn't say anything to me and he said he assumed I saw it in front of us.  I didn't.;41.5446345679012;-90.5837160493827

I was facing west when I noticed a light moving from a westardly direction that was very high in the sky.  If it were not moving, I could have easily mistaken it for a planet.  It followed a slightly arced pattern in the sky, heading in a south east direction.  When it was directly above me I called my wife to come outside and witness what I was seeing.   At first she thought it was an aircraft, then I pointed out how high it was and how fast it was moving. There were no flashing lights.  She then realized that it was unusual.  As we were facing south east, at about the ten o'clock position the object stopped and started to fade.  It appeared like it was going straight up.  It then disappeared.  I've seen meteor showers and this did not look like a meteor.  Right after the incident, we saw a high flying aircraft and realized from that reference that what we had seen was not an aircraft.  We've never seen anything like this.;41.5446345679012;-90.5837160493827
Bright concentrated lights in two bursts, electrical disturbances, magnetic signs.;2010-02-13 03:05:00;Two at 10 sec. each;Bright concentrated lights in two bursts, electrical disturbances, magnetic signs. It was early in the morning and my brother and I were going to sleep after watching a film. As I was laying in bed I looked over at the large picture window across the hall.After a few minutes I saw an amazingly bright light beam shoot through the window, lasting 10 seconds. Even though it was of a light quality I had never before seen, I assumed it was one of my other brothers shining a light in my face. I ignored it and was about to go to sleep when my dad walked up the stairs and asked if we had been messing around with a strobe light.He then thought that maybe a police helicopter or swat team was searching for somebody. It was then we all concurred that we saw something extremely odd. We all walked toward the window and then again, this time only about 5 seconds, and it vanished. We could see nothing else in the sky because the whole sky lighted up, but the beam branched out to concentrate in out attic. We have never seen anything like that before or since. Ever since the occurrence the electricity in our house has been power surging and shorting. The next day me and my brother felt disoriented and unbalanced although we never consume  alcohol.In our car coins were sticking together and the clock was flashing 12:00 as if the car's electrical system turned off.
