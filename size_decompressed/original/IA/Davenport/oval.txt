UFO Sighting in Davenport, by the Sharewood apartments, and the Mississippi Valey Fair.;2006-06-14 23:15:00;15;UFO Sighting in Davenport, by the Sharewood apartments, and the Mississippi Valley Fair. It was around eleven ten P.M. when I looked out the window.I saw four bright lights shining but I though it was a airplane or something else cause I didn't believe in UFO's.I went to get ready for bed and got a drink of water but before I went to bed I looked out the window again through the front.The four lights started to get closer then thats when I started getting a little scared because I realized it wasnt a airplane.It started moving I dont know how fast. I live right behind the fairgrounds so it moved from the fairgrounds (that's where it all happened) it started going above my house. I stopped looking out the window and started walking all around the house and I was either going to wake my mom up but she had to wake up at four or call the cops but that wasnt necessary. I looked through the front window again and it wasnt there. I looked out my back window and the UFO was right above the pond by the Sherwood Forest appartments.I started to gaze in what happened. The UFO got closer to the pond and it started going back the same way it started from. I couldnt look anymore and I was practically shaking so I went in my mom's bed. I kept hearing noises but I still tried to go to sleep.All kinds of things were going through my head. I was thinking should I fight the alien how will the alien get in and if it did jump out the window maybe and go to my neighbors.Then i started thinking if the alien would take me I would want my mom to go with me so I tucked in closer to her.I fell asleep and then the next day i went to my neighbors and asked if they saw a UFO. They said it wasnt no aiplane for sure and they thought it was either a object that was in the sky or a UFO.;41.5446345679012;-90.5837160493827
Oval, hanging vertically above busy intersection in Davenport, IA at mid day.;2012-03-05 11:30:00;5 minutes;Oval, hanging vertically above busy intersection in Davenport, IA at mid day. This was my first experience of this kind and I feel obliged to share. Coming home from paying this month's rent, I noticed something silver and shimmering in the sky.  This object caught the sunlight in an amazing fashion. Off in the distance I strained my eyes to make out what it was.  My friend was driving at the time so I had to point it out to them.  We speculated as to what it could be as we drove closer and closer.  It didn't move unless we broke eye contact, so we eliminated the possibility of a far off jet or plane. It wasn't whirling so we eliminated helicopters.  These are the usual air crafts the run traffic above Davenport.  I leaned forward in the passenger seat still trying to figure out what it could be as we came directly underneath it.  Fourteen to fifteen stories up, an oval shaped object hung there, motionless.  I judged it to be about the size of a four-door vehicle.  I struggled to make out some detail, but it was unusually blurry, as if on purpose.  The blue sky seemed to show through these holes running along the frame of the object.  As we passed below it I hopped over the middle seats and got to the back to try and catch another glimpse, but it was gone.  I could not identify the object, so to me, it was a UFO.  I apologize for not having any evidence of this experience.  My deepest regret was that I had my cellphone in hand and was too busy trying to figure out what it was to take a picture.;41.5446345679012;-90.5837160493827
