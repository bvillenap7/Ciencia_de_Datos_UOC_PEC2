Fireball falling from sky with elongated tail that condensed into ball that fell made a sharp 90 degree turn S.  ((contrail??));2018-11-15 07:00:00;15 minutes;Fire ball falling from sky with elongated tail that condensed into ball that fell and then made a sharp 90 degree turn going south of Cummings, Iowa.  I filmed event and posted to YouTube.  Titled as “UFO in Cumming, Iowa”  Please review video and let me know what you think.  Jets flew by during filming and crossed paths with fireball.  Great for comparison.   After watching the video, I saw smaller orbs flying away from fireball as it continued to fall before stopping and hovering for a bit before flying south.;41.488;-93.7521
