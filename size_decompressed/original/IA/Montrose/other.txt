Bow Tie shaped craft near Montrose, Iowa.;2014-09-12 03:08:00;3-5 minutes;Bow Tie shaped craft near Montrose, Iowa. On the morning of September 12, 2014 we were driving home from work when we topped a hill near the Lee County Sheriff’s Office on Highway 61 South in Iowa and saw very bright lights low in the sky.  Left to right were green, white and red.  All were very bright and looked like a cluster.   We drive this road six mornings a week and have never seen anything like this before.  We proceeded on our way watching the lights, they stayed were they were, and kept getting closer to us.   When we came around a corner between mile marker 13 and 14 we drove under this cluster and looked up to see what we could make out, three green lights, one very bright white light in the center, and three red lights in a bow tie shape.  It was approximately 200–300 feet above the road and appeared to be slightly larger than an average sedan.;40.5165;-91.4274
