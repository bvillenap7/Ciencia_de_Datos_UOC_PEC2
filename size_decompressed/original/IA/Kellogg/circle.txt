I d;1999-11-16 18:00:00;about 30 seconds;My grandma and me were driving home from Newton and About two or three miles outside of Kellogg my grandma seen something go by us. I didnt know what she was talking about. About two minutes after that I seen something in front of us and it was giving off a green color and what looked like to be two big cricles on each side and then in the middle of a little above the big circles there was a smaller green circle. We watched it move across the road and it looked like it was bouncing and then it went into the woods and that was the last we seen of it. It was at night around six o'clock or so and my and my grandma had picked me up from wrestling practice and we were about two or three miles from where we lived and my grandma seen something fly by us but I didnt notice it until about two minutes after she had seen it and it had a green color to it with what looked like three circles, two big ones across from eachother and then one little one in between those two. We watched it as it appeared to bounce over the road and then land in a nearby forest or that was the last place I seen it im not sure if it landed or not.;41.7198;-92.9152
