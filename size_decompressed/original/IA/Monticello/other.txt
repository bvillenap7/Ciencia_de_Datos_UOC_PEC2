Blinking lights moving several different directions.;2007-03-12 23:00:00;3to4 min;Blinking lights moving several different directions. I was out on my deck around 10:00 pm and looked up to the northwest part of the sky. I observed what looked like two white lights close together moving north and the would stop for a feww seconds and then change directions. This happened several times. They blinked out two or three times but would come back on. There was no sound whatsoever. I have to telescopes but did not have them set up. I went into the house to get my binnoculars but they had moved out of sight to the north out of my view. I have observed this same type of thing several times over the years I have lived here.
