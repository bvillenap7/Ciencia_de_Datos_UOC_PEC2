I was sitting in front of our computer here at my house and was watching a movie(Chasing Amy on Starz) that was on a small TV located in front of two windows looking out at our front yard that is facing to the west.  Shortly after checking my email, I was turned to watch the movie when I caught a fast moving light passing through the branches of a tree in our front yard when I first took notice.  Thanks to my astronomy class I took in college, I can say that it was at about 75 degrees in the western sky travelling to the west, northwest and dissapeared at around 45 degrees(with of course 90 degrees being straight above my head).  I live in a small town of 3500 people and not far from our downtown area with pleanty of light polution to boot, more than you would think.  This fireball was five times brighter than any meteor I saw during the meteor showers last night that I viewed from my drive way.  And the color was bright, almost a neon green.  Might I also add, it was an incredible sight and I practically kicked myself when I saw it.  I was in awe and disappointment that no one else was around to see it with me. I am a 20 year old college student majoring in film and media studies with a minor in psych and go to the U of Iowa in Iowa City and am home currently on summer break.  I'm moving back to school over this week.  I'm an amatuer, amatuer astronomer wanna be and heard about this site through Art Bell which I am an avid fan.  Just wanted to do my part and report this.  Please excuse my typos due to it being very late.  Thanks.;42.2342;-91.1986
