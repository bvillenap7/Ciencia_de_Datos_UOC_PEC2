Ashton, Iowa sighting.;2013-10-13 23:30:00;5 minutes;Ashton, Iowa sighting It was about 11:30 and I was driving home from a friends house.  Then I looked overto my right and saw this huge white circle.  It was really bright, and last for a few min.  It was going at a high rate of speed and stopped and then disappeared like nothing happened.  I finally believe my dad that these things are real!
