Orange glowing ball moving slow powerd by jet like flame;2011-07-23 22:10:00;1:00;Orange glowing ball moving slow powerd by jet like flame My girlfriend and I were out on the deck at 10:10 when I spotted this balloon shape that glowed due to a light or jet like flame shooting down.   It was orange with black stripes.  The flame seemed to keep it moving parallel at a slow pace but a lot faster then a hot air balloon.   We watched it as long as we could but the trees got in our way. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.6086;-93.7464
