I had finished watching a TV show and i walked into my bedroom. When I walked into the room there was a blue and yellow light outside. I didnt think much of it since my street is usually full of cars but just as i walked past it to get into bed I saw it. It was much like a tear. Blue lights circled the bottom of it and a yellow one at the top. I stood there in disbelief watching it. It didnt move. It just hovered maybe 5 feet above my yard. I didnt want to look away for fear i might loose it. In what seemed like hours it finally shot straight up into the sky in a streak of blue light. But i knew something had been there because i could see me trees leaves part as it shot in the sky.;41.6086;-93.7464
