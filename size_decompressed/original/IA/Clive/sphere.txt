veering shooting star?;2009-04-06 21:00:00;3 seconds;veering shooting star? Walking my dogs around the block tonight, maybe around 9 pm in Clive, Iowa, I saw something I can only describe as a UFO.   Walking south, I looked up and thought to myself, Oh, a shooting star, I havenâ€™t seen one of those in awhile. Then the object took a strong veer off into a different direction before disappearing.   Can this be explained by modern science?
