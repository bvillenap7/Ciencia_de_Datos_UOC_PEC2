Object re-entering atmosphere...slowly;2006-02-14 08:30:00;1 min;Object re-entering atmosphere...slowly Took my dog outside... Looking straight up I saw what I first thought was a falling star...going south to north.  It was tear shape (tail) and clean like a object re-entering the atmosphere.  Several high altitude aircraft following it.  It flared then stopped.  Flared again...The aircraft then turned west the object then appeared west of my vantage point and duller.  Lost site of the aircraft and object shortly after in cold Iowa sky...;41.6261131578947;-93.7498236842105
