Way too fast to be planes/helicopter, it wasn't going straight up so it wasn't fireworks. It was straight across the sky.  It shot past super super fast, and then almost immediately dispersed into the night.  About 10 minutes later about 4 helicopters showed up around the area. the dog i was walking looked up at the object then went about its business.;41.6261131578947;-93.7498236842105
