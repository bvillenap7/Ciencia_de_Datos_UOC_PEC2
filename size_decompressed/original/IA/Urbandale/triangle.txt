I witnessed a large, golden, triangular-shaped object hovering in the sky.;2004-10-31 19:15:00;:15?;I witnessed a large, golden, triangular-shaped object hovering in the sky. I was driving west when I noticed a large triangular-shaped object in the sky (almost like a fighter plane that was perpendicular to the ground, with the arrow pointing toward the sky). After observing it for a few seconds I noticed that it wasn't moving at all, just hovering. I couldn't tell how far away it was but it seemed very large. It must have been fairly close to the ground because the sky was so cloudy that no stars were visible, but the object was very clear to me. I couldn't make out any distinct lights it just seemed to be glowing. This all occurred in a matter of about ten seconds. I parked my car out of view of the object and ran back to the side of the road to get a better look, which probably took another ten seconds, and when I got there, it was completely gone.;41.6261131578947;-93.7498236842105
Faint boomerang object with no sound, no lights gliding through the sky at a high rate of speed.;2014-10-28 22:00:00;2 minutes;Faint boomerang object with no sound, no lights gliding through the sky at a high rate of speed. It was just about 10 o’clock last night and I was relaxing in our hot tub star gazing. Out of my peripheral vision I thought I saw movement and focused my eyes to that location. It was then that I noticed a faint outline or almost translucent triangle object moving overhead. It was traveling straight south and seemed to glide without making any sound and was moving quickly as it was out of my sight within a minute or two at the most. There were no lights on this object or if there were they weren’t turned on, and it almost seemed to blend in with the night sky. We are located in a newer development so there is still a lot of wild life like duck geese etc. so I first thought maybe it was just a large flock but with no sound as it moved it almost seemed ghostly. I have seen this exact object once before in our old home, once again just outside in the hot tub looking up at the sky, but it was traveling due east at that time. In both instances it was there and ! gone within a minute or so, I wasn’t even sure if I could have snapped a photo if you would have been able to see anything.
