Red Light in Urbandale Iowa July 4th 2000;2000-07-04 21:00:00;1 hour;Red Light in Urbandale Iowa July 4th 2000 I was sitting on my deck watching fireworks in Urbandale, Iowa.  My home was located just south of 86th st and my backyard was against Hickman RD.  I noticed a red light that remained stationary for a long time.  It wasn't a normal light, it was more of a globe and it didn't blink. I didn't notice anything drop out of it like others have reported but I did see it depart straight up and away.  The rate of acceleration was greater than anything I have seen before.  I talked about this event for weeks.  The next day, it was discussed on the radio talk shows locally in Des Moines.
