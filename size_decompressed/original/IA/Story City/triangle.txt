Green triangle craft dropped out the sky and dissappeared.;2002-10-19 00:34:00;5 seconds;Green triangle craft dropped out the sky and dissappeared. I was driving down Interstate 35 about two or three minutes south of the Story City exit, when I looked to the west and saw a bright green craft rapidly moving.  It appeared to be a triangle shaped craft.  It left a blurred-looking trail.  It was low in the sky and large.  It seeminly dissappeared after five seconds.  I saw a similar looking craft last year at about this same time of the year only an hour south of where I saw it tonight.  It seemingly dropped out of the sky and then dissappeared.  It did not fly over the horizon just was there moving fast and then gone.  I am a senior in college and am a military cadet less than a year away from receiving a commission as an officer.  I know military craft and this was nothing acknowledged by any government on Earth.;42.1862;-93.5885
