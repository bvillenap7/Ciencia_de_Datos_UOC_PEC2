Group of 4 red/orange lights, becoming 3 lights then disappearing into darkness of space;2012-03-30 21:15:00;<10 minutes;Group of 4 red/orange lights, becoming 3 lights then disappearing into darkness of space At approximately 9:15pm CST I walked out to my back patio, looked to the sky and was astonished. There was a group of four lights (all red/orange in color) moving quickly towards the Northeast.  I’ve never seen anything quite like this.  The lights were aligned in top-bottom arrangement, where the bottom three lights formed a triangular shape. As they progressed further away, the second light from the bottom faded out and the bottom light seemed to move and take its place, forming three distinct lights in a line (although they seemed independent from one another and moving slightly on their own will).  Then, even more amazingly, the group of lights clearly changed direction towards space!  In a matter of just about a minute, they began their descent and disappeared from the naked eye. I have observed some strange lights in the past but never a group.  I did not have any video equipment to catch this sighting but it leaves no doubt in my mind that there is something unexplained flying in our planet’s skies.  The total duration of this sighting was just less than ten minutes.  I am 30 years old and born and raised in the area.  I work nights and have a lot of experience seeing the night sky in the area.  What I witnessed last night was completely unidentifiable and there is nothing I can compare it to.;42.1862;-93.5885
