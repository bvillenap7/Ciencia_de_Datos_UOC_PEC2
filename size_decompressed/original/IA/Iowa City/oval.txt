Bright silver object low in Summer morning sunlight.;2003-06-30 09:00:00;6 minutes;Bright silver object low in Summer morning sunlight. Looking out across the flat fields of Iowa due East on brilliant blue morning with sunglasses while waiting for a passenger, I saw what I thought to be an Iridium satellite about 15 degrees up.  It grew very bright and silvery for about half a minute and then faded, not moving like the Iridium satellites.  It then came back into view a second time and I noticed an oval shape briefly. It faded again in about 30 seconds but came back a third time a minute later, slightly dimmer. It seemed to have shifted only slightly, laterally, if at all, during the entire event.  The pulsating appearance seems to rule out satellites or a planet. I watched steadily and intently from the first moment it came into view.  The brilliance was intense enough at times to call it an aura. As bright as a full Venus would be at night. ((NUFORC Note:  Iridium satellite flashes do not last for 30 seconds.  They usually last for 3-5 seconds.  PD));41.6499306930692;-91.5249792079206
