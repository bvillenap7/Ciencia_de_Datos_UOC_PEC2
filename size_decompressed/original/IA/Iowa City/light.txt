extremely bright green lights that moved quickly across the sky and down to the horizon;2006-12-12 20:00:00;3-4 seconds;extremely bright green lights that moved quickly across the sky and down to the horizon During the evening hours, I was sitting in our living room while talking with my wife. I was facing her to the south while she was sitting on a sofa in front of a big window in our living room. The curtains for the big bay window were pulled (as we normally do in during the winter months). Then, I suddenly saw what looked like a white/greenish streaking of light that quickly from the sky to the horizon and out of sight. The light moved from the southeast to the southwest. There is an airport near that part of Iowa City, but I have *never* in the past 5 years living in our house witnessed that bright of white/greenish light moving so quickly and then suddenly vanishing at the horizon. Furthermore, I have never seen anything so bright through our dark red curtains. Finally, I did not hear any kind of noise coming from the lights as when it finally disappeared on the horizon I immediately went to the window, pulled back the curtain, and listened for any aircraft noise (i.e., thinking it might have been an airplane landing at the airport). However, I did not hear a sound of something that large landing--it was silent. The event was a bit frightening and I haven't reported this to anyone until now. I can't remember the exact date, but hopefully someone else saw the same thing and will see this description. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));41.6499306930692;-91.5249792079206
Red white and blue strobing far away. I thought I was watching an exploding star.  ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling star?  PD));2014-09-04 21:11:00;1 hour;Red white and blue strobing very far away.  I thought I was watching an exploding star and after about an hour I went to tell my roommate and like 1 minute later while we were both watching it suddenly it moved very fast to the northwest and was mostly orangeish when it started moving and was over the horizon in seconds after being in the same spot for at least an hour.    Mostly white and red with some blue.  It would pulsate and fade the white color and flash the red and blue i think.  It could have been there for longer i saw it first just sittin there looking like an exploding star or somethin but taking off in a straight direction we both immediately knew that was a ufo.  Also i thought i saw a black circle shoot out about 30 mins in;41.6499306930692;-91.5249792079206

It abruptly changed directions and angled up at much greater speed and disappeared.;41.6499306930692;-91.5249792079206
A group of red lights flying across the sky, rising from the horizon one at a time,increasing in altitude and disappearing out of view.;2016-10-02 00:45:00;12 minutes;A group of red lights flying across the sky, rising from the horizon one at a time,increasing in altitude and disappearing out of view. I saw a 2 red lights close together and a third not far behind.  They were moving as a plane would move, about the same speed as a plane would move across the sky, but there were 3 together, and then another came, and another, and another.  They seemed to rise from the horizon in a diagonal line, climbing in altitude until they disappeared.  And they just kept coming from the horizon.  That was what was so striking and unusual about it.   There is a YouTube video from 12/25/2010 that describes EXACTLY the same event that I witnessed in 2016.  There were many more red lights in the 12/25/2013 YouTube video than what I witnessed.  But the event was exactly the same.;41.6499306930692;-91.5249792079206

Above the horizon there were 2 elongated light objects that looked like white light.  They were moving fast and in different directions.  One split off from the others and headed north and disappeared.  The main one hung in the middle of the sky above the horizon.  Then there was another white lighted object above the main light.  It too also he waded north and disappeared.  As I was driving home south the main lighted object sort of just vanished.  I watched it for about 15 min.;41.6499306930692;-91.5249792079206
