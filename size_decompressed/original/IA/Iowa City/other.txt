Two UFO sightings and encounters right by my own house. I think They were interested in me.;2012-12-27 00:00:00;Not Sure;Two UFO sightings and encounters right by my own house.  I think they were interested in me. My best friend and I were just getting back to my house because it was late and my parents asked me to come home.  My friend was right in the middle of a slightly offensive joke when he stopped talking.  I was about to walk past him to put in my garage code.  I looked at him...  He looked like he had seen a ghost.  He touched my shoulder and made me turn around.  Right across the street above my neighbors house was this craft/light.  It appeared to be spinning.  It was red and yellow at first and almost looked like a Venn Diagram.   Meanwhile we were speechless as it appeared to be watching us.  It morphed into one singular circle and was now blue and grey and still spinning. Meanwhile dogs in the neighborhood were having an absolute fit, but we were silent and couldn't move at all.  Then it took off into the sky... basically just disappeared.  It left a trail of yellow behind it.  It also didn't make a sound when it took off. That event changed my life.  Ever since then I have been a believer 100%.  I know there is something out there.  It may be the government..  But I believe it is Alien life. Not a single person has ever believed my story and I just feel like a crazy person most of the time.  So I just don't bring it up anymore. Another even happened in June about 6 months later.  I was having a fire in my backyard with some close friends and out of nowhere a craft appeared above my house and flew away..  But it had a light shining on me and I had a sun burn in the morning.  My friends didn't see this object, but I DID. I would love to meet more people out there who have experienced events like this.;41.6499306930692;-91.5249792079206
