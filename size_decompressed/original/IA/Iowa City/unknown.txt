Glowing figure dividing until 7 were there, at 3 am;2004-04-30 03:00:00;00:07;Glowing figure dividing until 7 were there, at 3 am I was sitting on my back porch with a few friends.  It was a nice night around 3 o'clock when one of my friends pointed out a bright moving object.  At first we thought it was an airplane when all of a sudden it divided in to two. This kept on happening until it reached seven.  Then they all sped upwards and out of sight.  I think this may have something to do with the devil, for there were seven of them at 3:00, satan's hour.  Thank you for your effort.

Late-Afternoon Object Not Depositing a Vapor Trail Unlike Several In-Vicinity Airliner Jets;2008-10-28 17:55:00;1.5 - 2.5 minutes;Late-Afternoon Object Not Depositing a Vapor Trail Unlike Several In-Vicinity Airliner Jets On Tuesday, October 28th, while walking my bike in a large meadow immediately north of I-80 I sighted a single object at about 1755 hours which was traveling westward in a sky with perhaps 35% to 50% broken high-cloud cover.  The air temperature at ground level was between 40 to 49 degrees Fahrenheit. The object was observed for approximately ninety seconds to two minutes thirty seconds. I was about twenty yards east of a fairly-high treeline, but was looking through a gap in the canopy (for at least the final part of the sighting). The object demonstrated the following characteristics:   1) The size of the object appeared similar to that of airliners at high altitude (30,000 ft approx.). 2) The shape of the object seemed to differ from that of airliners however (it seemed lumpish, as a large grain of sand).  This characteristic is what first caught my eye. High-quality IS binoculars were needed to clarify and I didn’t have any. 3) The color of the object was at first darkish, then further along it became highly reflective (due to solar reflection). 4) The altitude of the object was perhaps 25,000 ft to 35,000 ft as during part(s) of the sighting it seemed to be passing through high thinish cirrus-type clouds. 5)  The speed of the object appeared to be similar to airliners at altitude. 6)  The object maintained a straight course. 7)  A striking and much more clearly distinctive (vs. the indistinctive shape) characteristic was the lack of any vapor trail whatsoever. Several airliners in the vicinity [traveling in various directions] were all emitting heavy vapor trails. Finally the object seemed to pass into a thin and narrow cirrus-type cloud and I didn’t see it emerge (It may/must have but I was mildly frustrated by not seeing that).  It was about this time if I remember aright that I noticed two eastbound airliners (one trailing the other by possibly several minutes) approaching the vicinity to the south of the object. I waited a minute or two then continued on. Perhaps the lack of vapor was attributable to a propeller-driven aircraft and/or the altitude being rather lower than estimated(??). To give an inkling of the general location of the object in the sky I sighted it not directly overhead, but angled down 10 to 15 degrees to the south from the zenith, then up 60 to 80 degrees above the western horizon when initially spotted, then 30 degrees or so above the western horizon when visual contact was lost.  Admittedly I’m best-guessing here in retrospect with respect to these aerial measurements. In conclusion the incident was mildly strange.;41.6499306930692;-91.5249792079206
Bright opal colored flash in the sky oround Iowa City, Iowa on Dec. 20th 2008.;2008-12-20 17:00:00;2 seconds;Bright opal colored flash in the sky oround Iowa City, Iowa on Dec. 20th 2008. My wife and I were driving from Minnesota to Georgia via Iowa and were on the interstate (forgot the road number) heading south when the sky lit up totally green for about 2 seconds. Kinda like a lightning strike except it filled the whole sky, then it happened again about 5 seconds later. a bright opal colored flash covering the whole sky for about 1-2 seconds. We would like to know what that was and being there were many motorists on that highway at the same time, was wondering if anybody else had reported it and/or what they thought it was. I don't have a clue and it was just weird.;41.6499306930692;-91.5249792079206
