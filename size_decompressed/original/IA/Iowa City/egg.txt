I watch it closely while driving but could not get my binoculars on it fast enough. I was driving north across Iowa City at 10:30 AM. The sky was clear. I saw a round white object in the north. It seemed small at first but then hovered and seemed larger and a bit like a giant inflated beer can seen in beach commercials, like a cylinder standing up. I headed north on a One Way street trying to keep it in view and it was moving slowly North or a few degrees east of North as it moved away across the Interstate 80 out into the country. About this time I noticed contrails moving to the west from two jets but they seemed different form the hundreds of commercial jets seen daily. They were close together and were very clear for the distance away. I was trying to get home to get my 10 power binoculars. By the time I got to my back yard the object was to far north to be seen even low on the horizen and I chose not to chase it out into the country. It could have been drifting slowly with prevailing winds but I judge its size to be at least 20 feet high from how big it still appeared after almost 10 minutes of viewing as my car moved north. Also the two planes appeared at about the same heading as the location of the white egg shaped object and I even thought for a while they were two UFOs but then I could make out that they were a sort of jet plane, but perhaps they were UFOs, they seemed different than most jets I see and were moving close to each other although they seemed to be of different size and shape.;41.6499306930692;-91.5249792079206
