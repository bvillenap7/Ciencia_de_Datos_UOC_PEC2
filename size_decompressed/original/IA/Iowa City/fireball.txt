11.56 AM 4/14/05 LOCATION:  SE of Iowa City - Iowa City Airport.;2005-04-14 11:56:00;10 sec.;11.56 AM 4/14/05 LOCATION:  SE of Iowa City - Iowa City Airport. Altitude perhaps 1000-1500 feet.  Thin white object rapidly appears and suddently bursts into flames.  Clear blue sky. I lose sight of it for about 10 seconds as I go downhill. What is left is a column of smoke that rapidly dissolves in the light wind. Smoke column appears to be cylindrical.  It starts where I saw the flames first and goes downward a few hundred or thousand feet and then ends. Two passengers see smoke but only I saw the fires. It was like a giant Bic lighter flame.  It was a big fire for the distance away, at least three miles.  Reported to 911 Johnson County Iowa about 12:10. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he sounded serious-minded and credible to us.  We have encouraged him to investigate the event locally, but contacting news media, law enforcement, and taxi dispatchers, in order to find other witnesses.  PD));41.6499306930692;-91.5249792079206
3/18/12 9:30 pm, very fast moving orange small ball, zipped from south to north  - driving west on I80 just before Iowa City;2012-03-18 21:30:00;4-5 seconds;3/18/12 9:30 pm, very fast moving orange small ball, zipped from south to north  - driving west on I80 just before Iowa City My wife and I were traveling Westbound on Interstate 80 on March 18th at approximately 9:30 pm when we saw a small distant fireball quickly cross from the southern sky to the north, very quickly. We were just a few miles from Iowa City on I80 when we both saw this at the same time.  My wife was driving I was in the passenger seat.  It was as small as a star, but more orange in color.  Like as if an orange star was closer, like within the atmosphere, but it was fast, very very fast.  It zipped in a almost straight line from the southern sky to the north.  The whole thing lasted only about 4 - 5 seconds.  Immediately my wife and I exclaimed to one another....&quotdid you see that&quot?  But it was gone very quickly.  It left a very strong impression on both of us.  We both have seen shooting stars and meteor showers...but this was noticiable different.  Orange, small and very very fast. Once again, 4 -5 seconds across the sky from south to north.;41.6499306930692;-91.5249792079206
Hovering fireball north of Iowa City;2012-06-27 23:30:00;~5 min;Hovering fireball north of Iowa City I was leaving the parking lot of Wal-Mart in Iowa City with my girlfriend when I noticed a strange looking bright red/orange fireball in the northern sky. As we were in close proximity to the airport I initially thought it was some sort of airplane or helicopter, however the light was very unlike any aircraft I am familiar with. I had my girlfriend pull the car over to the side of the road and we both witnessed this very strange, bright, shimmering firelight hovering in the northern sky. After a couple of minutes she continued driving east down Highway 6 as I remained fixated on the object through her window (which places the object essentially due north of Iowa City). As we crossed over the Iowa River on Highway 6 the object suddenly faded and vanished into nothing. I have no explanation for what I have seen tonight and I am utterly dumbfounded, so much so that I felt compelled to file this report in hopes that there is some explanation.;41.6499306930692;-91.5249792079206
