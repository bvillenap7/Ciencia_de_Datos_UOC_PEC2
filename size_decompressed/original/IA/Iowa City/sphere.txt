round white ball beyond treetops straight north moving ENE fluctuating;1999-10-24 06:00:00;3 minutes;round white ball beyond treetops straight north moving ENE fluctuating I saw a glowing white sphere appear in the North about 12 degrees up. It moved steadily E like a satellite except it was way too low for a satellite sighting and was as bright as Jupiter and a littel bigger. No other lights present or around it. It curved a little to the Northeast as I watched it for 3 to 5 minutes, gaining in intensity somewhat a few times as it moved away, also similar to a satellite sighting. This was brigher, lower, and moving in an elliptical path, first approaching from the north, then heading east, and then moving away to the northeast of Iowa City. I knew I would not have time to go back to the house to get my binoculars. I was walking just 50 feet from my house when I spotted the object.;41.6499306930692;-91.5249792079206
satellite dots in polar orbit but one grew very bright as it turned into line with first;1999-11-30 05:40:00;30 seconds;satellite dots in polar orbit but one grew very bright as it turned into line with first I was looking straight up in the pre dawn darkness into the clear sky. I see two faint dots of light moving toward the pole star like satellites in polar orbit. One, however, was converging on the other. Near the top of my field of vision, about 5 degrees of arc from the two dots I saw a quick meteoric flash. The second dot then grew very bright, brighter than Venus, which also shown in the sky in the the Southeast, quite a way from both the dots and the meteor.  Right after the quick meteor flash, the second dot turned around the first dot and then they both continued on with the second dot behind the first and back to the faint moving point of light it had been as it converged on the first.;41.6499306930692;-91.5249792079206
Silent, slow moving black sphere flying near Iowa highway;2005-07-15 08:15:00;10 minutes;Silent, slow moving black sphere flying near Iowa highway I was driving to work a few months ago down the highway I-380, southbound, when I noticed a strange-looking aircraft flying back to my right. At first I thought it was a heliocoptor, but as I kept glancing at it, I noticed that it was a perfect black sphere. It was maybe between 500 and 1000 feet away. I'm not sure because I don't know exactly how large it was. I guessed maybe between 3 and 7 feet in diameter. It seemed to fly at a speed only slightly faster than I was driving, so I sped up a little bit to keep side-by-side with it. I couldn't hear any sound but I was in my car and there were several other cars driving around me so I can't say that it was totally silent for certain. After paralleling the thing for about eight miles down the highway, I had to turn into work. I got out of my car and watched it as it slowly flew over the edge of the horizon. It never changed direction or speed, and I had a high vantage point, so I'm sure that it was several miles away down the highway (perhaps 5 miles or more) when it went out of my sight.
