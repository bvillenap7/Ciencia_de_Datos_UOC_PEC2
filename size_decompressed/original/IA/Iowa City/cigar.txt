9 stars in the summer sky,;1976-07-17 21:00:00;70 mins;9 stars in the summer sky, On the way back from picking blackberries, a group of us kids aged 8 to 14 where marvelling over the clear calm summer evening. While walking on a dirt road on the way back to the farm ,(Kelona, Iowa)we noticed a strange pattern in the stars in the north west sky. As we walked we watched these stars and began to notice that they were infact changing formation, as planes might do. As we walked and entered the yard the objects got closer. Enough interest was genarated amoung the group that upon reaching the house we summoned the adults. What I saw outside of the back of the house made me a believer. At about 100 ft I saw a cigar shaped craft, about 100 ft in lenght.A strobing band of lights ran lateral across its underside. No sound,just light patterns. The next sound we heard was a USAF jet that swooped past the barn at low level.30 minutes or so later, observing the southern sky, we saw nine (9) stars moving away ,again changing formation as they went. The local pap! er reported a sighting and confirmed a chase by the USAF. ((NUFORC Note:  We have changed the time above, to reflect an evening sighting.  PD));41.6499306930692;-91.5249792079206
