dark triangle moves slowly and appears to hover in night sky.;1999-03-17 04:30:00;10 minutes;dark triangle moves slowly and appears to hover in night sky. I was driving at 4:30 AM near a cemetary in Iowa City when I saw a bright light in the south, far away. I drove a few blocks and parked across from the mostly dark cemetary. The light grew brighter as I attempted to determine if it was a large jet coming in from the south. Then the light appeared to stop and grow brighter and a heat ripple was visible around the light. I watched closely for any side movement to indicate a plane was coming at me on a direct heading with a landing light on. I saw none. Then the object moved sideways or at a slight angle away from me as the light dimmed after 3 minutes. I could now see small red lights at the tips of a triangle and hear a slight air whooshing sound. No tail assembly was visible. I thought it might be a B-2 bomber but then for a second I could see it was complete triangle with the red lights at the tips and a large stubby silo shaped front ahead of the triangle. The bright white light was now clearly positioned on the bottom middle of the triangle and quite large. The craft then proceeded straight north at about 100 mph. and maybe 600 feet off the ground.  A few years ago I visited the control tower of the C.R. airport and was given a short lesson of a half hour in the radar room and know what the flight paths are. This object did not seem to be on the normal approaches to that airport which is 21 miles away to the northwest.;41.6499306930692;-91.5249792079206
Triangular aircraft with white and red lights.;2011-01-06 19:00:00;10 seconds;Triangular aircraft with white and red lights I am a full-time college student and a nanny.  I was driving home from work when something caught my attention.  I saw a triangular aircraft slowly flying very low to the ground and appeared to be just above the tree line.  The aircraft appeared to be dark in color and triangular shaped.  The aircraft was decorated with a lot of white lights and a few red lights.  I turned the corner and when I looked back I could no longer see the aircraft.  This aircraft was definitely not an airplane or helicopter.  I have never seen anything like this before.;41.6499306930692;-91.5249792079206
Triangular shaped craft on Nov. 8, 2017.  ((anonymous reports));2017-11-08 18:30:00;10 seconds;Triangular shaped craft on Nov. 8, 2017 I had just arrived home from work with my family and I took my infant son into the driveway to look up at the stars.  I saw five lights arranged into a triangular formation moving very slowly above me and my son.  There was no sound at all.  It lasted only about 3-5 seconds, and then it accelerated so fast that the lights formed lines and then it all disappeared.  My son was only one year old at the time, and so I can't count him a witness.  I am over 40 and this was the first time I have ever seen anything like this in my life.  I will never forget it.  I remember that I was not able to see stars through what appeared to be the middle of the craft, but the craft itself was invisible.  It was very dark outside, and the sky was crystal clear.   After a year of reflection, I assume it was a classified govt. craft, but I'll probably never know.;41.6499306930692;-91.5249792079206
