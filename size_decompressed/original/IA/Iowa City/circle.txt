It;1984-07-20 22:00:00;3 min;A slow moving white glowing object moved south to north across the night sky and seemed to be move almost directly overhead of us.  It made no noise and looked like a satellite.  However, about 45 seconds after the object had tracked across the sky two Cobra helicopter gunships that were following the object came into view and continued to track the object until we lost sight of the object and helicopters.

My friend and I had took off one night on Spring Break for a long walk.  On our way back from the walk we took Scott Boulevard (coming from Herbert Hoover Highway) and turned on Court Street.   There is a gas station right on the corner there and after we had passed it a little ways, we noticed something above us and looked up.  It wasn't very far up at all, it was close enough to appear bigger around than our heads (I don't know much about altitudes), and it was totally silent.  All I really remember was looking up at a circle which was just hovering over us, and I saw three round lights in the shape of a wide triangle (they were all closer to the outside than in, leaving the middle black) on the bottom. We, being 13-14 years old (and neither one of us had seen anything like it before) were pretty spooked and didn't stare for more a couple seconds before we started running.  We ran about half a block to a block and then turned around to take a second look (in curiosity, and also to proove to ourselves that we had actually seen what we did).  When we looked back it was no longer hovering in that spot. In the couple seconds it took us to run away, it had flown off and was way up in the sky. It didn't change shape or anything, we saw the side of it which looked like a thin oval (as most of the pictures you see of sightings look like), and could still see the three lights on the bottom spaced out to form a triangle.  We stood there for another minute and watched until it was out of site.;41.6499306930692;-91.5249792079206
