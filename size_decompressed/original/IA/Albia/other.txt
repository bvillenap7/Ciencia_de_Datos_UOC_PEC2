My friend and me were camping in a tent in my backyard around 10 oclock or so. We were laying down and looking at the stars through the air vent at the top of the tent. (The tent has two air vents at the top that you can look through to the stars) we were talking, and we saw what at first we thought was a plane, because it was red. But then it faded to white, then brite blue. But not one big light, it looked like several little lights in the shape of a triangle. We watched it dart across the skyand then hoover for a few minutes. It looked like it was rotating, like now instead of being a trianlge it was round. there were lights that would change from red to white as it spun. After a few minutes of hoovering it shot up even higher into the sky. It hoovered there for awhile, we then went inside to go tell my mom. (she didnt come out side and witness it.) when we returned to the tent it was gone. so we went back into the tent and talked for awhile. I sat up to look to see if it was back, and it was. I just laid back down and paid no more attention to it. So i am not sure how long it was in the sky. But i am checking again tonight to see if it is in the same spot again tonight.;41.0353;-92.7924
