A split second later I noticed the greenish dust moving out of the corner of my left eye. As I looked up through the drivers door window I saw it appear to dissapait. It is 4am and the hair is still standing on the back of my neck. If this was somthing natural please let me know, I bass fish a lot at night and see a lot of falling stars and this wasnt one of them!!!!!;41.8487;-90.67
