White light, moving in different directions/speeds and stopped in the night/morning sky.;2007-08-25 05:45:00;15 Minutes;White light, moving in different directions/speeds and stopped in the night/morning sky. I was driving home from work traveling North-West.  The road is full of curves, so my direction would change a bit, but my house is North-West of my employer.  I got off work at 05:30 AM.  As I was driving home, I noticed 3 lights, that looked just like stars all in a strait line at an angle.  I never saw this before in this part of the sky.  I was trying to look as I was driving, but it was difficult.  I only live 5 minutes from work.  When I arrived home, I went to my back yard and looked for the three stars.  They had moved to a triangle formation, but were in about the same location in the sky.  I did not see them move.  They were very tiny, and looked as if they were small stars.  The light from them was bright white.  Then as I was watching them, just sitting still, to my right was one that was traveling towards the others.  It looked exactly like the other three, except that this one was moving and I didn't whiteness the others moving except that I noticed that they had changed formation from the last time I seen them.  This one continued to move until it was close to the others, then stopped.  I tripped my motion halogen light on the side of my house by accident, and it lit up so bright that it was difficult to see, so I walked further out back.  It was also early in the morning, so the sky had lightened some.  I could still see the lights, but they were not as bright.  Then the one that was moving before, began to move again.  There was no sound.  It was as if it were very far above me.  It would move steady, then shoot at a small angle, then slow back down and move steady, then shoot at a small angle as if it were trying to zig zag, but continued to travel in the same direction that it was when it would slow a bit and travel steady.  In a matter of about 5 minutes, it traveled from my right hand side, all the way to my left hand side to where I couldn't see it anymore as it moved with the curvature of the atmosphere and disappeared.  It had no blinking lights like an airplane, ! but was bright white, like a small star.  I was facing south when I saw the lights.  It traveled from the South-West to the South-East.  The others just stayed in position.  After about another 5 minutes watching them not do anything and turning my head to try and find the one that had moved and disappeared, I went in the house and woke my wife to tell her what had happened.  I then went back outside to see if they were still there, but the sun had come up and it was too light out.  I couldn't see them anymore.  I do not drink, nor do I do any drugs.  I am mentally sane.  I am not into comic books, or a star wars/star trek fan.  I have never seen anything like this before.  I have seen shooting stars before many times, and this was not one of them.;42.4770584415585;-92.3513629870131
Over Waterloo viewed from Dewar and Oelwein;2008-08-31 01:20:00;35 min;Over Waterloo viewed from Dewar and Oelwein I live in Dewar, Ia, and was looking towards Waterloo out my bedroom window and saw a light rising from the horizen to the left of a radio tower approx 20 miles from my house.  At first because of the shape and speed I thought it was the international space station as just 3 days before I watched that go by.  Then this object suddenly stopped and moved back down.  Then up and down and left and right.  I was uing the radio tower as a point of reference so I could tell it was moving up and down and it was even moving left and right to either side of the tower.  My mother was watching the same light from the back yard of her house approx 45 miles FURTHER away than me in Oelwein.  The light moved in straight lines and hovered in place for about 35 min before it begain to get dimmer and then vanished.;42.4770584415585;-92.3513629870131

Bright orange orb quickly passing close by without sound.;2010-10-15 22:30:00;8-10min;Bright orange orb quickly passing close by without sound. Large bright orange glowing orb about 1500ft up.  Fast smooth movement SE to NW. Came from the south over Highway 20 and moved steadily came over close to Byrnes Park   heading toward Waverly. No flashing lights like any aircraft I've seen and NO sound at all! Watched for about 10 min as it passed close by heading NW until it got too far away to see. Orb was like a vapor cloud but bright and almost solid looking with a definite solid dark vertical rectangular area in the center but completely surrounded by the bright orange glow;42.4770584415585;-92.3513629870131
Red light in the sky over Waterloo, IA;2011-07-03 23:40:00;1 minute;Red light in the sky over Waterloo, IA At 20 minutes till midnight just now, my husband, my friend, and I saw a red light in the sky in the northeast really high up, seeming to get higher but come closer to us.  It grew brighter, and faded, then grew brighter again before fading out completely as if it went to high for us to see it, but it seemed like it was going in a very large arch almost. Saw it for about a minute. It wasn't blinking, and very red, but had a white light sorta around it.  Was NOT a firework, nor a plane or anything like that, and lasted far too long to be a firework. Anyone else see this? What could it be? Also, we were near Covenant Hospital. It was high enough, probably the whole town could have seen it if they were looking. It looked like fire, or a missile, sorta. We tried to take a picture but we only had a camera phone and it didn't show up.;42.4770584415585;-92.3513629870131

While looking towards North sky spotted small starlike light moving from west to east.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-04-09 21:20:00;15 minutes;While looking towards North sky spotted small starlike light moving from west to east threw big dipper handle constillation.  First light appeared moving very fast high in atmosphere, then came another light moving in same direction about 6-7 seconds behind staggered a little to the south. Then more appeared staggered '.'.' In this type of formation about 5-8 seconds apart. Turned on flightradar24 app and saw lower flying aircraft on radar but not the lights flying above them. These were not space x satellites. The last 5 lights flying west to east dissappeared into the night sky as if flying out towards outer space and just dissappeared. Objects made no noise. Could hear lower flying aircraft that were appearing on flightradar24 app.;42.4770584415585;-92.3513629870131
