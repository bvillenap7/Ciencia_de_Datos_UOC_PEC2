White Cigar Shaped Craft seen over Waterloo, Iowa;2006-08-05 17:40:00;4.5 minutes;White Cigar Shaped Craft seen over Waterloo, Iowa On August 5th, 2006 I have seen a White Cigar shaped craft in Waterloo, Iowa. It was over the street in front of my sisters House and over houses in the residential area. When I first spotted it…it gave a bright White Light. So bright it almost was blinding as I was sitting in the Hot Tub. My Friend’s Birthday was that day and she was there to also witness it after I pointed it out to her. After 30 seconds or so we seen this Long Rounded at both ends no wings no Tail, no Chemtrail (Smoke) that I could see, and no Wire or antennas plus just real LONG! I didn’t see any writing of any sort. It seemed to be moving slow or just gliding through the air, but at that size and bulk it could have been going much faster.  It seemed to be solid and a bit metallic white. There was also no noise that it made. This Cigar shaped craft was flying really low. It was 70-85 feet in the air just over the tops of the tallest trees The Tallest trees being 45-50 feet tall. It was a sight no one would forget. I watched this craft for 4 and half minutes! Watching it with my friend. It was around 5:40 pm.. There were only a few clouds, and when it reached a cloud as I watched it go behind the cloud, and waiting for it to reappear it just was gone. No it wasn’t a plane or a Blimp, Weather balloon, or swamp gas. Any more information would be wonderful. Thank you.  I have also seen this craft before with my sister but she refuses to get involved. Hope this helps.;42.4770584415585;-92.3513629870131
Bright White/Sliver Cigar Shaped Craft sighted  Iowa;2006-08-05 17:47:00;5-10mins;Bright White/Sliver Cigar Shaped Craft sighted  Iowa This day I remember because it was my birthday, we were out in the hot tub. Was me and a friend. She is the one that spotted it. At first it looked like a pin point of bright light almost like a airplane headlight. We continued watching it until it came into focuse. We both noticed its color, white metallic or sliver metallic color. We both seen that it didnt have fins or wings nothing like an airplane at all. Then we noticed that it was rounded almost pill like, we both then said a cigar! We watched this thing just glide along, no sound at all was present. The back ground was in residential neighborhood. Like stated we were in the hot tub. This object was low enough to give us this detial but not low enough to tell if there were people or windows or writeings. Although to me it seemed almost solid. Also noticed that the object left no trails like a plane.;42.4770584415585;-92.3513629870131
