Very fast, silent, moving craft enveloped by vapor, @ about 8000 feet AGL traveling SW to NW then W;2003-12-28 18:41:00;3 seconds;Very fast, silent, moving craft enveloped by vapor, @ about 8000 feet AGL traveling SW to NW then W Standing on my back porch having a smoke, looked to South East, saw a very fast moving craft, had yellow, green, and red glow enveloped in a shroud of vapor as if it was an aircraft moving very fast. Apperared to be at around, 8000 feet AGL, I had to move very quickly across my back yard, to follow it across the sky traveling South East to Northwest but about halfway across the sky above my house it made a few jerky motions and changed to a more westerly direction and then was out of view. I waited for some sound as it had to be going greater then the speed of sound at that altitude but no sound ever came, it was absolutely silent. About three minutes later I went back outside and a small light piston aircraft at about the same altitude was seen going from South East to North West.

silent objest with rippling effect;2006-11-19 22:00:00;30 seconds;silent objest with rippling effect i was outside about 10 pm and the night was clear.i was looking at orion when i noticed an orange glow to the right. i saw what appeared to be a bat shaped object.that is the closet thing i can compare the shape to. it seemed to be glowing slightly orange on what i would call the main body only. the glow then went away.it was a brownish black color and had no lights or sound. it was very easy to see against the night sky.  it did not leave a trail and was going to the north-northwest.it moved very quickly,and was very high, although not as high as a jet would be. the thing about this that i can't understand is that the wings seemed to ripple. each wing moved at the same time per ripple.it was like from the body a third of the way out the wing, then from there to another third of the way out and again from there to the end of the wing.it moved in a perfectly striaght line and by the time i had turned around as it went over head, it was gone. the size was about half of my closed fist at arms length.i have no idea what it was, but sure wish i knew.;42.4770584415585;-92.3513629870131
Moving lights in the sky seen in different variations.;2013-09-23 01:00:00;2 hours;Moving lights in the sky seen in different variations. On this night I spotted several objects in the sky.  At first they look like regular stars.  These objects are normally really bright white or a yellowish color.  They move in circles and zig-zag motions. Some of the objects move very quickly and others move very slow. Some of the objects seem to have flashing lights.  The flashing lights usually appear in blue, green, and red colors. I have seen the objects move fully across the sky as well. When they move like this, some fast and some slow. They have moved in all directions of the sky. Some are alone and others in pairs. I've even seen four of them in a group moving together. The objects that cross the sky are white in color and resemble a star. Some dim and some bright. I've seen them move across the sky and literally light up really bright for a split second and then keep moving. I have devoted a lot of my time to looking for these objects at night for the past year. My family has even been involved in tryin! g to figure these things out. The most incredible sighting was with my mother in Grundy Center. About 2am, we had seen several moving objects like we have in the past. But, out of nowhere an object appeared. It lit up bright for a split second and then shot flames like a fireball and left a small short trail of what appeared to be fumes. The object went so quick and went directly upward into the sky never to be seen again. That time we both literally ran for the house. We truly believe that these objects are not stars, satellites or any human/man made crafts. All summer we sat outside at night and looked up into the sky. Repeatedly week after week, we witnessed the same objects in a few different variations. We also have several witnesses some family, some friends and co-workers. Even the neighbors.;42.4770584415585;-92.3513629870131
Half disc like shape with a pale green glow that had movement I've never seen before.;2013-11-15 18:00:00;10-15 seconds;half disc like shape with a pale green glow that had movement I've never seen before. I didn't really think about reporting this at first but I decided why not maybe someone else saw it too. I didn't know where to begin with that anyway. I was driving north on highway 218 when I was approaching a stop light.  I noticed a light, which I thought was an airplane, in the sky to the east. It was in the blue, sun-blocking part of the windshield so it just looked like a light. When I hit the stop light I ducked my head for a better view.  I noticed there was a pale green light around whatever it was and it was shaped like a half circle, but not quite.  The end of each side stretched a little further back.  The thing itself was a dark color I couldn't make out anything on it because it was night.  This was also when I noticed the thing wasn't moving.  I turned off the radio and before I could really think the thing took took off heading north east.  It moved like nothing I have ever seen before and I don't really know how to explain it. I just glided off and it didn't even seem like it accelerated.  It was like it was just at full speed but there was no jerking effect.  The green color traced behind it a bit and the thing was gone within a couple seconds. I was looking around at other cars to see if they saw.  I wanted to get out and ask if anyone saw that but the light turned green and I pushed this to the back of my mind basically.  Nothing you can really do about it.;42.4770584415585;-92.3513629870131

I looked up into the sky and saw 15-25 silvery greenish color and were shaped like lines, as if moving without a ship.   We got in the car to follow them and they vanished into thin air.
