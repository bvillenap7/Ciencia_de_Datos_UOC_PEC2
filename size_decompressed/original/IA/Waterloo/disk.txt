Brightest looking star you've ever seen, but moved abnormally fast and moved in zig-zag patterns.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??  PD));2017-09-19 04:58:00;30 minutes;Brightest looking star you've ever seen, but moved abnormally fast and moved in zig-zag patterns At 4:58Am September 13 I woke up from sleep paralyses, only to look outside my second story window to notice a ridiculously bright looking star in the sky, however it was mostly cloudy so almost no other stars were see able.  However, this didn't look As far away then a star.  The white light seemed to be the top of a flying object and underneath said light was an almost invisible saucer shape body of the aircraft.   I watched it for a duration of 30 minutes before it go so far away and this just happened right as the sunrise was coming.  At first the light remained still but appeared to be spinning very slowly with a very large search light beaming out of it diagonally toward the surface.  About every 3 minutes this UFO then proceeded to move and ultimately moving higher and right in the sky but in a zig-zag patter that was ridiculously fast.   I've spent all my brain coming up with anything that would logically make sense here, and I am out of ideas, and completely believe this to be some sort of outer space ship,  There is nothing on earth that can be that bright in the sort of camouflaged state and move at those speeds in such quick angles.   It looked like it was surveying the area, again can't tell exactly how far away this thing was appeared pretty far couldn't get a better look through a 32x scope, it appeared to leave a trail of some sort of chemical every time it did move though but evaporated within about 4 seconds.   Anyway then around 5:30am it was starting to get light out and lost all sight of the flying object. It almost seemed like the plan was to break away before the sun came cause it was damn well timed.;42.4770584415585;-92.3513629870131
