Swift moving metallic orb, traveling East to West.;1989-07-25 20:00:00;seconds;Swift moving metallic orb, traveling East to West. I was watching out my north window watching the sun getting close to setting. The Orb, much like a Christmas tree ornament, was highly reflective reflecting the sky color and cloud texture. It moved very rapidly from right to left and was gone before I could turn my head to track it. The object size was that of a quarter dollar coin held between thumb and finger at arm's length.

On Dec. 29th at 7:09 pm central time, 3 of us saw a large orange sphere coming from the north. There was no noise to the sphere.  It took a very sharp turn to the east (something that a helicopter or plane could not do). It continued east past the tree line then disappeared at a high rate of speed in the sky.;42.4770584415585;-92.3513629870131

Rotated around each each other slowly then disappeared, then re-appeared.   Tried to video tape.  Objects then fell behind tree cover within my city N.E. vantage point.  Originally assumed they were balloons from some event.  Called ALO airport control tower, no other reports at that time.;42.4770584415585;-92.3513629870131
