My girlfriend and I witnessed a bright orange triangular light in the sky.;2013-10-01 22:30:00;1 minute;My girlfriend and I witnessed a bright orange triangular light in the sky. I just stepped out of the house and immediately noticed a bright, orange light in the sky quickly moving east.  I called my girlfriend to come outside so she could see it as well. She came outside and we watched as it seemed to change direction towards us and then stop.  My girlfriend went inside to get a camera.  The bright light stayed there until she got back.  Once she pointed the camera at the light, it began to change colors and then dim.  Eventually, it just became a blinking white light and then disappeared.;42.4770584415585;-92.3513629870131
Triangular aircraft with yellow and red lights.;2013-10-24 22:40:00;1 minutes;Triangular aircraft with yellow and red lights. It was dark so I only seen the lights.  There was a red light on the tip and two yellow lights in the back making a triangular shape.  I was sitting in my back yard, the sky was partly cloudy.  The ufo was slowly heading south and put off a vibrating noise.  It was less than 500 ft above my house.   Right after I seen the ufo, I tried to call and tell someone and my phone kept blinking on and off for two minutes.  Ive never had a problem with my phone before this.;42.4770584415585;-92.3513629870131
