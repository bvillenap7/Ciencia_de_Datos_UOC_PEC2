Flamelike UFO seen in Waterloo, IA;2008-07-18 21:50:00;10 seconds;Flamelike UFO seen in Waterloo, IA Driving home the night of July 18 2008, I caught a glimpse of an object in the sky that I can only describe as flame-like. I was driving in Southwest Waterloo. To be exact, I was heading North on Ansborough Avenue, in between West 4th street and Highway 63, and I looked to my right, where I saw the object hovering high in the sky.  It was somewhat orange and yellow, and it seemed to glow. I cannot discern a particular shape. It did not seem to be traveling in any direction at all rather hovering. It seemed to be very high in the sky, but much lower than an airplane.  I was unable to gaze at the object for a continuous amount of time, as I was driving my car, but I viewed the object in several short gazes. I saw the object, and then returned my eyes to the road. I looked at the object again, and then returned my eyes to the road. I did this again. After the third time I returned my eyes to the road, I looked to the sky again, and the object was gone. I did not see any sort of trail left by the object. The entire experience lasted about ten seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Glowing orange, orb like, fireball;2013-06-17 23:00:00;5 minutes;Glowing orange, orb like, fireball Witness one was just sitting outside.  Ran inside to get me. We both came outside and seen a small bright glowing object. It almost appeared to me to be what looked like a Chinese glowing lantern, however, it then picked up speed and disintegrated. It started out at the top of the tree line, went behind the trees and I was expecting it to come out the other side of the tree line in about the same height level, but when it came out on the other side it was so far away I could hardly see it. If this was a lantern, it wouldn't have floated that far! It slowly just disappeared. I was very scared, shaking, hair on end. We stood in awe, went to turn around, walking back to the house and there was another large flash through the air, quick, so quick we couldn't tell what it was, or if it was the same type of object. As quick as a falling star for this one, frightened me, I grabbed the other witnesses arm and screamed, we both said &quotwhat was that&quot. Just cau! ght our attention, but scared us both and hair on end. So, we clearly seen the one object, after that disappeared and were walking back to the house we seen the bright flash of light, but never seen an object, it was far too fast.;42.4770584415585;-92.3513629870131
