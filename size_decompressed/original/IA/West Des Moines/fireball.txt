Orange burning ball traveling north.  At one time the ball shot eastbound then continued northbound.;2014-07-21 22:54:00;0.45;Orange burning ball traveling north.  At one time the ball shot eastbound then continued northbound. On 07-21-14 around 2254hrs I was patrolling the area of western Polk County.  I am a law enforcement officer.   I observed a burning ball (orange in color).  I observed the object as it was directly above my location.  The object then proceeded northbound, and during this trajectory, the object briefly shot east, then continued northbound until it completely faded away.   As the object was fading away, it would burn low then burn bright.  I did capture the object on my IPhone but the resolution is pretty poor.;41.5765108108108;-93.7807918918919
Orange and yellow blobs went west for thirty min.;2019-05-26 02:00:00;30 minutes;orange and yellow blobs went west for thirty min. Dear NUFORC network  On Saturday May 26th i saw a “fireball UFO” outside my house in the mid west at about 2:00 AM the UFO was orange on the outside and was yellowish on the inside the UFO moved to the west for about thirty minutes until the light got dimmer and dimmer until the light disappeared completely.  I saw the UFO while sitting on my back porch.  It almost felt as if my ears were popping it was very strange.  I have seen this before on may 20th 2017.  This time it was different though it seemed brighter than last time and it seemed closer and since we live close to the airport I had a military jet or helicopter takeoff and fly low to the ground with the spotlight on this happened on the 2017 occasion as well. Please get back to me as soon as possible thank you!;41.5765108108108;-93.7807918918919
