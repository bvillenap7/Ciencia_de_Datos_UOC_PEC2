Ten lights in a strange formation moving east over I235;2011-09-04 23:25:00;Unknown;Ten lights in a strange formation moving east over I235 Was driving east on I-235 heading over the west mix master, a very strange set of lights.  Many lights at first they moved in a line then they split into two groups of three and one group of four, they were moving in an easterly direction.  They were so low to the ground none of us in the car could believe it, luckily I had enough people in the car we got a good description.  We knew they weren’t planes or helicopters because we could not hear them and we would have heard it if it were a plane.  I’m not lying about this, it is not a hoax, this was the first sighting for all four of us in the car.  We are all believers but have never actually seen a UFO tonight we can say we have.;41.5765108108108;-93.7807918918919
10 red orb/lights ranging across the entire northern sky traveling at the same speed and vanishing within 15 seconds.;2013-11-16 20:25:00;1 minute;10 red orb/lights ranging across the entire northern sky traveling at the same speed and vanishing within 15 seconds. At a 30 degree angle in the sky my friend and I saw a formation of about 8 red lights flying at the exact same speed.  These lights made shapes such as a triangle but that was due to them just flying in perfect unison as far as their speed.  They ranged across about 50 percent of the northern sky so the first and the last orb were very far apart.  the first lights started to fade and then after about 10 seconds went away and the rest started to fade as well from front to back.  Then a single red orb appeared from the western sky moving at the same speed and direction as the others.  When it was directly north from us it vanished as well.  A final red orb appeared from the western sky and did the same thing as it's predecessor.  After that the sky was clear.  There are absolutely no clouds around besides directly overhead so it they couldn't have just went behind a cloud to vanish.  My friend with me saw this and said that he saw white lights that vanished as! soon as I pulled my car over.  I did not see these as I was driving the car and was not able to stare at the formation.  I tried to take a pic with my phone but it would not pick up the lights that far away.  This was in West Des Moines in an area with plenty of lighting.  Time was 8:25 PM so it was dark.;41.5765108108108;-93.7807918918919
