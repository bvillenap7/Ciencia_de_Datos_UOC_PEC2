One triangle-shaped airborne vehicle with what appeared to be approx 6 white, round light-bulb lights on the outside of each side with paralell similar lights on the inside of those.  It seemed still for about 15 seconds .My husband and I were driving home from our son's house going west on University Ave.  It was about 1000 - 2000 feet above the ground, approx 1 block west of Barnes and Noble Bookstore.When we tried to turn the car around to get a better look, we lost track of it and did not see it again.   My husband is a professional photographer, but did not have his camera on him and I am his studio manager at his business.We are both artistic:  I also tap dance and I enjoy live jazz music when I can.;41.5765108108108;-93.7807918918919

It was sunset and there was some very interesting mid-altitude shadowing that seemed to have no origin and I was hoping to catch a picture of it, while driving, so I could get a better idea of what was causing it when I got back to the hotel. Overall, I had taken 7 pictures while driving on I-235 between Valley West Drive and 50th where I exited.  Of the 7, 6 show the triangle set of lights.  This was not seen by me personally at the time of the photos.  Nothing else odd needed to report.;41.5765108108108;-93.7807918918919
