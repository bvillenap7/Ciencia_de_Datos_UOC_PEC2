Red Light Hovering over West Des Moines Iowa;2000-07-04 22:00:00;1 hour;Red Light Hovering over West Des Moines Iowa While preparing to watch the July 4th fireworks show, my daughter noticed a glowing red ball in the sky to the north of west des moines iowa. This ball of light hovered for the 1 hour time we were there and was still present when we left. During the observation, which I taped on my camcorder, we noticed that the object moved slightly east then would return to original location. This object was too high to be a beacon or a helicopter hovering. On my film footage it shows a small plane that circles Des Moines every year to watch the fireworks, this plane was well below the object and give a great point of reference as well as nearby buildings as to height, size etc. The local paper has done an article on this but no one knows of the film footage I have except my family. Any suggestions on what this might have been, if anyone else has reported this sighting and what to do with my film footage? Another person here has reported in that article that later, after we left, that another red ball came out from underneath the object and flew away. I cannot verify this. When we left the ojbect was still in sky moving very slowly.;41.5765108108108;-93.7807918918919
2 red/orange spheres moving slowly appeared in des moines iowa.;2011-07-04 20:30:00;3 minutes;2 red/orange spheres moving slowly appeared in des moines iowa. We were attending a fire work show at Racoon River in West Des Moines.  I looked up and seen one glowing circle in the sky.  It was moving to slow to be a plane and was NOT a firework.  A second object appeared to the left of the redish orangish glowing circle about 100 yards or so away.  One of the UFOs disapeared then reappeared a few seconds later.  They were both moving west very slowly.  I tried to take video on my phone but the objects were way to high to pick up an image.  I have read a lot of the sightings posted for 7/4/2011, and they all seem to share the same exact features for what I seen.  This is the very first sighting I have ever seen and am very overwhelmed of the whole sighting and others seen what I saw.;41.5765108108108;-93.7807918918919
