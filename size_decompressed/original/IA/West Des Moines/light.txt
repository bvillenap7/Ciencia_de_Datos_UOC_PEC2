Blue light that look about as bright as Venus streaked across the sky from the south to the north.  I am in apartments sw of the I-235;2005-09-11 21:03:00;3 seconds;Blue light that look about as bright as Venus streaked across the sky from the south to the north.  I am in apartments sw of the I-235 and I-80 interchange. My apartment has a balcony that faces north and I was in my living room.  It could have a been a firework, but I could throw a rock and hit I80 from my apartment as it is right by it, therefore someone would have to be out on the freeway shooting them off. It would have to have been traveling at least 300 miles per hour, but there was no sound. It could have been part of the Air National Guard stationed in Des Moines, but there was no sonic boom and I think they are prohibited from travelling that fast this close to the city.;41.5765108108108;-93.7807918918919
2 Bright Lights in Des Moines Iowa;2010-11-22 19:40:00;a few minutes;2 Bright Lights in Des Moines Iowa I was on my way home when I saw 2 bright lights in the sky that were stationary. The sky was overcast and perfect for cover. As they did not move and were pretty big and no building was at that location I know what I saw was out of the ordinary. Unfortunately I was driving and heading on the on ramp to the highway. I should have turned back and taped them. Then the next day my friend said he had seen 2 bright lights too which moved extremely quickly. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Large ball of light falling to earth at a incrediable speed.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor??  PD));2016-12-13 05:35:00;3 seconds;Large ball of light falling to earth at a incrediable speed. I was driving north on 63rd, when I saw big bright light falling at  an incredible speed.  It only lasted for about 2-3 seconds.  I was waiting for a explosion because I thought it was going to crash, but there was no explosion.   It happened so fast I could not make sense of what was happening.  I don't think it was a plane because of the amazing speed at which the object was moving.  Very very strange and yet very cool. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor from the Geminid shower??

Bright orange light moving slowly overhead.;2017-09-15 19:45:00;30-45 seconds;Bright orange light moving slowly overhead. Walking out of a store, I noticed a very bright light, thought it was a plane as it was coming from the direction of the airport on the south side.  At that time it was very low on the horizon and it was orange moving in a northwest direction.  It was very bright, it didn't seem to be moving too fast and will guess it was a lower altitude than usual for a plane but possibly similar to a helicopters altitude.  Unable to assign a shape to it except it may have had a cross or a + sign in the center of it.  It was bright orange possibly a slightly red orange.  It made no noise and the event lasted 30 or 45 seconds.  It passed directly overhead.  Have had telescopes in the past and many years ago saw an object very high in the night sky with binoculars in northern Minnesota that I couldn't identify,  realized later it was a geo-stationary satellite .;41.5765108108108;-93.7807918918919
