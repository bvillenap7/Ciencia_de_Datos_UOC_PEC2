What we saw was clearly a UFO.  It had flashing lights that were very bright.  The lights would flash on for a second and go off for about 1 and a half to 2 seconds and then back on again.  It had windows, 4 or 5 on the side we could see.  The light seemed to be coming out of the windows.  It was saucer-shaped and had a dome-shaped top.  It came toward us on highway 61 last Thursday night.  Then it seemed to change directions and go the way we were going for a few seconds.  It was about 50 feet above us.   Finally it started flying away from us and it disappeared, so we thought.  Then I seen the light blue lights again in my rear-view mirror, which lasted for about 6 miles.  The lights weren't getting further away from us as we drove on.  By the time we got into the city, it was gone.  I used to think people that believed in aliens and UFO's were insane.  Now people think I'm insane when they hear my story.  I had 4 other people with me too.  Oh well.  We know what we saw and no one's going to tell us any different.

Too quiet to be any kind of airplane, or helicopter.   At first we thought it was a park ranger because we were at Swiss Valley after hours, but it came closer then over our heads super close to us. ((NUFORC Note:  The witness has corrected the date.  The sighting occurred very early on Saturday morning, May 1, 2014.
