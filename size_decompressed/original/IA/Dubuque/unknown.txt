((HOAX??))  All I could think was OH ((deleted))!!;2009-04-24 22:19:00;30-35 Seconds;All I could think was OH ((deleted))!! I saw a single craft illuminated too bright to be a commercial plane, nowhere near an airport.  It started from the ground, and at first it appeared to be on fire, taking off from the ground.  As it drew in, I was lucky enough to get a close look, as it was not very loud-at least not sonic.  It was tilted to my right as it flew above me and looked like an antenna for a cellular tower leading down to a spherical traditional saucer shape, only from the tip of the antenna(lights equipped), there were what appeared to be cables attatched at various points of the saucer, and then from(as though pierced by the antenna) the saucer to the tail end.  As it faded off into the distance, I was sure I had never seen anything like it. ((;42.5042966442953;-90.697398657718

If you ever watched animal planet and seen the deep sea jellyfish glowing in the dark it was like that but shaped like big football.;2014-11-19 22:00:00;2-3 minutes;If you ever watched animal planet and seen the deep sea jellyfish glowing in the dark it was like that but shaped like big football. My mom and i were heading home from picking up my room mate from work around 10pm heading down highway 20 towards Arbys, this whole time im just looking out my window passanger side window facing east to the river, i see a amber redish orange light.  As we get closer i see the shape is like a football or cigar shaped but seemed to be able to see threw it like one of those deep sea jellyfish that are lit up, and had an unusual source of light like a symbol in the middle.   It stayed in place the whole time till we got to the stop light.  I tried to get my mom and roomate to look but mom was worried about driving and roomate dont belive in that stuff but he wont admit to anything.  i have no picture of this which makes me angry cause i so tired of feeling like im crazy and no proof or ppl to back me up. but as i was yelling for them to look the object then slowly moved from east to west to behind us like as if crossing the street. and that was the end of it was about a 2 min to 3 min sighting.  was really hoping someone in the area seen it or got a photo of it.  i kinda wanted to see it again.  one last thing about the time we couldnt hear if it made a noise cause the train was pullin in right next to being really loud that whole area was active that night but i couldnt been the only one to see that.  i really wished i had a camera.
