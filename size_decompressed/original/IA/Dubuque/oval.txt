Beautiful orange lights that moved without any sound;2013-08-16 22:30:00;10 minutes;beautiful orange lights that moved without any sound On Friday 16th 2013 I was riding my bike home from work at 10:30pm on Grandview ave in Dubuque Iowa.  I was traveling north and I saw at least 5 orange lights in the distance.   I thought they were street lights but then they started to come towards me going south.  They made no noise.  I didn't know what to think.  They didn't move very fast and then the first one went into the clouds and disappeared and the rest just vansihed.   I tried to make the objects out but it was hard.  The traffic and bad glasses made it difficult.  So I just thought it had to some nonsense.   I got back on bike and started north again and I looked up and here they came again from the north but this time only 4 orange objects.   The third one speeded up and caught up to the second and the last just lagged behind.   Then they disappeared.;42.5042966442953;-90.697398657718
