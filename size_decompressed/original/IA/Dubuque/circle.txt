Red glowing ball taking off before thunderstorm arrived on location;2009-05-15 17:00:00;5 - 10 seconds;Red glowing ball taking off before thunderstorm arrived on location Myself and a friend were watching a strong thunderstorm approaching from the west before sunset.  We were admiring the lightning activity when we spotted a red glowing ball or circle flying at a 45 degree angle from the tree line.  The ball was the size of a full moon in the sky and appeared to be within miles from our location.  It was jumping around wildly within its trajectory.  Its movement was similar to a lottery ball jumping around in its case during a drawing.  Once the red glowing ball reached the height of a cell phone tower in the horizon line it just disappeared without a trace.  The ufo seemed to be exiting the area before the electric thunderstorm was upon us.;42.5042966442953;-90.697398657718
Round object moving slowly across sky and goes opposite direction in a second.  ((NUFORC Note:  Model airplane??  PD));2014-04-03 20:28:00;2 minutes;Round object moving slowly across sky and goes opposite direction in a second At 8:28 on Thursday night, i was standing on my deck, when i saw some lights coming from the south.  At first I wondered why a plane was flying so low and thought it must be a helicopter because it looked round the closer it got.   Then I realized it was not making any noise and was going very slow maybe 80 mph.  As it got closer I could see the bottom of the object and it was round with 12 lights on the outside edge of it.  There were 6 rows and each row had 2 lights which were whitish in color.   It was heading straight north, stopped for a second and went straight east and up.   The whole thing lasted about 2 minutes and I am still having a hard time believing what i saw.   It's the things that happen to someone else i thought.  I am a bit reluctant to send this but i guess you've heard it all.  It sounds crazy i guess.  But at the same time i know what i saw.  In case you need to know i do not smoke, drink or do any type of illegal drug.   Maybe I should start lol.      Thanks for your time. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the object may have been a model quadcopter, with LED lights affixed.  A worldwide hoax is planned by owners of those radio-controlled craft for about this time in April.  PD));42.5042966442953;-90.697398657718
