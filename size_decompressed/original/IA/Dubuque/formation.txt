Chain formation of objects at very high altitude and speed, changing to cluster formation as they moved.;2009-03-16 21:30:00;10 seconds;Chain formation of objects at very high altitude and speed, changing to cluster formation as they moved. At 20:30 my girlfriend and I went outside to observe an Iridium flare, it showed up right on time and was bright, about magnitude -8. An hour later, I went outside to go to the grocery store. I passed the spot from where we observed the flare, stopped, and looked up. I saw a straight line of about 5-7 dimly lit objects moving through the sky, first appearing at about altitude 30 degrees and azimuth 6 degrees. It appeared to me that the objects did not emit light on their own but were reflecting light from the sun below the horizon. They moved about twice the speed of the satellite we had seen earlier. There seemed to be a bit of haze surrounding the group. They were almost pinpoint sized objects, dim yellow color (which makes me think it was reflected sunlight) and as they approached about azimuth 0 degrees, they changed formation from a straight line to a cluster. The rearmost objects caught up with the foremost objects to make this cluster. As the group continued across the sky, they disappeared at about azimuth 310, which appeared to me that the objects moved into the shadow of the Earth and could no longer be seen. The objects made no sound and seemed to be very high above the Earth and moving at incredible speed. As a background on myself, I am an RN and budding amateur astronomer.;42.5042966442953;-90.697398657718
Formation of 50+ lights in the sky.;2020-09-03 17:08:00;10 mins;Formation of 50+ lights in the sky. On September 3, 2020, we noticed formations of what appeared to be 50+ round shiny objects that illuminated and dimmed randomly in the sky. Some would disappear while others maintained some kind of formation. We didn’t think much of it until we saw the TV series Skinwalker Ranch in which similar things were seen in the sky.  The formation would change shape to a message-like arrangement (as seen in the video), then to clusters and then into a donut-like shape with a clearing in the middle. This phenomenon lasted 10-15 minutes. It would disappear all together and then reappear at different places in the sky not far from the original place they disappeared from.  As the formation was going on in the sky there was also a bright flash of light that appeared for only a split second.  We were watching for several minutes and had witnessed so many unusual things in the sky that we didn’t know what to expect next. Then we saw the unidentified formation of objects form a ball-like cluster and then slowly fly away from us completely horizontal in the sky until they disappeared all together.  We would love to know if these objects can be explained! We can’t understand what we saw!;42.5042966442953;-90.697398657718
