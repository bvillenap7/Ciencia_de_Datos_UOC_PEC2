Fireball shot across the sky with a Northern trajectory.;2014-07-04 22:00:00;1 minute;Fireball shot across the sky with a Northern trajectory. Looked like a comet shooting across the sky.  I've never seen a comet, that's just what I would guess one to look like.  Definitely not a plane or helicopter.  It made no noise.  It just slowly passed over head from south to north.

Orange fiery globes, travelling in the same path;2015-10-18 08:00:00;10 minutes;Orange fiery globes, travelling in the same path Standing outside when an orange glowing ball that appeared to be on fire flew from South to North across the sky.  It did not leave a trail. Once it moved to the northern part of the sky it disappeared. Ten minutes later, another one in the exact same trajectory appeared. Now, a week and a day later, I just witnessed two more.  Although still flying South to North, these two were much closer together and flying in the sky at the same time.  Same flight path, but these two were further to the Western part of our sky.;42.5042966442953;-90.697398657718
