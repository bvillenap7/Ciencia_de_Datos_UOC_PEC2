Following is the result of 3 Iowa MUFON members' investigation of an incident reported to NUFORC on: 4/9/2003 3:04:06 PM 15:04.;2003-04-08 01:36:00;5 seconds;Following is the result of 3 Iowa MUFON members' investigation of an incident reported to NUFORC on: 4/9/2003 3:04:06 PM 15:04.  A daughter and her mother (ages 38 and 58) were driving home to Dubuque, Iowa from a concert in Cedar Rapids, Iowa after midnight on Tuesday April 8, 2003, when a golden-bronze light descended to the right front of their car (the daughter was driving, with the mother in the passenger's seat) and passed through, and perhaps alongside their car.  (Investigator's note:  It is important here to note the weather conditions:  Light snow OVERCAST WITH 1100 FOOT CLOUD BASE 26 Degrees Fahrenheit Wind NE 12 mph.)  As the light passed through the car, both witnesses felt unusual physical sensation.  The driver (daughter) felt a burning, tingling sensation along her right side - and felt as if the light, which was a bit to her right, had affected mainly that part of her body, and stated that her insides felt as if they were being pulled to the right as the light passed through.  The mother also felt physical sensation which, because of the medication, Oxycodone, which she'd taken an hour before the incident for a condition called neurofibromatosis, she thinks she should not have been able to feel.  The mother saw the light first as it began descending toward the car, with the daughter then able to perceive it as it appeared in front of the car and moved through (and perhaps along the right side) of the car.  (Keeping in mind the 1100 foot cloud base, we at least know that the light would have been below 1100 feet when the mother first saw it descending.)  To the witnesses, the duration of the sighting and passage of the light seemed like no more than perhaps 5 seconds.  The daughter/driver remembers her head whipping to her right briefly as the light passed through.  The next thing she knew she was staring straight ahead at the road with her hands tightly gripping the steering wheel, with the words, Focus-focus-focus-focus-focus going through her mind as the car moved along at 55 miles per hour.  She immediately looked at the car clock and saw that it was 1:36 a.m., although neither witness is aware of the ti! me when the incident began, and so the question of the length of the incident goes unanswered.  At no time did the witnesses see a craft, but both of them perceived some kind of energy they find it difficult to describe.  The mother sketches a series of horizontal and vertical marks within the light, and the daughter mentions a kind of swirling, fluid black mist in the light.  Oddly, it was later found that a gold T-shirt purchased at the concert, which had been inside the mother's bag in the front seat prior to the incident, was now, following the incident, on the floor in the back seat.  Physical effects on the daughter/driver continued to manifest, i.e.: for 3 days her husband noticed the hair on her right arm would stand up, with the hair on her left arm lying down normally.  She also had the sensation of heat on the right side of her body, at the same time she felt normal temperature on the left side of her body.  When the daughter related the incident to a friend from out of state, her friend advised her to check her body for marks, and she and her husband noted a puncture mark about an inch below her navel.   Whether this is related to the incident, of course, is not definitely known, but the witness says she doesn't know how it got there.  About 10 days after the incident, the daughter/driver's lymph nodes began to swell (Whether this is at all related to the incident is not known it is simply something to take note of).  The daughter/driver witness has now been to the doctor several times, with blood tests being taken, and nothing found amiss.  The swelling persisted at high level for about 6 weeks, then began to decrease somewhat, although there is at this writing (June 29, 2003) still some swelling of the nodes.  After the light had disappeared, mother and daughter say that there remained a golden glow on the clouds as they made their way on the rural highway toward Dubuque, Iowa.  When they came to the Dubuque airport some 25 miles further on down the highway, they noted that the airport lights could not have been the golden light they'd seen because the airport lights were definitely white instead of gold.  Iowa MUFON personnel continue to maintain frequent telephone contact with the daughter witness as she continues to have her health assessed by doctors in her area. ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Iowa MUFON State Director, Beverly Trout, for requesting the case for follow-up, and for submitting the report to NUFORC.

Two Orange Spheres moments apart, followed by smaller moving star like object, which became two lights moving together from another dir;2010-08-08 21:00:00;felt like 10 mins but tim;Two Orange Spheres moments apart, followed by smaller moving star like object, which became two lights moving together from another dir Went outside to see if air had gotten cooler.  Felt good, was standing outside when noticed a low flying, largish bright orange sphere in horizon.  Kept staring at it as it looked so wrong.  I was waiting for the light to blink like a plane.   But this never happened.  It continued to move slowly,  then gradually seemed to shrink and disappear. Moments later there was another of the same sort. This one did not disappear, just gradually went out of sight?(trees and horizon)  This was followed by yet ANOTHER oddity though from a different direction. Looked like one of those small moving stars.  Only as it got overhead another light came on directly on the side of it.  Like two tiny ones moving together, or lights on the same object?   Again the lights did not blink like a plane.   Was flying low and silent in the horizon.     Thought I saw the outline of metal around the lights  but I am not sure. Very strange!;42.5042966442953;-90.697398657718
Bright BRIGHT BIG white light w/ 2 smaller lights blinking red and orange;2011-06-06 22:00:00;2 minutes;Bright BRIGHT BIG white light w/ 2 smaller lights blinking red and orange I was driving home with my mom, today June 6th, 2011, from Epworth, IA, and as we are driving home towards Dubuque, I look out the passenger window, and I see a Bright white light. with two smaller lights in the corners that were blinking red and orange.   Right then I knew it could not be a light tower, a helicopter, plane, or anything along those lines. It was WAYY to bright to be anything normal. so it has to be something abnormal or extra terrestrial.  But it was there for approximately 2-3 minutes.  And the strange part was, it just hovered there. then slowly went down.  Then came back up.  And then just disappeared.   I cant be exactly sure that, that's what it was, but I have the strongest feeling that was no plane.  But my mom saw it to and she didn't know either. we pulled over so i could try to get a picture before it disappeared, but when i went to take it, it just vanished,   (Please anyone, do you know what it is? or have you seen anything like it?);42.5042966442953;-90.697398657718
Single bright, moving winking light and â€¦  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible tumbling rocket/booster??  PD));2011-07-30 21:10:00;about 10 mins?;Single bright, moving winking light and ... It was a little after 9 PM tonight when i saw this stuff.  I'm not sure these are U.F.O but were not anything I have seen before. The first object was a single white winking light. moving semi fast across the sky.  As far as I know planes have at least two lights.   This was a single large bright light that winked off and on every 2 seconds(estimate) as it moved.  The sky was perfectly clear.  No clouds.  There was no sound with this object. Following this in another direction were two moving stars(fainter) spaced apart lined up exactly to each other side by side.  One was brighter than the other.   I am aware that moving stars are said to be satellites, but I have never seen two traveling together like that.  It also made it weird that i saw these moments after the other light.

Large craft moving then ceasing along w/ some sort of lighted craft that entered the view of the 'star' lit like craft.;2015-07-13 23:00:00;15 minutes;large craft moving then ceasing along w/ some sort of lighted craft that entered the view of the 'star' lit like craft and rersembled a Neighbor and I witnessed a light, roughly the 'size' of a star, moving from the Southeast to the Northwest.  We watched this 'light' move and stop...move and stop in the same direction-to the Northeast, until suddenly a light..resembling an old videogame-dash, dash...so on and so forth, shot into view-again to the Southwestern sky and as it left a laser like light trailing very fast, the 'star light' and the meteoric like 'incoming' whatever....both disappeared.   This is a hot zone for these types of events Peter, ergo I will do my best from now on to eilm or photograph these anomolous 'activities' as best I can.  hope this was helpful in some way as this area is truly a 'hotspot' for craft unusual and unidentified sky events.     Keep up the good work Peter.  Many people are very grateful and proud of your endeavour to log these bizarre craft and their activities.  Yours, ((name deleted));42.5042966442953;-90.697398657718

An extraordinary fast moving bright white light travelling west that appeared as it could be the light on a plane, but it wasn't blinking.   Travelling horizontally low to the ground, not much above the traffic lights, too fast to be a jet.   As quickly as I called my companions attention to it, it blinked 3 times and vanished.   Brilliantly clear night sky with full moon.;42.5042966442953;-90.697398657718
