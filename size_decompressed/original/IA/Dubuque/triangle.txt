Lights hovering next to Dubuque bridge.;2013-08-13 23:00:00;10 seconds;Lights hovering next to Dubuque bridge. Was driving across Dubuque, WI bridge into WI about 11 pm.  I looked to the north and observed 3 stationary red lights adjacent to the bridge.  As it was a rainy, hazy night I thought they were the lights atop two radio towers in WI.  By the time I realized that the towers were too far away for it to be them, I was across the bridge and well into WI.  I guess I should have turned around and investigated but I had a long journey ahead.   Only thing I can think is it was a UFO next to the bridge.;42.5042966442953;-90.697398657718

Standing, facing due East from the front of the house we noticed a GIANT triangular craft floating silently above the house moving West to East.  I live on the top of a bluff overlooking the Mississippi Valley and we have seen many and varied types of craft.   This craft was floating maybe 1000 yards or so above the area.   please see accompanying video Peter...i hope it's of a quafile:///C:/Users/Owner/AppData/Local/Temp/video-1470097628.mp4lity U can use and archive.

Dubuque, Ia.-Constant bright white lighted stationary triangle?shaped object in the western sky every night in Feb 2017 approx fr 6-8pm;2017-02-26 18:00:00;Nightly-2 hours;Dubuque, Ia.-Constant bright white lighted stationary triangle?shaped object in the western sky every night in Feb 2017 approx fr 6-8pm Every evening this month for 2 hours approx. 6-8pm a stationary bright white lighted triangle?  shaped object hangs in the western sky in about the same place. Lights not twinkling or flashing ever.  When it leaves it's like it backs away deeper into the west because you don't see any movement except that it gets smaller and then it is gone in the dark sky.  May have an antenna of sorts (On object or possibly a tail if you will?) that is not constantly visible perhaps with the cloud cover.  Noticed and have watched this every night in February-may have been there before.(?)  Sometimes, it is there a little earlier and leaves a little later.  Pretty well sits in the same place.  Never have seen it when it arrives to possibly see movement or details about it.  Very interesting-wish I would see it from the start!  Or even much closer!  I would very much like to know what it is!  Please E-mail a response to my E-mail below.  I really would like to know your perception/knowledge of this!  Thank You!;42.5042966442953;-90.697398657718
