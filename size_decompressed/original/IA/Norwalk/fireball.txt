(we were driving into norwalk, eastbound on highway G14,  just a few miles from the Des Moines airport.)  i said i don't know, but it has a tail.  it was a large and very bright blue-green object that arced through the sky and then appeared to vanish just before we would have lost sight of it behind buildings and trees.  it was visible to us for 6 to 8 seconds.  we could not tell how high up it was but it seemed to be relatively  low to the ground  ...about where a helicopter would fly or maybe a plane on approach to the airport.     my son made a wish on it and when i said i was going to contact the UFO Reporting Center about it he cautioned me not to reveal what he wished because it won't come true!! My husband (a 46-yr-old postal worker), myself (a 41-yr-old postal worker) and our five-year-old son were driving eastbound on hwy G14 in Warren County.  My husband spotted the object.  It was arcing through the sky from south to northeast.  It was a large, bright blue-green fireball-type object.  The time on the clock in my Jeep said 6:04pm (central).  The object was visible for 6 to 8 seconds.;41.4868;-93.6538
