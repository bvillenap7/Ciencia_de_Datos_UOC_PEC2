I also saw some white lights in the sky over my barn. The lights were around the cigar object and I went to check inside my barn. I came out of my barn and still saw it and it disappeard and I saw it no more. This was on November 22, 2005 on a Tuesday night at 7:40 P.M. I didn't see the cigar object or the white lights no more. It was very cloudy and started to storm after that. Then there was lightning and thunder and heavy rain in the area. So I got in my car and drove back into town.;41.4868;-93.6538
