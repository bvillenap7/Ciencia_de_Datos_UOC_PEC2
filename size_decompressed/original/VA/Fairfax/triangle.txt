There appeared to be a beam of light between 2 of the white lights. I was sitting outside Fair Oaks Hospital and saw the following in the sky.  There were 2 very distinct white lights and one other less distinct white light that formed a triangle shape.  Counting the lights clockwise, with number one being the top:  !: bright white 2: dim white light (barely visable) 3: bright white.  Between number 2 and 3, there was a small flashing red light.  At first I thought it was an airplane because there are many aircraft in the area.  However there was a stream of light between lights number 1 and 2 and a stream of light between lights number 1 and 3.  In other words, there was no line for the bottom of the triangle.  These streams of light I refer to, did not appear solid, but appeared as directed radiance between the other lights.  It moved at the average speed that one witnesses in aircraft when near an airport.  This is my second reporting of a sighting.  I am very skeptical in regards to UFOs, but I cannot explain what I saw, especially the one I reported seeing in December.  I expect this one was an earth-bound aircraft, but the one in December....well...I will never forget it nor the effect it has had on me.;38.8516344594595;-77.3123695945947
Triangular object gliding through the night sky.;2013-03-09 08:00:00;5 minutes;Triangular object gliding through the night sky. Triangular object,Looked like it was just gliding through the night no sound. We could see the front of the object but nothing from the back.  It did not leave any trail like a normal plane would.  It looked like a haze in front of object??  Was heading in the direction of Dulles international airport they might have picked something up.  Was not moving fast and looked very big in size.

The appearance of the UFOs were that they had three white lights and an occasional flash of red light.  One was about 1,700 feet in the air and moved quite a bit.  The other was about 2,200 feet away and didn't move around at first or hardly at all.  I observed beams of light coming from the closer UFO.  The UFO at about 1,700 feet would pickup speed, slow down, hover around the area and zig-zag in very unusual patterns and at time rotate in very weird angles that aren't possible by a traditional aircraft.  At some points, I could hear the UFO and what sounded like a traditional aircraft. I took a few pictures with my cellphone camera, none which came out clearly.  It was if the closer UFO was able to see the flash of light from my camera and started flying in even more unusual patterns for a few seconds. This is my 2nd UFO appearance in a week.;38.8516344594595;-77.3123695945947
