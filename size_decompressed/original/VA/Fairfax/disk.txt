Circular object one red, one orange, one white light;1988-07-20 22:00:00;3-4 minutes;Circular object one red, one orange, one white light I had a strange urge to look out my window before going to sleep. As i got to the window I looked out above the houses across the street from me and noticed a strange object moving very slowly across the sky. It was circular or disk shaped and did not rotate or anythinglike that. There were three lights on the bottom of the craft one was orange one yellow and one red basically froming a triangle on the bottom. My window was wide open and it made no sound whatsoever. It slowly moved up and overhead and then i noticed something strange because at first I thought it might just be a helicopter. But it started shining a light up and into the clouds creating a circluar yellow white light above it in the clouds. I have thought about this alot since then and am pretty sure helicopters shine their lights down not up into the sky. As the craft passed over the top of my house I ran down stairs to tell my parents what i was seeing, but theycould have cared less. I then ran bck upstairs and into one of the rooms on the back of the house and could still see the craft moving overhead still making no sound and stiil shining the light up into the clouds.  After another minute it flew out of my view. I still don't know what i saw. I know it was not a plane or helicopter, but totally unlike anything i had seen before or since.

It couldn't have been more than a couple of thousand feet away. There was no noise and it stayed hovering for a moment after zig-zagging back and forth, and just like a rocket, disapeared in the clouds. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is anonymous.
