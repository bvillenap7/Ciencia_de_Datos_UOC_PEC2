Red/white lights on rotating box hovering, changed to green/blue lights as well when comes close and then flys away at surprising speed;2009-12-24 01:00:00;5 minutes;Red/white lights on rotating box hovering, changed to green/blue lights as well when comes close and then flys away at surprising speed Last night, as I tried to fall asleep in my sunroom I saw wat I thought to be a plane in front of me in the sky till I realized it was moving exceptionally slow.  This box made an odd path around my house with white/red rotating lights.  After a couple minutes it went from appearing very far away to HOVERING RIGHT ABOVE MY NEIGHBORS TREELINE (where I initially thought it was some sort of weather balloon but there was NO visible balloon over the box) where I got an exceptional view and I now regret not searching for my camera.  The lights now included green an blue and rotated slowing just hovering not too distantly away.  Next thing I knew the lights were flashing or blinking? and the object was suddenly far away and high and the sky where I could only make out red/white lights again. Please let me know if anyone else has seen this on that night in Fairfax Virginia cause it was for sure not Santa!;38.8516344594595;-77.3123695945947
Fast moving two humped camel back light source;2010-03-06 20:45:00;2 seconds;Fast moving two humped camel back light source At approximately 8:45 pm on 3-6-2010 I was on my second story deck in Fairfax, VA observing Orion.  It was a perfectly clear evening sky.  Low on the horizon I saw two planes due west crossing one anothers flight paths preparing to land. From slightly below and to the right of Sirius, I saw an unbroken arc of dull white light shaped like a two humped camel's back move on a 45 degree angle toward earth's surface.  This entire event took place in approximately two seconds. It reminded me of search lights at a store grand opening that bounce off clouds, except there were no clouds.  This did not appear to be the outline of any type of craft, rather the leading edge of an incredibly large fast moving light source.;38.8516344594595;-77.3123695945947
