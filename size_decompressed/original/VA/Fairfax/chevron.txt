The V's legs were at a 45 degree angle.  It was about 10-15,000 feet and was burnt orange in color with possibly globular lights on its perimeter.  As it moved I could see stars between the objects legs.   It moved in an effortless, and noiseless manner and after about 10 seconds faded and disappeared before our eyes.  The conditions were clear, and cool, with some light refraction from the city.  I have a position of trust with the government and am a true skeptic.  But I and my son saw this and it was no flight of birds, swampgas, helos, or any other aircraft.  About 20 minutes later I heard aircraft possibly on afterburners moving at high altitude in the same general direction as this craft.;38.8516344594595;-77.3123695945947
Chevron.  No lights or sound. flew over head calmly fast. night time. 40ft @ 400ft above.;2014-04-27 23:00:00;1 minute;Chevron. No lights or sound. flew over head calmly fast. night time. 40ft @ 400ft above I went out for a smoke and was looking in the sky S.E. of my house.  Noticed a silverish/white line coming towards me.  I called for my wife and followed the object as it flew overhead.  It was fast but not like blinding fast.  flew overhead it was chevron, metallic and it looked as if I could grab it but it was above the clouds.  No sound no lights and the breeze was clam. I would say object was 40ft wide at about 400ft above me.  as I turned around to my wife it disappeared.  I have lived by airports, been in the military and I have never seen anything like this.;38.8516344594595;-77.3123695945947
