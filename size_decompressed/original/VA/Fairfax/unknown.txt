I was watching the stars as it was a very clear night at that time. I was looking at the moon which was about three fourths full, and also seeing some aircraft in the distance. I believe i was facing south east or east looking at the stars just below the moon when an object went from my right to the left, at level flight, no noise whatsoever, no lights of any kind traveling  above the speed of sound at a very low altitude ( a few hundred feet) above the trees in a residential area. I believe the ONLY reason I saw it, was because the moon was almost full and the object passed brtween me and the moon, the angle of the moon caused a reflection to shine off of the skin of the object. Same reflection as polished metal. The object left no trail to be seen (such as a shooting star) I've seen shooting stars and all types of aircraft and this WAS NOT either one of them.;38.8516344594595;-77.3123695945947
Four flashing white lights;2007-08-15 00:44:00;2 minutes;Four flashing white lights I was in my bed on the second floor the house reading at the time. At 12:44 am on Wednesday, I head a loud noise that seemed to be overhead of my house. At first I thought nothing of this sound since I thought it might have been an airplane that low but that changed when I heard what appeared to be the engine sound vanished. I assumed that the plane had left but then I heard it the sound again so I rush to my bed to see what is going on.  	So I open the blind on my window to look outside to see what is going on. In the distance not that high up in the horizon slightly above the trees in my neighborhood were four round flashing white lights that were stationary objects at the time. They were flashing every second at the same time. There are no towers in this area I was looking at so I assumed it was some type of aircraft in the air not moving. But then one of the flashing lights on the west side started to move alarming fast toward the west. Did a quick reverse like slamming on the brakes. Then shot out of my line of sight. The other objects remained still.  	Then the other three objects began moving. These three objects were in the formation of a triangle and by moving increased the size of the triangle but seemed to keep the same angel on the shape. Then the objects left the area, it appeared as though they had turned off the lights. With this all of a sudden the sound I had heard had vanished.;38.8516344594595;-77.3123695945947
Thwomping/humming reverberations as well as dark shroud;2019-08-13 00:40:00;~3 minutes;Thwomping/humming reverberations as well as dark shroud I had been sitting by my firepit since 9pm, feeding the fire and thinking about life.  I live near a hospital and not too far from the airports and constantly hear/see conventional aircraft of all sorts.  At about 12:40 a.m., this overwhelming energy and humming/thwomping reverberation lowered over my house as well as a dark shroud/cloud. I had never felt anything like it.  The interaction lasted maybe 3 minutes and then I felt and saw the energy dissipate.  Didn't feel scared or threatened, if anything I felt connection and understanding.  After the event I heard the most bizarre owl call that was unexplainable, like nothing I've heard before.;38.8516344594595;-77.3123695945947
