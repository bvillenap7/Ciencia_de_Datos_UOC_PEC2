((NUFORC Note:  Possibly advertising lights.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM Joan Woodward, noted UFO investigator from Fairfax, VA, area)) Hi Peter, Just noticed this sighting, about which you suggest an advertising display  as a possible cause.  There was a quad-search light display in the Tysons  Corner area (NW part of the Capital beltway) in February. Driving the  beltway at night, it was eye catching and visible for a considerable  distance.  I wondered if you would get any UFO reports from it.

Flashing red light in night sky for several hours.;2013-02-12 19:30:00;5 hours;flashing red light in night sky for several hours At about 6:30 pm a flashing red light appeared in the sky.  It stayed in the same area for about 5 hours, emitting no audiable sound.  Sometimes it moved slightly from one place to another, but never left the general spot in the sky.  Sometimes it flashed from blue to red, then from dim red to bright red. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Extremely bright light.;2014-03-23 21:00:00;6 seconds;Extremely bright light. While driving east on 495 close to little River Turnpike, I noticed an oblong shape 100’,long light.  The color was white and it was extremely bright.  The light was a half mile away and it hovered at about 500’ to my left.  The light did not move at all.  Everyone in the vehicle saw it.  My dash camera was not on so I plugged it in and looked again and it was gone.   The light was very strange.  Even though it was extremely bright it did not illuminate any of the trees under it.   I have been on Army, Navy, Marine, Coast Guard, and Air Force bases, and I have never seen anything like it.;38.8516344594595;-77.3123695945947

Within 5 seconds it looked like it was moving upward until the light was not visible anymore.  There seemed to be a small trail left behind, almost like a rocket launch or missile.

Impossible movement for a plane or balloon;2020-06-13 10:15:00;10 minutes;Impossible movement for a plane or balloon A single point of reflective light moved across the sky. At first blush appeared to be a plane. But, was too small, was too high in the sky, and moved erratically, at some points moving forward rapidly, then coming to a full stop, then moving forward slowly, then stopping again, then rapidly. After it stopped the last time, it sat for a minute, and then, for lack of a better term, “blinked”, and then shot off at an incredible speed, seemingly further up into the atmosphere until it could no longer be seen;38.8516344594595;-77.3123695945947
