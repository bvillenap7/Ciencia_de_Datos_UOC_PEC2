Was looking out open window and a white light lit up the entire area for a second or two. Not a sound, the moon is full and  bright.  Felt pressure in my ears and it was gone.   I looked up in the sky and saw nothing, I was looking to the back yard not up, when it happened.   Very curious as to what this was.  Cameras active in the area have got to have picked it up.
