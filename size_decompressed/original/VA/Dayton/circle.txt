I was approximately  7 years old at the time, but I remember as vividly as if it were today. I was  looking out my bedroom window, which had a large field across the road.  Directly outside of my window (within a foot of my eyesight), I saw a yellow round circle roughly the size of a baseball.  It was spinning/bouncing  around in circles, made no noise, and did not seem to be bothered by me watching it.  I had no fear, and remained calm.    After about 3 or 4 minutes of my watching/observing, it took off into the field across the street from my house (100 ft) and continued the erratic movement from left to right, up and down, and then it rapidly darted into the sky and disappeared within a split second!  And I did not see it anymore after that.  Craziest thing is ever experienced.;38.4707;-79.085
