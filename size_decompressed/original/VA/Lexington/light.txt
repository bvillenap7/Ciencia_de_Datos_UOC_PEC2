I can't remember the exact date that this occurred but I was with a group of friends on top of a mountain just outside of Lexington Virginia.  We were on North Mountain which about a 15min. drive from Goshen Pass.  Most of my friends had their back turned and didn't see what I saw but one friend saw it out of the corner of his eye and yelled what was that.  What I saw was a bright light in the sky.  It a round ball of light.  It was about a hundred yards away hovering over the trees on top of the mountain.  It didn't make a sound.  My friend saw it when it zipped really really fast down the mountainside in a zig zag motion and faded out of sight.  I was compeltely sober.  I am a skeptical person by nature but I know what I saw.  It could be a human made aircraft that the government is not talking about but it definately was not a plane or helicopter. I may have written it off as a halucination if my friend had not seed it too. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));37.7915026315789;-79.4531263157896
