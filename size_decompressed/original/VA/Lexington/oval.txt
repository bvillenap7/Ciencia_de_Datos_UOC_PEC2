Strange  but very beautiful;2021-06-25 05:30:00;5 minutes;Strange  but very beautiful The object was moving west to east. At the speed of a prop plane.   bright reflection from an oval object.  No navigation lights, no wings, no noise, no contrail., seemed to be metallic.  Difficult to say elevation but above 20,000 ft   At first I thought it was Sky Lab but checking it was the wrong time of day for the space station.  The object seemed large, longer than it was wide and it moved in a straight line .. no deviation of path.  It was beautiful but strange.  Perhaps another satellite but it was interesting.  No other planes in area at this time but flight path not typically used by commercial or military aircraft.;37.7915026315789;-79.4531263157896
