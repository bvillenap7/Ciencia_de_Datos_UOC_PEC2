White light witnessed from aircraft is seen traveling at an extremely high speed;2008-07-27 22:10:00;2-3 Seconds;White light witnessed from aircraft is seen traveling at an extremely high speed This sighting occurred on Sunday, July 27th 2008 at 10:39PM EST. The object was witnessed aboard a McDonnell Douglass MD-82 twin jet aircraft traveling eastbound at 33,000 feet and 497 knots. At the time of the sighting the aircraft was at latitude 37.87 and longitude -79.79, placing the aircraft between Covington and Lexington, VA. The aircraft was in radio contact with the Washington Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC), and traveling between the waypoints ASBUR and DENNY on jet airway 42 (J42). The object was witnessed off of the left side of the aircraft traveling north (right to left) at an extremely high velocity. The object appeared spherical in shape and bright white and glowing in color. The object appeared to leave some sort of contrail, which may have been a distortion of light due to speed. The object contained no other sources of light typically found on civilian aircraft. The object disappeared from horizontal view within 2-3 seconds, moving at a speed much greater that that of an approaching opposite direction jet aircraft. The object had an apparent size of 1/4 the circumference of a full moon, and looked similar to a shooting star or meteorite. Size relative to the aircraft could not be determined. The object appeared to be between 35,000 and 38,000 feet, 2,000-5,000 feet above the aircraft. The trajectory of the object resembled an ascending arch. According to NASAâ€™s website, the International Space Station was not in the area at the time of the sighting. Other aircraft were also in the vicinity at the time. The object was witnessed by a more than one person, including trained observers. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and we deem him to be an exceptionally good witness.
