Very Bright Gold/Bronze disc shaped object moving over VA;2011-10-27 04:45:00;20 Minutes;Very Bright Gold/Bronze disc shaped object moving over VA I woke up at about 4:45 am on Oct. 27, 2011.  Looked straight out the window of my bedroom which happens to be right beside my bed and noticed a very bright gold/bronze color object slowly but steadily moving south.  I woke up my wife and told her ‘Look Honey, it’s the International Space Station going by!’, because our local news had been telling us of viewing times we could see it go by a couple of weeks ago.  But this time was different.  All of a sudden it stopped moving and just stayed there.  It appeared that the object was getting a little larger as if it were dropping altitude getting closer. During the time it was closer it looked like quite a few lights were rotating on the bottom.  Then it gained altitude again and stayed there for about 15 minutes.  Then quicker than it came it was gone. The only reason I kept my eye on it was because I thought it was the International Space station going by.  Turns out I don’t have any idea what that thing was.;36.7496;-80.0105
