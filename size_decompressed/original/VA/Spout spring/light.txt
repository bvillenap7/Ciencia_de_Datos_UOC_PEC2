Bright orange light floating over countryside;2017-10-16 22:34:00;3 minuets;Bright orange light floating over countryside I saw an orange light moving west to east.  Object seems to change direction occasionally. Did not hear jet engines, or propeller.  Altitude was approximately 5000 ft.  Object was south of me.  Object did not make any sudden moves during its flight.  I am sure it wasn’t a meteor it was moving too slow. Only a single light was seen, no flickering, was a lot larger than any aircraft light I have seen. Light didn’t appear to luminate like a search light used on aircraft.;37.3643;-78.9059
