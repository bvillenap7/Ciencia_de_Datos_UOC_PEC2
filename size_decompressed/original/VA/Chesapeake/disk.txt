On an early clear morning.  I was standing in my door way of my mobile home and looking up at the SE direction of the clear blue sky I noticed a large white disk shaped object hovering or floating in the sky at a close distance.  I kept my eyes focused on the craft to look for blinking lights to make sure it wasn't an airplane but I didn't see any lights at all, it was just solid white.  I thought it was very unusual and as I kept my eyes focused on the object it just suddenly disappeared. It didn't fly away like an airplane, the craft or object just vanished.
