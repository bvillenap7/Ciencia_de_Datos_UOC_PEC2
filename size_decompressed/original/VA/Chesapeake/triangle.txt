large triangular object that was seen over our home;2005-09-10 03:00:00;25 minutes;large triangular object that was seen over our home We actually observed several incidents between July and mid-September, but this was different from the rest in that it was an enormous triangle shaped object that we estimated to be 300 ft. up over the top of our house. It was not noticeable at first, and what made us notice it was that along the edges of it were lights that at first glance looked like stars but had a pattern to them [triangular]. It made absolutely no noise, and was moving very slowly. We watched for about 20 minutes, but then got freaked out and went inside.This is in the same time frame of other incidents that were seen by ourselves and another friend, when we saw objects in the sky that changed direction extremely fast and had blue and amber lights.

Triangle formation of lights, one green over Dismal Swamp areaChesapeake,  Va;2008-10-24 21:30:00;1 minute;Triangle formation of lights, one green over Dismal Swamp area Chesapeake,  Va I was alone on my way home from Chesapeake to Portsmouth VA, Friday Oct 24, about 9:30 PM. I was driving my usual route on the edge of the Dismal Swamp. My favorite route, Old Mill Rd, is a lonely dark curvy road, with no traffic lights. The sky was a beautiful dark blue. I think the moon was full. The sky was patched with large fluffy white clouds. It's close to deer mating season, and deer run across the road, so my eyes were closely following on the road. Above a clump of Cyprus and Oak trees, I noticed what I thought was an oddly moving jet airliner. I say odd because it moved much slower than a helicopter and emitted no sound. It was also to low to be an airliner. It wasn't a blimp either. The aircraft displayed about 6 or 7 large lights on each side of the chevron or triangular shaped craft with a green light on my left as I looked up. As I stated before, the sky was bright, but it was night. The last time I saw something strange like this I was around 12, 1973.  My brother told me to wait while he went in the house to get Daddy. Heck, no!  I went with him, when Daddy came out it was gone. It was shaped like a shallow bowl on top of a saucer. The aircraft had many windows and lights all around and red lights on top. We saw this aircraft two more times the summer 1974 with my eldest brother and a neighborhood kid. I live 20 miles from Norfolk Naval, Oceana Air Naval and Langley Air Force Base. I have lived within the proximity of naval and air force bases all around me all my life. I have seen plenty of planes, jets, helicopters, Stealth Fighters and jets that take off straight up from a aircraft carrier, but I have never seen something like this and what we saw when I was 12.

Dark triangular craft with bright yellow light and smaller red and blue lights moved at pace of 25-30 mph.;2013-01-06 23:30:00;15 minutes;Dark triangular craft with bright yellow light and smaller red and blue lights moved at pace of 25-30 mph While driving down Kempsville Road near Volvo Parkway in Chesapeake, Va, a triangular shaped craft was spotted in the air about 30-40 feet above the ground.  Initially it held its position for about two mins.  Then slowly, it began to rise up about another ten to 20 feet and traveled west toward the Chesapeake City Park and then northwest toward Battlefield Blvd and Interstate 64. No sound was heard from the craft when it PASSED OVER my vehicle or when it passed over the other witness's residence.  Though, I did notice that the radio in my vehicle was disabled while I was driving and only when I arrived home did the radio turn on without me touching the tuner or volume. The shape of the object was dark and triangular it appeared at first glance to be a bright yellow light.  On closer review, it also had smaller red and blue lights.  None of the lights were blinking or changed within the first four mins, then the bright yellow light began to pulse slowly while the craft was moving throughout the remainder of the sighting.  The craft moved slowly at a 25-30 mph pace. In total the sighting lasted for about 15 mins.;36.7564554016622;-76.3036132963986

Moving triangular shape (lights) across the night sky;2015-01-31 21:00:00;5 minutes;Moving triangular shape (lights) across the night sky I was driving down I-264 headed towards Battlefield Blvd south exit.  Many cars on the road (Saturday night) I noticed two lights in the sky which were moving slowly but quite discernibly in Unison thigh they seemed far apart from each other.  I watched this as much as I could as I drove.   When I took the exit I pulled over as quickly as possible but I could only stay there a few seconds because of the traffic.   I took a picture with my iPhone 6S through the front windshield of my car.  I really didn't think I'd capture anything, but I actually did I will send the pic;36.7564554016622;-76.3036132963986
Hovering triangular craft that took off after being suspended in the air for minimum 5 minutes;2015-11-23 22:00:00;5 minutes;Hovering triangular craft that took off after being suspended in the air for minimum 5 minutes We were driving home from the movies in Chesapeake va back to elizabeth city on 17south and to our left a few miles ahead of us, we saw high in the sky looked that looked like car lights facing the north.  Of course the craft of some sort was a lot bigger but left us thinking is there a giant flying car.  But it was dark and we figured it was lower flying plane.  Then in the background we actually seen a plane which looked like an ant compared to this thing.  As we got closer we were just like maybe it's a light tower of some sort for it hadn't moved since we first saw it.  When we got parallel to it we couldn't imagine a light tower being so high in the sky.  So we pulled over to try and get a better view and that's when it started to move north.  Didn't shoot thru the sky just casually went north towards Chesapeake.  Freaked out that it even started moving we jumped back in our car and took off watching it disappear into the dark night through the side view mirrors.  This wasn't a plane of any sort and I'm a huge skeptic.  Wasn't a chopper.  Something that stays suspended thru the air that long and then takes off it was really odd and got me looking on the Internet for anyone else whom may have seen it.  It also had blinking lights behind it that I saw as it started to take off;36.7564554016622;-76.3036132963986
