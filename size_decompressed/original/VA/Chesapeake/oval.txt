Very Bright yellowish orange. It moved parallel to the ground. the sky was dark and there were only a few lights in the parking lot. The glow from the object was very VERY bright. It moved across the horizon at a slow pace. It looked somewhat oval with a haze surround the edges.  I could tell that it was pretty high up in the sky, but at the same time, it was really big.  There were no trails at all.;36.7564554016622;-76.3036132963986
4 glowing objects about 1/5th the size of a full moon seen on east coast Aug 4th 2001;2001-08-04 23:00:00;15seconds;4 glowing objects about 1/5th the size of a full moon seen on east coast Aug 4th 2001 In Chesapeake Va August 4th at 11:00 my wife and me were sitting outside and witnessed the following: Four objects that were about the size of a quall egg held at arms length. They were all a light yellow/green glow of light and traveling in the same direction. They were at the ~height that planes fly based upon some small clouds they crossed above. They could not have been metal because you could see the distinct shape due to the finely detailed illumination of the vessel? They seemed to be just an energy source. They flew directly across taking ~15 seconds to cross the entire horizon. They also stayed in the same formation and were several miles apart. I know this could not have been a plane or balloon. It was like seeing a glowing ping-pong ball move across the sky. Anyone on the east coast see this?;36.7564554016622;-76.3036132963986
