At least twelve red round spheres of light were traveling in the night sky.  One by one they traveled from right to left. Originally, they looked to form a V shape, and then they appeared to straighten out.  They did not flash or flicker.  They were all a solid red color. There was no noise coming from them.   They just kept coming.  Then they slowing started ascending in the sky at about a 40 degree angle. As they ascended they disappeared.  About seven mintues later a military plane came to my area and hovered. I heard the plane coming and saw it hover with lights on as if checking out the area.;36.7564554016622;-76.3036132963986
