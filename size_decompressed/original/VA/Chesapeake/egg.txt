We do not have ac or heat in his car so we were cruising with all the windows down on Moses Grandy Trail.  As we passed the 50 speed limit sign and the road starts to curve the exact spot where we saw the UFO is: https://maps.app.goo.gl/TgZidfvRYAtaFKxs5  That's when we both saw a bright green light make a V shape and darted over and behind the trees next to the moon on the right.  The UFO was a very clear upside diamond or egg shape.. as it zipped down and the UFO made a loop and went round side up flying straight over and behind the trees.  There was a lot of traffic and it was right in the middle of the sky close to the roadway.  Overall the encounter lasted for a total of 30 seconds.  When it shot behind the trees next to the moon it just hovered and slowly became a tiny dot like it was flying out of the atmosphere.  I have included so! me drawn images of the UFO and the flight path it took.;36.7564554016622;-76.3036132963986
