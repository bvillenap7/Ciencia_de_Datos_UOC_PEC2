Ufo orbs over skys in Chesapeake, VA;2010-05-28 21:30:00;10 mins;Ufo orbs over skys in Chesapeake, VA Last night my family (husband, 2 daughters) and I were in the pool late.  My daughter pointed to the sky and said what's that?  We are in the flight pattern for the airport where we are so I had thought it was just a plane but it had no flashing light on it at all.  It moved from left to right then to the left again.  Then it looked as it was coming back toward us and then looked as if there were 2 orbs of light in the air then that were very close together.  To me they looked very white in color.  My husband saw it a little different through his video camera on his phone. In his camera they looked as they were changing color from like a pink to blue to white but I could not see that with my bare eyes only on his phone in the video.  It was in the sky for about 10 mins then it just disapeared.;36.7564554016622;-76.3036132963986

Slow moving object white in color moved away at a very high rate of speed,;2014-04-05 21:00:00;10 minutes;slow moving object white in color moved away at a very high rate of speed, On April 5, 2014 between 2100 hrs. and 2200 hrs. I was in my front yard with my dogs. It was a clear cool night the moon was out and the stars were brilliant. As I turned I glanced in the Southern part of the sky and observed a very bright star.  Then it dawned on me I had not seen a bright star in that part of the sky.  It was approximately 60 degrees up.   After looking I thought it must be a plane.  The area I live in has many military bases were planes and land and take off through out the day and night. There is a Coast Guard Base about 50 miles away in North Carolina and helicopters fly to the Norfolk Naval Base.  We also have the Norfolk Internationl Air Port where commercial planes land and take off so I thought nothing of it. Later I looked at the object again and it was closer at about the same angle. I wondering why it was so bright then concluded it must have its landing lights on.  I could not see the red and green flashing lights on the wings and thought the landing lights were blocking them I turned and went back playing with my dogs.  There were other planes in the area I could see their flashing red and greenl lights on the wings.   Some were making their turn for Norfolk Airport and otheres heading towards other places. I looked again and the object made a slight course change rather quickly.  It was not a big move but was abrupt.  As I took my dogs back to the house I glanced again at the object and realized it was not a plane.  The total time I had been and outside playing with the dogs and watching this object was about 10 minutes. While in the house I grabbed my Nikon 10x50 binocluars went out side and observed the object through the binocluars.  At this time it was at about an 80 degree angle almost directly over me, I had to lean against a post on my porch to steady the binocluars. It was bright white with a haze around the edges and in the shape of a circle.  I called my wife and asked her what she thought that was pointing to the object she replied a plane.  I handed the glasses to her she looked and said on my God.  Then she said it was gone. I grabbed the binocluars found the object whchi had moved in a North East direction very fast it was no a pin point of light orange in color and about 20 to 30 degress.  It got smaller appeared to go in to a haze then it was gone.  From the time I took the glasses and the object disappeared was from 5 to 10 seconds. I have thought about this and believe the object was above the Earths' atmosphere. The bright white was a reflection off of the objects surface.  That would also explain why there was no sonic boom when the object sped away.  I now believe that the object did not change color to orange but as it sped away the atomsphere gave the impression the color change.  I have observed this when I look at a star in that direction that appears to be orange.  This object must have been massive.;36.7564554016622;-76.3036132963986
4 circular bright orange balls in sky over Centerville Turnpike in Chesapeake, racing with and around each other, then disappearing.;2015-09-05 20:30:00;several minutes;4 circular bright orange balls in sky over Centerville Turnpike in Chesapeake, racing with and around each other, then disappearing. Our family was driving home from a dinner date with friends in Kill Devil Hills.  We were on Centerville Turnpike and 4 bright orange glowing circular objects appeared out of nowhere in front of us high in the night sky.  They were appeared to be racing together and around each other.  Then, they immediately changed directions (took a hard right turn) and one flew faster and pasted the others.  Then they disappeared.;36.7564554016622;-76.3036132963986
Quantum UFO;2018-09-16 22:49:00;1:15;Quantum UFO I was sitting out front smoking and whistling like what I believe UFO energy feels like.  I had my phone recording straight, left and right pointed at a tree.  Then, at 1 minute and 9 seconds, this white UFO of energy shoots up at the very top of the tree.  It looked like some kind of quantum energy.  This is very real.   The video is located here on my web server:   www.consciousmystery.net/ufo.mp4.   I bless all eyes so you can see what I see.;36.7564554016622;-76.3036132963986

I saw a bright-white orb appear (clear sky), travel 5 sec.parallel to the east coastline heading N, then disappear.;2019-08-13 05:20:00;5 seconds;I saw a bright-white orb appear (clear sky), travel 5 sec.parallel to the east coastline heading N, then disappear. It was the early morning hours of September 13th, and the last day of a three day meteor shower.  I often enjoy these events and didn’t want to miss the last morning of the event.  I got up and went outside with a pillow to lie down on our bench to get a good general view of the sky before the sunrise.  My feet were facing south, my left shoulder to the east coast (the sun was beginning to rise a bit). I caught the first meteor in the upper right quadrant of view…. It was orange in color and zipped the usual speed (1/4-1/2 second in length).  A few minutes later I saw the second…in the bottom left quadrant….same seed.  It was bright white in color.  I then noticed an airplane…flashing lights in the right, middle area of my general sight.  It was going the usual speed….and quite a bit slower in speed as the meteors….I do not recall if I heard it. Then (at the same time as the plane was flying from right to left in the middle of my vision), all of a sudden a white orb appeared to the left of mid-field.... out of nowhere.  It was a circle/ball of light….opaque in substance as best as I could tell with my eyes.  There were no clouds in the sky (except a long thin one that was at the bottom of my field of sight).  The orb was quite a bit larger than the meteors…..about the size of a red light when you are stopped about 4 cars back.  Best I could tell it was way over the tree line but below the height of the airplane.  It traveled south to north for about 5 full seconds and then just disappeared.  It was traveling at least 4 times as fast as the airplane, but at least 4 times slower than the meteors.  It didn’t waver there was no sound no pulsing it followed a straight line….and just…was gone.  I have never seen anything like it and I am an avid sky-watcher.  Whatever it was…it seemed to follow the coastline.;36.7564554016622;-76.3036132963986
