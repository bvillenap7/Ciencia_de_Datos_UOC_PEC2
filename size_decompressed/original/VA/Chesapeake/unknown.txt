At first glance we thought it was a plane, but then realized there was no blinking light.  We concluded it couldnt be a commercial flight plane moving that fast and if it was a jet plane we would have been able to hear it.  As we continued driving the UFO traveled at a 75 degree angel and then made a very sharp left, which is impossible for a plane,;36.7564554016622;-76.3036132963986
Bright, strange light.;2010-05-15 00:30:00;>5 minutes;Bright, strange light. We were watching the planes and satellites one night and noticed an unusually bright light.  We quickly ruled out the possibility of it being any man made object as it stopped mid-flight for a few seconds and moved in a completely different direction.  The object moved for a few more seconds then stopped once more, but instead of moving it just sat there for quite some time.   We went inside before it ever moved again.;36.7564554016622;-76.3036132963986
Two intense, multi-colored, pulsating lights/objects aloft in vicinity of Chesapeake, VA;2012-01-24 18:20:00;10 min;Two intense, multi-colored, pulsating lights/objects aloft in vicinity of Chesapeake, VA Chesapeake, VA, (approx 36-44N 76-13W) on 24 Jan 2012 from approx 1820-1830 EST while grilling on the BBQ, I noticed an intensely bright, pulsating, multi-color light (altenating red, blue, violet) in the air to the west of my location at about a 45 degree inclination above the horizon.   At first I thought it may be a helicopter, as it appeared to be “hovering”.  I then saw a second, similar light to the left (SW) of it at a lower altitude.  Having no point of reference, I could not estimate the distance, but guess at least several hundred yards up to a mile.  They each then began to display an “on-off” flashing yellow-white light in addition to the pulsating, changing color lights and they began very quick, erratic, “hummingbird-like”, “dancing” movements, up, down, left, right over great distance.  I was once a high speed  morse code operator and could not distinguish any intelligible “code” from the flashing lights, although they did appear to be in deliberate! pattern/sequence, not random. The flashing light of the second object appeared to respond to the first. A few minutes after first observing the lights/objects, a small, single engine propeller aircraft approached from west to east  (common route to/from Chesapeake Municipal & Norfolk International airports).  The plane was at about 1500 feet altitude. As the plane approached, the two lights/objects quickly dropped from view below the treeline several hundred yards to my west. After the plane had passed overhead and to the east, the two lights/objects quickly reappeared and continued their “dance” for a few more minutes before disappearing. It was a clear evening, shortly after sunset with only several high altitude jet aircraft vapor trails visible in the night sky. A partial moon was in view to the northwest. Other than the bright lights, where the yellow-white flashing lights were to the immediate left of the multi-colored, pulsating “halogen-like” ones, I could not discern any form or shape of the objects from which they emanated. There was absolutely no sound coming from them that I could hear. They were like nothing I’d ever seen.  Surely they were not from conventional aircraft, fixed wing or rotary, and they were definitely not weather balloons or “natural phenomena”.  I thought possibly kids with REALLY sophisticated radio-controlled devices? Maybe, but I really don’t think so. In any case, I’ve never reported anything like this before, and seeing them is what caused me to search the internet for similar sightings, which brought me to this web site.  I’m neither a “believer” nor “non-believer” in UFO’s.  My jury is still out.  But I did nearly burn my chicken.  A small price to pay for a really interesting light show. I am a 30 year military career retiree still serving as a civilian in security management.;36.7564554016622;-76.3036132963986
Started out as 1 object and then 2 with pulsating white/red lights;2015-10-07 18:50:00;7 minutes;Started out as 1 object and then 2 with pulsating white/red lights I saw it as I was driving on I-664 and exiting towards I-64W.  It appeared to be one flying craft at first that was vertically aligned almost shaped like a Z with white and red lights.  The shape then changed and appeared horizontal and then half disappeared like it separated into 2 separate objects.  The one flying object had pulsating/flashing lights.  I could see the object was moving and appeared to be descending quickly-the lights flashed pulsating off & on and when it would come on it was several hundred miles lower in the sky until it just disappeared behind the tree line.

Just it was strange so early.  ((anonymous report));2018-01-13 03:00:00;1 minute;Just it was strange so early Traveled very fast very high altitude with two lights (red/green flashing).  Sound of engines delayed 30 second after sight.  Clear skies tonight, bright stars and only one cloud wispy by at first glance before the aircraft.

Very bright blinking white object in early morning western sky on 12/26/2020;2020-12-26 06:15:00;5 minutes;Very bright blinking white object in early morning western sky on 12/26/2020 Early in the morning today (the 26th) when going to my car to get my morning coffee, I was able to see a very bright flashing white light in the western sky.  It was extremely bright when blinking, but when it wasn't blinking I could not see anything since it was still dark out.  It looked like a very bright pulsing star.  Plus was about 1 second on, 2 seconds off it seemed... also, object didn't move.. when I left to get a better view, I saw it one more time on the way to get coffee, then I lost it as it got bright out.;36.7564554016622;-76.3036132963986
