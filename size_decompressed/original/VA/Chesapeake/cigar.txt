I saw 5 cigar shaped crafts in a V formation with lights.;2001-12-11 14:03:00;6 Minutes;I saw 5 cigar shaped crafts in a V formation with lights. When I was getting lunch this afternoon, I heard a slight whistling/whining sound coming from outside of my house. I looked out onto the street and saw nothing. When I looked in the air, however, I saw 5 cigar shaped craft. All of them were heading west and were in a V type formation. There were 2 lights emitted from the crafts at each end and they were flashing on and off. They were all going at a fairly fast pace and kept the same pace through the entire sighting. When I was about to pull out my camera, they pulled up and started to go faster and faster until they vanished. ((NUFORC Note:  No other reports from this individual's grade-school.

The object was cigar shaped and did not have any wings or rodar.;2003-05-06 12:45:00;10 to 12 sec.;The object was cigar shaped and did not have any wings or rodar. I was on my way to work and witnessed a cigar shaped object about 1000ft in the sky.  The object appeared to hover, the craft was dark grey, possibly had black markings - hard to tell considering I had to keep my eyes on the road half the time.  I only saw the craft/object for about 10 sec. and only saw it while I was on the overpass considering the trees blocking the view. I also reported this to a local news channel.  I most definatly noticed that this craft did not have any wings nor did it have any resemblince to an helicopter.  This was something of a different type.;36.7564554016622;-76.3036132963986
Cigar shaped object hovering in sky.;2018-04-06 13:00:00;1 minute;Cigar shaped object hovering in sky I was turning onto my street coming home from lunch, and noticed a white/silver, cigar shaped, object hovering in the sky.  There were many commercial aircraft in the air at the time, flying in all directions, leaving chem trails.   I proceeded to pull over so I could take a picture with my phone.  As I got out of the car, the object disappeared.   This was not a plane.  It hovered in the sky and almost appeared to wobble.;36.7564554016622;-76.3036132963986
