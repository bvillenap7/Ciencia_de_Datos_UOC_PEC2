I saw a strange sight in the early morning sky on 10/18/2011 at about 5:30 am, over Chesapeake, VA.  I've always been one to check out the night sky looking for meteors, satellites, planets, etc. But, I've never seen what I saw this morning in over 40 years of sky watching. I noticed a bright light moving from the NorthEast to the South, below the moon which was directly overhead. The path was not low, but not high in the night sky, about the level of Orion's belt to the right of the moon. I originally thought it was a satellite that had caught the morning sun not yet above the horizon. As I watched, the bright light became fainter, almost disappearing, but the object was still visible on it's path. Then, the object became really bright again, then fainter, then bright, then faint before disappearing totally.  The speed of the object as it moved across the sky was similar to a satellite - not fast, but steady. There was no jet noise, that I would have heard if this was an airplane of some kind.  Jets fly overhead all the time and usually there is some level of noise even at the highest altitudes, especially during the quiet morning. I'm not sure what I saw, but there was something unusual in the sky. BTW - there were no clouds - not even wispy ones - in the sky for the object to hide behind this morning.;36.7564554016622;-76.3036132963986
orange flashing lights in sky;2012-06-30 22:00:00;On Going;orange flashing lights in sky My grandmother and I walked outside and spotted two orange lights moving at a steady pace in the night sky, blinking from orange to white in a rhythmic pattern.   The lights moved independently from each other, and would constantly changed direction at random from one end of the sky to the other.   We started to head inside once a HUGE thunder/lightening storm began to form (still currently storming).   Before walking inside, I was able to make out more detail on one of them, and it seemed to be made of three lights, not one.  It may have resembled a triangular shape, but I didnt have enough time to be sure.   Eventually the clouds rolled in so thick, my view was completely obstructed.;36.7564554016622;-76.3036132963986
Multi-color emitting light/star in the sky, extra brilliant, vanishes.;2013-02-16 02:00:00;10 minutes;Multi-color emitting light/star in the sky, extra brilliant, vanishes. I walked out onto my back porch with a friend, and immediately noticed a very bright, energetic light in the western sky.  It appeared to be a star, but was much much brighter than any other star, and looking closer, I saw that the light source was 'twinkling' various many different colors other than white, mainly red, green, and blue. I cannot stress how much brighter this light was compared to the other stars in the sky, including the big dipper which appeared large in the sky and was directly overhead.  I also cannot stress how colorful the light was.  I was literally in awe trying to explain it to myself. It was not a radio tower, with a distinctive, predictable white or red blinking. It was not a helicopter or an airplane, as it was completely stationary in the sky and appeared to be very far away.  Only the brightness of the object could have made it appear to be within the atmosphere. In awe of and unable to explain what I was looking at, I went back inside to grab some other people, but when we went outside the light was gone. I'm not sure what it was.  One of my theories is that I witnessed the images of the death of a star, a supernova, however many light years away it was, that were just now reaching Earth. Has anybody heard of a supernova or other explainable cosmological event that would have been visible between 2-3 AM Saturday the 16th of February 2013, in the west/southwestern sky of Chesapeake, VA?

Large bright blue light in the sky breaks into three lights and descends.;2014-02-08 18:00:00;5 seconds;Large bright blue light in the sky breaks into three lights and descends I was on my way home between 6 pm and 6:15 and I saw a large bright blue light in the sky.  It looked like it was falling so my first thought is that it was a meteor.  Then it broke into 3 lights.  They all kept going in a downward direction but I lost sight of them due to the high tree line behind the houses on my street.  The sighting only lasted 4 or 5 seconds.  The lights  seemed close.  There were no tails on the lights as there often are with shooting stars.  I work for a defense contractor.;36.7564554016622;-76.3036132963986
Odd blinking light in sky moving in odd ways.  ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling star, possibly Sirius.  PD));2014-12-14 20:12:00;30+ minutes;Odd blinking light in sky moving in odd ways. My family and I had just gotten back home from going out to eat and my son saw Orion’s belt in the sky.  He asked if he could break out his telescope and look at the stars since the moon’s not out.  We said sure and went into the back yard to do a little stargazing. We had been outside for about 20 minutes and had seen a few shooting stars and a few planes.  We all kind of fixated on this one light though that my wife thought was a plane because you could see it blinking, but I thought was something else (honestly, I thought it was a star) because I was able to lock in on it through the telescope.  I said that if it were a plane, then I wouldn’t be able to hold it in the telescope long enough that we could all take a look at it. We started watching it at about 2012 as it started to do some pretty weird things.  First it would blink like crazy (white, red, and blue), then it would just sort of twinkle a little.  Then it started swinging left and right, just sort of rocking back and forth.  It also started bouncing up and down in the sky and doing loops (moving in a circle) in front of us.  I saw three planes in the sky around this odd light that were able to move along like I had seen most planes do, but this thing was still in more or less the same place it had been at when we first saw it after almost half an hour. At 2040, we decided that we needed to go in since it was cold and the kids have school in the morning.  We ran into my neighbor, who we showed the light in the sky to, and he said, “That’s cool.” And then went to get his wife to show her too.  That’s when I came inside and started talking about maybe calling the local police or something.  My wife was outside still, but when she came in she asked if I was serious, told me that she had seen the light go out and come back on again, and then looked up a way to report a U.F.O.

Star like light over Chesapeake suddenly accelerates across the night sky;2015-07-04 22:00:00;~70 minutes;Star like light over Chesapeake suddenly accelerates across the night sky Strange lights.  I'm here in Virginia visiting close friends when I spotted something unusual in the night sky!  We'd spent the 4th enjoying the celebrations etc..  However, around 8.45 to 9 pm, I realised everyone sleeping, so I decided to go out into the back yard and watch a local fireworks display. I was sitting there enjoying the show when I spotted what I thought was an aircraft in the night sky. It was visible over the house in a north-westerly direction and I estimate at about 35 degrees from the horizon.  Again, still thinking it was an aircraft, I ignored it and continued watching the fireworks. A few minuets passed when I realised it was still there at which point I assumed it was a very bright star which, I found unusual as the night sky was a cloudy.   Nevertheless, I continued to watch the firework. Suddenly, I'm estimating a little after 10pm I heard a firework land out front.  Now at this point, I knew everyone was sleeping and the garage door was open, so I figured I'd better go close it.  However, just at that moment, I glanced up at the star and watched in amazement as it just shot off across the sky and out of sight heading from it stationary  north west position in a west-south-west direction. Object:  Bright star like light object  Location:  Northwestern sky, approximately 35 degrees off the horizon.  Stationary. Duration (time first noted):  Approximately 70 minutes   Eventual direction of travel:  west-south-west  Weather:  A cloudy but dry. I'm not sure what I witnessed, but I'm sure it wasn't an aircraft or firework, or anything of that nature, because if I hadn't moved, I have went to bed thinking it was a bright star!;36.7564554016622;-76.3036132963986

I had seen a light moving in the sky and did not see any flashing lights which raised my interest.  As I continued to follow the light with my eyes for a couple minutes,  it slowly faded away.  About one minute after the disappearance, there was an extremely fast flash across the night sky in the same vicinity.

At approximately 1:41 a.m, I was driving home after a late dinner/early breakfast and saw a good sized yellowish orb of light slowly moving across the sky at cloud level.  I pulled off the road to observe.  Initially, it was a solid orb of light.   I watched it for a minute or two, then called my 20 year old using my cell phone.  I wanted her to go outside (from home) so she could see what I was seeing.  About 15 seconds into our 1 minute and 29 second conversation, the orb starting blinking on and off at something close to half-second intervals.  As we were ending our conversation, it blinked one more time and then disappeared completely. About 15 to 20 seconds after the last blink, a second faster moving craft appeared lower in the sky.  I couldn't quite make out its shape, but it had rapidly blinking bright red and white lights (almost like an ambulance), with a solid blue light in the center.  At the risk of sounding stupid, it appeared to be chasing the first object.  It passed behind a tree and I wasn't able to find it again.  I don't know if it also disappeared, or if I simply couldn't see it at this point. All of this took place in a span of about 5 minutes. I should probably also add that all four of the car's windows were down and I heard no sound coming from either craft. While not relevant to this incident, approximately 3 months ago, I experienced a somewhat similar event. I observed a bright white orb of light moving slowly toward me beneath the clouds.  After a minute or so, a smaller orb seemed to separate itself from the larger and move off to its right side.  It was immediately followed by a third orb which moved off to its left side, forming a somewhat sloppy triangle.  All three remained for another 15 seconds and then simply disappeared.  There was nothing to interfere with my view.  They were there, and then they were gone. These were also soundless.;36.7564554016622;-76.3036132963986
Floating Light Vanishes Above Greenbrier, Chesapeake, VA;2020-07-12 10:26:00;30 seconds;Floating Light Vanishes Above Greenbrier, Chesapeake, VA Me and my girlfriend were in the car driving home after some stargazing when all of the sudden she started saying something to me along the lines of, “That is not a star DUDE WHAT IS THAT!! Look there’s a light just sitting still in the sky!!!” I was the one driving, so I was trying to pay attention to the road but look at the same time. I did not see what she was talking about at first, and then all of the sudden I saw through the trees what she was talking about - a bright, brilliant white light just sitting still in the sky. It was about 3 miles away, just above the tree-line in the distance. I would say it was a mile high. As soon as I saw what she was talking about, I changed route to go to a parking lot close by to get a better view on the object. After seeing it, i drive for about 100 feet, when all of the sudden it had just vanished. It was clearly not a man made aircraft, clearly not a spotlight, and 100% not a celestial body.;36.7564554016622;-76.3036132963986
