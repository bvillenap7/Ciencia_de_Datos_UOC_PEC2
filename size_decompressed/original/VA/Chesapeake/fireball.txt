During twilight at approx. 7:45 pm looking straight up (12:00 pos.) and bringing my eyes down to the 11:00 position due east, an extremely bright star-like object appeared, traveling southeast very slowly for 2-3 second (maybe due to a very steep trajectory): the distance with hand outstretched was the length of my thumb. Then the object faded to a small red dot and turned south, doubled its speed, and traveled another 4-5 seconds before completely disappearing without a trace.;36.7564554016622;-76.3036132963986
