Glowing green UFO in Virginia;2012-01-04 22:20:00;5 seconds;Glowing green UFO in Virginia I had been driving for about two minutes, there was no traffic as it was around 10:20pm. I caught a glimpse of a very bright green light delivering approximately double the luminescence of the north star, and was two or three times the size of the north star when comparing the two. The glowing object came from the top right portion of my wind-shield and swooped to the left high in the sky. As I followed the object it made a noticeable arching movement until it was nearly beside the north star, the it simply swooped downward like a slower moving falling star. The speed of the object was not as fast as what I can compare to a falling star, nor was it as slow as a plane or helicopter. The object was not blinking, just a constant and vibrant green glow.;37.7924;-78.8684
