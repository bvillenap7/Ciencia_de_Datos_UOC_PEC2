Then about 5 minutes later the object seem to come straight down leaving another vapor trail.  Before the horizion the object stop leaving the vapor trail.  There was no fire ball or glowing with this object going up or coming down.  The object seem to be launch from the air because there was no vapor trail going up before the spiral.  This is east toward Richmond, Williamsburg, Norfolk, VA.  There was no glow of anything hitting the ground.  Unsure about the distance Richmond is 100 miles from my house.  The down vapor trail had reflective light for along time.  More so then going up. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the observer erred in indicating the date of 05JL99.  We think the event he alludes to is the launching of two missiles out of the U. S. Navy Wallops Island, VA, Flight Test Facility.  We have changed the date.  PD));37.7924;-78.8684

I looked up and clearly saw a silver object flying quite high at a slow pace toward Roanoke in a southwesterly direction. I thought it was a plane, but it was really too far to describe its shape. I said out loud that itâ€™s heading to Roanoke. My wife said it is too high to be landing in Roanoke (about eighty miles from where we stood.) We were watching it and it vanished in an instant. Nothing gradual about it. We saw moving slowly and then it was gone. There were no lights or no com trail.;37.7924;-78.8684
