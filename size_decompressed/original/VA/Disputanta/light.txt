Flashing, strobing lights filling all areas of the sky;2002-11-06 19:30:00;approx 30 min;Flashing, strobing lights filling all areas of the sky See Previous report dated 3/30/01 from Disputanta. I sent you the video. No need to include this in your database. Thought you might like to know that this happened again. But this time there were so many planes and lights all over the sky (from EVERY direction in the sky) for over a 30 min period. The lights strobed as they did before. There were lights that were headed in one direction and turned on a dime and headed in the opposite direction. I personally witnessed not one, but TWO objects that were moving so fast they appeared to be meteors (shooting stars)...that is how fast they moved. I couldn't possible describe them as they were just a blur. Military jets came out for the occasion and circled the area. I certainly can't state whether they were part of this anomoly or checking it all out. They normally fly over during maneuvers, but not at night. There was one jet that flew a complete 360 and then a second. It was incredibly busy out here tonight and oh so strange. I would love to get this on video, but don't know what to use to capture this activity so that it is visible. I might add you CAN hear the planes.....there were a couple over the 30 min period that WERE planes and then the military jets. But I would say there were thirty to fifty objects that made no sound, made no sense as far as movement and of course the strobing lights. I just can't imagine that one would see thirty to fifty planes in the air within a thirty to forty five minute period. Curious. Just FYI and for the record. I fully expect to see this again and maybe it will be another two years, but I will be watchful.  ((name deleted));37.1493;-77.2726
