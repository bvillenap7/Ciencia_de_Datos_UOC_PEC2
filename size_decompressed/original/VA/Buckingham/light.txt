Large, bright light moving slowly across the sky at low altitude;2020-07-16 21:15:00;45 seconds;Large, bright light moving slowly across the sky at low altitude Firstly, some context: despite how odd it may sound, I spend every spare moment of my time documenting anomalies (both in the sky and at ground level), so I’m not reporting the following because the incident was unusual for me personally. Instead, I am reporting it because it occurred at 9:15 PM on the evening of July 16, 2020, and is VERY similar to the witness report made only 2 days later from Lakeview, Ohio, which I noticed on your homepage just this evening (October 19, 2020). I use your site as a resource for finding commonalities between my own experiences and what others may be seeing in roughly the same time frame, so I felt that it may be beneficial to someone if I reported this, seeing as how there was already one report made that was so similar – if there was a trend of sightings that week which occurred elsewhere, it may help to determine the path this anomaly was following during that time period (assuming that it is in fact the same object in the report from Ohio). The circumstances of the sighting were simple – I was conducting one of my regular, routine “sky watch” sessions and noticed this coming over, moving roughly south-to-north at approximately 9:15 PM. There was no sound associated with the object, and it moved steadily and slowly, without blinking.  Unbeknownst to me, at some point prior to that,  I had accidentally bumped the focus ring on the front of my camera (a Sionyx Aurora), and in the video you’ll hear me fussing because I can’t figure out why the camera wouldn’t come into sharp focus . It wasn’t until later that evening I figured out the problem, so unfortunately, the clip is slightly blurry.;37.5807;-78.6006
