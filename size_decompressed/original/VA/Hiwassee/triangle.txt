Classic TR3B with red pulsating disk in center accompanied by jets.;2016-10-13 21:30:00;2 minutes;Classic TR3B with red pulsating disk in center accompanied by jets This happened about 2-1/2 years ago, so I believe it happened on Thursday night. The exact time was about 21:30 or 22:30z half past one of those hours. I was watching TV and I heard a loud continuous roar outside. At first I thought it was military craft that flies overhead, from time to time, but there was no Doppler change in the roar. I looked outside to see several bright lights approaching from the west. I am located at about a 2400 ft altitude, and my guess these craft were about 5000 or 6000 ft AGL.  It was a partially cloudy night, no moon.  A large jet probably C17 was in front. Behind it was the classic TR3B I had read about. Bright specular steady white lights at each or the three points on the delta. A very large circular red disk in the center of it slowly pulsating from dim red to full off at about a 1.5 second periodicity. I could barely make out it’s silhouette. The “C17 (?)” had a four-engine sound with Doppler and nav lights.The steady non-Doppler roar was from the giant triangle behind it. It’s wing span was about four times that of the 4-engine jet in front.  Flanking each of the triangle’s side tips were jets with steady white lights. I could not make those out. All four craft were black. The red disk was a uniform light across its surface when it glowed. The red disk diameter was about 1/5 the breadth of the span of the triangle back tip to back tip.  About 1 minute later what sounded like two F-15’s on full afterburner came from the same direction and seemed to chase after the four craft.  I delayed reporting because I wanted to see if anyone else saw it or reported it, and there was no other report filed.;36.9756;-80.6695
