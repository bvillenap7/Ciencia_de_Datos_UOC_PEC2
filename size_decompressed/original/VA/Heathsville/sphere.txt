Silent orange glowing ball seen in sky over heathsville;2011-12-25 16:45:00;30 seconds;Silent orange glowing ball seen in sky over heathsville We saw an orange ball in the distant that looked like the sun reflecting off of a jet. As it moved closer we realized that it wasn't making any noise and wasn't a jet. It moved over us and looked like a orange glowing sphere. As it moved away over the water it flickered and then disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));37.9008;-76.4114
