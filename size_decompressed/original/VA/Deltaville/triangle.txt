My daughter and I were breaking up a pumpkin for our chickens by throwing it up in the air.  She paused for a second, pointed to the sky and said, daddy look at that rocket ship.  This is something she says often and it’s usually a plane with the vapor trails behind it.  I hesitated to look, she said it again so I changed my position to see it through the trees.  I saw the “craft” and it didn’t look like the usual plane with trails.  It had a look of red to it and I started to think maybe meteor.  But it was to controlled and the trails behind it weren’t like a plane but also not like a meteor.  I have seen rockets take off from Wallops Island and this was a different coarse, across the sky, south to north about.  I then thought with the sunset that maybe it was a reflection on a plane creating the effect.  I looked over at the sunset and the two didn’t really line up.  I changed my point of view as it was flying with a tree in my yard blocking the view.  I ! saw very clearly where it would re appear from the branches but it never did.  There was a very clear sky and no other obstructions near by.  We could not find it.  Definitely odd.   I wish I took a picture but it was gone by the time I got to this realization.   There must have been others that saw this.;37.5588;-76.347
