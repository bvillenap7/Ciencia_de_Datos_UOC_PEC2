We were all in my backyard I randomly was looking at the sky. I initially saw what I had thought was just a jet gleaming in the sun towards the Northeast.  When I kept it in my sight and focused on it more I realized it was actually a ball of light, similar to a star. It looked as if it were reflecting the sun off and on, being visible one second and then not the next. What threw me off and caused me to point it out to my friends is that it crossed the flight path of a westbound plane (right over the top of the plane.)  It also had no contrail or jet stream. Yet the most spectacular thing, and what really blew my mind, was that the ball of light at one point multiplied into what seemed like a countless number of the same ball all moving together within the same area as if they were flocking together around the original ball of light. We watched it as it was to the East of us moving Southbound across the sky and it continued to expand and contract into various numbers of balls of light, again all of the same size and moving in the same pattern.  We observed it continue to move south and at one point it stopped above a treeline and one of friends said that it formed a triangle.  It disappeared for a moment and then appeared again at one point above us moving Southwest diagonally across my house. After that we didn't see any more unidentified activity, however we did see a FCPD helicopter fly in the general direction of the balls of light at a rapid pace.  I don't know if the helicopter and what we saw were correlated but the helicopter did seem to be in a hurry.
