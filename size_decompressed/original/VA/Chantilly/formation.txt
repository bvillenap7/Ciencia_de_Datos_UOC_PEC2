Approximately 20 orange lights in formation moving with no sound.;2013-01-10 21:05:00;2  minutes;Approximately 20 orange lights in formation moving with no sound I was traveling south on Route 28 going approximately 60 mph when I noticed a non uniform string of bright orange lights stretching from East to West (toward Dulles International Airport). The lights were visible from my driver's door window, across my windshield, and through the passenger window.  The distance of this view was at a minimum 1 mile across. Because I was driving and did not stop, I could not ascertain the speed of the lights. Other vehicles had stopped on the road to look.  I thought they were helicopters, but when I opened my window, I heard no sound. I found many references on the internet to similar sightings in this exact area and in neighboring counties, some with photos that look exactly like the lights I saw.  Those descriptions also noted an absence of sound. ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the date above to reflect a sighting in 2013.
