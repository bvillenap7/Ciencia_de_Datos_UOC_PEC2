Disk-like glowing craft in Chantilly flying low in stormy clouds in a horizontal pattern;2010-10-29 08:10:00;4 seconds;Disk-like glowing craft in Chantilly flying low in stormy clouds in a horizontal pattern The craft was disk-like in shape and appeared behind a cloud into plain view for several seconds and then flew behind another cloud in a slanted direction from the horizon towards the north.  The light was hazy and bright and quite low to the ground: not where bird fly, typically, but probably a few hundred feet higher.  Though the clouds were somewhat dark and thick that night and we were driving (roughly) in the same direction the craft was heading, we didn't see it again.  There were two of us that saw the craft and we both commented on both the odd shape as well as how low it was flying. Not to mention, the direction was not horizontal as a plane would fly.  These were not flood lights either as the craft was unmistakably a shape and glowing.  Flood lights reflect on the clouds: no comparison.  We didn't have time to react to get any audio.  The time was about 3-4 seconds at most for the sighting.;38.8909705521471;-77.4676337423311
Disk shaped light (red, yellow, green looked like a ladder coming out the back.;2018-07-18 00:00:00;20 minutes;Disk shaped light (red, yellow, green looked like a ladder coming out the back. Live near Dulles Airport, looked out my window (I can see planes as they climb).  No planes were taking off but as I checked each side of the house I saw (looked disk shaped) with colored lights and what looked like a ladder hanging off it.  I saw four closer to the ground and two above the clouds.  Thinking that this could be one of ours, and not trusting myself, I went out on my patio deck, that is where two came very close together (my perception of space) then about a few seconds later, one just shot off and up and disappeared.  Still no planes at Dulles, I don't know if they were Black Hawks, weather balloons, needlessly to say, I did not sleep well and the pictures I took with my cell phone did not pick them up.  I have a flip phone!  So I sent the dark photos to my daughter and she zoomed in with her phone and caught the something in the sky!;38.8909705521471;-77.4676337423311
