A flash of light looking like very bright sunlight glint off an aircraft appeared in clear sky about 2000 feet up.  I initially thought it was an airliner (Dulles Airport nearby) but it’s path was more east to west while normal path or airliners landing at Dulles is south to north.  I was driving south and was wondering what aircraft would be flying in that direction (size of glint made me thing is was a low flying aircraft) and it just disappeared.  There was no traffic so I slow my car scanning for whatever it was but it just vanished or at least I could no longer see any light refection off its surface.   There was nothing tall enough in the vicinity I could attribute to causing this irregularly shaped bright light. This is second time I’ve seen a UFO in my life.  The first time was I was in northern Wisconsin in the 1970s when I saw a stationary cigar shaped object very high in the sky.  I could only see it that time because the sun was glinting of its metallic body.  That one was huge and its shape was very distinct.  Today’s phenomenon was very different as it was moving and had an irregular shaped, very bright light or reflection, long and narrow but not distinct and flying at a much lower altitude in the sky.;38.8909705521471;-77.4676337423311
