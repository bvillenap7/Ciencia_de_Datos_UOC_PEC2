Northern Virginia Brightest object in daylight sky moved faster then any object for 5 minutes, mulitple witnesses;2007-11-23 16:50:00;6 mintues;Northern Virginia Brightest object in daylight sky moved faster then any object for 5 minutes, mulitple witnesses I witnessed one object that appeared to be a plane entering dulles airport (shiny silver object) move far across the sky, then shine extremely bright. I asked if anyone else saw the object, then it disapeared, showed up higher in the sky and much much brighter, then instantly moved across the sky...i thought it was a plane circling, but planes passed it....It again shined beyond bright, we were scared that it was so bright and moving so fast. it whould shine bright and move across a portion of the sky without speed as a relation, it would almost appear in the same instand it left. I thought i was going crazy, but other people in the car saw it...we had to stop the car to affirm this, and it went on in the south west sky from route 28 and was the most amazing and undescribable thing i have ever witnessed. words can't describe what happened for 5 minutes ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

Bat sign craft;2012-07-23 09:45:00;10 minutes;Bat sign craft Hwy 50 Area:  Two black, soundless, vaporless and shaped like the bat sign  7/23/12:  I saw two of these crafts around 9:30am - 9:45am.  They were located to the south of Hwy 50.  I was watering my flowers when I looked up and saw these two crafts.  The one on the left, veers NNW and out of view.   The second craft glided NNW, then ultimatedly disappeared into the western skies.  As seemless and smooth as the flight pattern was, the second one did appear to struggle to level the craft momentarily.  I originally thought it was an unmanned droned being tested, but found nothing to suggest that there was any testing being conducted.  Also, most military testing is done in the over night hours as this is a very common event in my area. 7/26/12:  Approximately 7:15 PM - 7:25 PM   A work friend and I were talking and heading back into work from our lunch our when we I glanced up caught a very short visual of another bat sign craft going overhead.  I pointed it out to her right before it disappeared behind tree lines to the north. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Double fire lane falling from the sky.;2014-11-21 17:10:00;5 minutes;Double fire lane falling from the sky. While i was driving in the 28 in south direction, I saw in the sky two (2) vertical lines that looks like fire (red color) falling from the sky.  Was like see a double  tale of a meteorite.  I kept looking at it while I could because of the traffic jam, and after 5 minutes I had to keep driving, but was still there.;38.8909705521471;-77.4676337423311
