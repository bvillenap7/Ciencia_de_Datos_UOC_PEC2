Cylindrical object, approx. 10 feet in length, with undulating protrusions ,reflective area at its top, impervious  to head winds;2019-10-10 16:43:00;5 minutes;Cylindrical object, approx. 10 feet in length, with undulating protrusions ,reflective area at its top, impervious  to head winds On  10/10/2019 at  approximately 4:43 pm EST ,  I was at my place of work near Dulles IAD, when  I noticed an unidentified aerial object approximately  fifty feet above and passing slowly down the length  of  one of the secure buildings. From my  point of observation ,there was  no sound detected.  The object  appeared to be at least ten feet in length , and of a roughly cylindrical  shape.  At that point ,  I began taking photographs with my phone through the window of my building.  The object retained its rock steady vertical flight configuration for the duration of the sighting, and seemed to be impervious to head winds. Its flight path seemed under control and proceeded in a slow,graceful curving climb to the East against a head wind, where it levelled off and was  lost to my sight among some cloud cover.  Duration of the sighting was approximately five minutes.  The slow  speed of the object remained constant throughout the sighting.  Details of the object There was a brilliant light or reflective surface at the top of the object which remained constant throughout the sighting.One strange detail that I noticed while it was relatively low, were undulating  protrusions passing down its left side , which appeared to emerge from and return the the mass of the object.;38.8909705521471;-77.4676337423311
