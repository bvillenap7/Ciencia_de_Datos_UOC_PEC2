Bright light in sw sky;2019-02-08 03:00:00;~10 minutes;Bright light in sw sky Took my dog out to do his business and I noticed a bright rectangular object in the south west sky.  It was travelling away from us at a distance in an irregular pattern.  Over a few minutes it became a bright white light before lighting the horizon.  It was perfectly quiet, seemed large and a long ways away.;37.8931;-78.3386
