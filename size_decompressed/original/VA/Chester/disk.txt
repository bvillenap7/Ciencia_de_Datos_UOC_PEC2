My wife, Nancy, and I saw it at the same time about 10 minutes to 11 pm and it was approximately 200 yards from where we were sitting.  Nancy said she thought it might be an extremely low flying jet â€“ but there was no sound coming from it.  We live just south of Chester, Virginia, and the object was north of us.  I am wondering if anyone else happened to see this gold glowing object.  I have seen hundreds of meteorites and this object was much larger and moving somewhat slower - controlled (?).  It seemed to be descending towards Route not from where I-95 connects to Route to 10. Thanks for all of your work.
