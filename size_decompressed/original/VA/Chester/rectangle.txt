Rectangular Object In Virginia Sky;2001-08-28 20:43:00;1 minute;Rectangular Object In Virginia Sky Tonight at 8:43 EDT I observed a rectangular object traveling from east to west approximately 10 miles south of Richmond, Va. at approximately 10 to 20 thousand feet. The object was traveling at a speed that would equal, but not exceed that of a commercial airliner. What caught my attention was the fact that the object had atleast 10-12 white lights and 2 red rotating beacons located both fore and aft of the object. I happened to be looking at the moon at the time with a set of binoculars that I had just cleaned, so I was able to zero in on the object. Most commercial airline traffic that crosses this particular airspace does so in a south to north path at approx. 35,000 ft. Local air travel to the Chesterfield County Airport crosses my property from east to west, but does so at altitudes of approx. 500ft. on approach. Chesterfield handles small private aircratft as well as some business jets.;37.3419432203389;-77.3914228813557
Large square hovering object spotted over Virginia 12/8/18.;2018-12-08 20:00:00;2 minutes;Large square hovering object spotted over Virginia 12/8/18 1 large rectangular object hovering at approximately 2k-3k feet elevation.  It was dark outside so I was unable to see the color of the object I could easily make out the square shaped silhouette.  On the bottom of all four corners there were circular shaped white/silver lights.  There were a few lights along the vertical side wall around the corners (they were small and I was unable to determine the shape).  There were long horizontal linear lights in the center of each side.  These lights extended approximately half the distance of each side of the object  and stopped approximately 1/4 from each corner (they seem to be sort of centered on each side).  There were a couple other randomly located lights along the underside.  The object hovered for approx 45 seconds then rotated 180(+/-) degrees and slowly and smoothly moved away toward the SE.  During all of the movement it never appeared to change elevation,  or pitch.  It just appeared to pivot and glide.  The total amount of time that I had it in sight was approximately 3 minutes. Side note:  I was driving on my way home when I saw this object.  I was in mid conversation with my wife and subconsciously stopped in the middle of the road and  became fixated on this object.  I stepped out of my truck and just stared at it.  It was completely quiet.  Even during movement it did not produce a sound.  It was by far the largest object that I have ever seen in the sky.  The shape was unlike any plane, helicopter, etc. that I have ever seen.  My wife apparently kept asking what was wrong and all I could say was “hold on.  Wow that’s crazy...what the??”  Apparently I was so captivated by what I was seeing  that I  couldn’t put it into words.  After getting home I thought about calling the local police department and reporting it but did not do so for fear of any potential backlash.  I wish I could figure out what it was and hopefully provide some closure for myself.  I keep telling myself it’s probably something top secret military etc., and hopefully it is, but as of now I have been unable to find anything related to the military that looks like what I saw.  The closest object I found was something that some guy in North Carolina posted a picture of not too long ago.  The biggest difference is that the object in his picture looked rectangular and what I saw looked very square;37.3419432203389;-77.3914228813557
