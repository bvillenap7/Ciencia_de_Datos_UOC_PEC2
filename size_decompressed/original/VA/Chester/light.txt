My wife and her sister were with me but could not see the small white object probably due to a large tree branch hanging just above them.   At arm’s length, it was approximately one-fourth to one-fifth the size of a pencil eraser, and it was really bright.    After its sudden appearance, it stayed in one spot for five to six seconds, next – it moved to the left about 20 times it width, then, it moved to the right about 40 times its width.   About this time, I tried to get my wife and her sister to see the object – telling them that it looked like a really bright star, but they never saw it.   To get a better view, I got out of my chair and moved away from the over-hanging tree branch.  Just as suddenly as it appeared, it disappeared into the blue.  Total viewing time was 15 to 20 seconds.   What made this sighting a little bit weird was that a large jet airliner flew ! directly into the same area where the UFO had been less than a minute before bringing with it a long, wide contrail.;37.3419432203389;-77.3914228813557

It fell as if falling from an invisible opening in the sky... the night was a crystal clear night sky  so no clouds or precipitation to obstruct our view and the object was closer than any I have ever witnessed before. The way the object fell was too slow to be a meteor or falling star, also noting that there was no “light trail” following behind the object as it fell. We watched it fall for about 5 seconds before it disappeared into the dark night sky somewhere close to the earth surface.  It was the strangest light object ufo... I have encountered and felt a duty to report it.;37.3419432203389;-77.3914228813557
