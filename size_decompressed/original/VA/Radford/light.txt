High-altitude, fast, wiggling white light.;2020-07-13 23:00:00;2 minutes;High-altitude, fast, wiggling white light There was a bright white light (a little brighter than Venus), which appeared to be very high up but moving very quickly across the sky. I t was moving SSW to NNE, and took maybe two minutes to move from one horizon to the other.  It was moving in a generally straight line, but was wiggling or oscillating back and forth slightly as it flew (maybe 0.1 degrees amplitude, maybe one period per second).;37.1252585365854;-80.5468146341463
