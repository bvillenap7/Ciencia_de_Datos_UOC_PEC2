After a church softball game my son and I returned to our house in East Radford.  I went back outside to my vehicle after being inside for several minutes.  In the NW sky there were huge flashes of bluish green lights.  These lights seemed to originate from the ground and shoot upwards from there.  It was not a beam of light.  It reminded me of welding flashes, but magnified by hundreds of times.  It lit up the whole sky.   There are no houses, buildings, neighborhoods, or roads within 5 miles of my house and the direction of the lights.  It is just farm land over the ridge.  That is why I could not see what the object was that was producing the light, because of the ridge.  There was no sound and I never saw a craft or anything, however I was expecting for one to just shoot up.   It lasted for about a minute and a half and just as I pushed the record button for my camcorder it stopped.  Just wanted to share my story.  It was truly the craziest thing I have ev! er seen that I could not explain.;37.1252585365854;-80.5468146341463
