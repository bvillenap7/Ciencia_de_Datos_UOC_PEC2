One then another a short distance away. Both appeared to be a high altitude. While stargazing tonight I observed 11 satellites, 13 meteors and a high altitude formation of two military aircraft.  Their course was roughly 090 as hey were likely headed to NAS Oceana.  About five minutes later I noticed a bright but small flash south of the Jets course.   A moment later, there was another flash further along suggesting the object had traversed a great distance before flashing again suggesting the that the object had moved a good distance between flashes. I immediately thought it was odd and anticipated a third flash but it did not come.  I searched with my binoculars and could not find a source.  I thought perhaps they were flares from another jet perhaps associated with the formation I had just seen.  But there was no lingering burn descending to earth. I am a private pilot and well connected with DoD types as well as amature radio. By no means am I a sensationalist.  However, these flashes were an oddity in all my years associated with the sky.;37.0832;-78.9255
