A bright star-looking light that flew to the right super fast.  ((anonymous report));2017-06-10 20:32:00;6 seconds;A bright star-looking light that flew to the right super fast. Me and my two step-sisters were sitting on our back porch.  It was my older step-sister who suggested the idea.  After 30 minutes of sitting on the porch I looked up at the sky.  I saw a bright light (as bright as Jupiter) and I said, What is that?  The object looked exactly like a star, but it looked like it was dimming from a cloud (I couldn't tell because it was dark)   My younger step-sister asked, What is what? and she turned at the exact moment the star looking object took off in a flash.  It went right and all in the duration of 1 second leaving a light trail for less than a second.   I was freaked out and went star watching tonight but didn't spot anything there again.
