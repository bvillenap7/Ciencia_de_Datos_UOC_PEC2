I was thinking it is to big to be a planet  it must  be an aircraft when I saw it seemingly zig-zag.   So I stopped and put my finger up to see if I was imagining things and it seemed to be completely stationary  but looking at the sky every night I am sure this is not be a big orange planet but since it isn't moving it can't be an airplane.  Then,  it just vanished.  There was no noise  like to be a helicopter or flare or something closer.  Now, I was generally concerned but more so because about 3 months ago a teen was leaving our house and said he saw an orange light over our pasture zig-zag across the sky then disappear!! I din't give it much thought until last night.   I would like someone to tell me what exactly this was.;37.9636;-78.2535
