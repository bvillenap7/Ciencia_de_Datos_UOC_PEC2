3 erratically moving bright stars in large right triangle shape.;2014-07-29 01:30:00;>1 hour;3 erratically moving bright stars in large right triangle shape. My brother and I went to watch the Perseid Meteor Shower (we saw 4 meteors) at around 1:30 am and I noticed a rather bright star that was moving erratically in in small zigzags and backwards and forward at what seemed to be random.  A few minutes later I noticed another to the left of it about the distance of a ruler at arms length.  I then saw the third dot above the first about half the rulers length, they formed a large right triangle in the sky and all moved around erratically.  We watched them for about 25 minutes before going back inside.   At 2:34 (now) they're still out there.;36.8402;-76.7345
