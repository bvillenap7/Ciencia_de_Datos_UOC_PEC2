Exceptionally big and bright star/planet-like light briefly appears in SE sky, then vanishes, as though getting shut off.;2021-07-31 20:45:00;Only observed for a few m;Exceptionally big and bright star/planet-like light briefly appears in SE sky, then vanishes, as though getting shut off. My daughter and I were sitting in chairs by our vehicle outside in a parking lot at the Joel C. Bradshaw Fairgrounds, waiting for the 9:00 PM touring Drive-In Laser Light Show by Cabin Fever to begin. Just before 8:45 PM, prior to the beginning of the show, we were looking at the southeastern sky when what looked like an exceptionally large and bright whitish colored star or planet caught our attention. Almost no sooner than we noticed it, it disappeared from our sight, as though it were just shut off. As I began to wonder what I had just seen, I heard the group of people sitting next to me begin discussing the same sighting, trying to figure out what it was. I joined their discussion, and all of us agreed that it wasn't the ISS, a star, or a planet. Not knowing what it was, we could only think of it as a UFO. A few minutes later, my husband rejoined my daughter and I after using one of the porta-potties, which was across the street from the parking lot -- a sizable walking distance away. He said that he and a few others in line had also witnessed this unknown and interesting phenomenon. I am sure that many other people witnessed this unusual sighting as well, since it was visible at a large event with at least a couple thousand people in attendance.;36.8402;-76.7345
