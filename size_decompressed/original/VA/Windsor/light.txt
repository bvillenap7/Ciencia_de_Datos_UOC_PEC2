two lights shoot  from East to West  in Virginia;2008-01-23 19:30:00;10 seconds;two lights shoot  from East to West  in Virginia At approx. 7:30 pm on January 23, 2008 I was driving west on route 460 about 3 to 4 miles west of Windsor. I spotted what at first thought was 2 shooting stars. The lights bright white in color were equal distances apart which was very odd. Neither one went slower or faster than the other, but stayed at a constant speed parallel with each other. There was no spin or rotation to the object(s).  The object(s) went from East to West at a high rate of speed. There did seem to be a smoke trail from each of the lights. As the lights flew off into the western horizon they both disappeared. I have tried rationalizing what I saw, but with no results other than it was very high up, and if it was one object with two lights then it must have been massive. Too big to be a jet due to its altitude and size that I observed. My father whom was with me did not see the object he was looking elsewhere.;36.8402;-76.7345

My buddy said did you see that? I said yeah I saw a light less than 2 seconds ago over there (pointing to my right) the we both stood up and he saw it again WAY further to the left and he said it shot strait up and disappeared (I did not see because my vantage point was different) but I look for these things, I've never seen one before and I know what the ISS is and I track that at night. It wasn't the SpaceX new internet stuff they have put up. It wasn't a comet or a meteor I know what that is as well. We are out in the country so we are very fortunate to be able to see the sky without light pollution. This entire event we saw less than an hour ago took approximat! ely 5 seconds. Very VERY cool experience. If anyone in the Windsor area or Suffolk area of Virginia saw the same thing PLEASE report it to the database. I hope others saw what we saw.;36.8402;-76.7345
