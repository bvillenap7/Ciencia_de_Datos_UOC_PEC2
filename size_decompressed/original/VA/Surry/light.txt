Very Bright Stationary Light Seen Over Surry, Virginia.;2013-11-23 19:00:00;15 minutes;Very Bright Stationary Light Seen Over Surry, Virginia. My husband & I were driving home in James City County, VA, & noticed a VERY bright star-like light hovering in the directing of Surry, VA.  We observed it for approximately 15 minutes.  It was larger & lower than a star.  It hovered.  It looked like a really large, bright, low, star.  Some cloud cover occured & it disappeared.  We waited about 10-15 minutes for it to return but it did not.   We decided to drive up & down the Colonial Parkway to see if we could see it from that direction & we could not.  It was simply gone.   Never saw it before tonight.;37.126;-76.7651
