Appeared wet as if amphib. exited at moderate rate to west, banked south, ascended and accelerated at incomprehensible speed and morphed simply accelerated until it reached a vanishing state. gone from sight although its track was still visible.  thought take me if you want but i don't know nothing --- just a stupid working man. saw 100's of windows and everything but little green men looking out them.  no sound, no smell, no wind just complete power to go & come unnoticed.  no radar track at langeley??;37.0383789473685;-76.3630732456139
