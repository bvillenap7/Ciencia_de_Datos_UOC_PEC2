Two orange-red dots flying at very high altitude and exhibiting great speed and unusual manueverability.;1995-08-15 21:00:00;3-4 secs.;Two orange-red dots flying at very high altitude and exhibiting great speed and unusual manueverability. I am unsure of the exact time period when I observed these objects, but I believe it may have been around the time of the Hyakutake? comet event. I was standing on my back porch looking at a small area directly above when I observed 2 orange-red dots that in my best estimation were traveling several hundred yards or more apart and at great speed and altitude. Suddenly, one object turned toward the other object, and with amazing precision and speed came along side the other at now less than 50 yards away. Then they disappeared behind trees across the street from my house. I am now 34 years old and have been fascinated with aircraft(identified and unidentified)since I was about 8 years old. I am somewhat familiar with many commercial and military aircraft. I find myself compelled to look at them any time I happen to hear or see them in flight. In my judgement, these objects were easily at an altitude twice that of a commercial aircraft at cruising. I believe my perception of altitude was enhanced by my witnessing a meteor around 1987 while standing on the rooftop of a local 10 story building. The meteor's trajectory was virtually straight in from my vantage point. I was very fortunate to be in the right place and time to witness it from beginning to end. Furthermore, regarding the U.F.O.'s, what truly amazed me was the movement of the one object that veered closer to the other was that it didn't fall into a position slightly behind the one that stayed on a straight path. It seems as though it turned , accelerated and then matched speed again with the other all in less than 1 sec. over the previosly mentioned distance of separation. In my opinion, these were not f-15's from L.A.F.B. or any other aircraft from anywhere around the Hampton Roads area. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));37.0383789473685;-76.3630732456139
Daylight observation of strange shaped craft over interstate in populated area near local Air Force base.;2000-05-20 16:10:00;approx. 20 secs.;Daylight observation of strange shaped craft over interstate in populated area near local Air Force base. Driving to a movie yesterday evening..it was mostly cloudy. When we approached the Mercury Blvd. overpass on I-64N. I noticed a craft off to the left. I thought it was a pair of fighter craft in close formation as we were near the flight path of Langley Airforce base and sometimes two jets on approach blend into a strange shape. It became apparent that the object was not jets and not as far away as I first thought and it was a singular object, rather oblong and cylindrical or boxy with a smaller boxy protrusion about midway down the length off to our right. It was hard to determine how fast it was going as we were in a moving car, but it appeared to be floating as a balloon would. I would estimate the object was approximately 30-40 feet long and between 6-10 tall. It appeared to be dark gray and there were no lights on it at all that we could see. We were probably about 500 yards away at closest approach and it appeared to be about 100-150 feet up in the air.  There was a local police car stopped by the overpass and we later wondered if he has seen this as well and was taking a look at it.  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get a good look at the object and am primarily interested in if anyone else saw this and knew what it was...I've seen many a strange thing in the sky over the years but most if not all I could explain away after a short time. This object has me bamboozelled as to what it was.;37.0383789473685;-76.3630732456139
I saw a fleet of UFOs;2011-06-27 19:00:00;10 minutes;I saw a fleet of UFOs I would like to clarify a few things I forgot to mention in a report I filed yesterday, April 17, 2012.  The craft that I saw made no noise at all.  The craft moved at a very high rate of speed.  There were no contrails.  The many that I saw weren't in a line...they just kept coming out of nowhere and made a huge group but not a formative group.  The craft was not glowing and I saw no lights.  The appearance was oblong in shape and silver in color. I do apologize that I didn't include this information in my initial report.  I am thankful that I have somewhere to share this experience.;37.0383789473685;-76.3630732456139
