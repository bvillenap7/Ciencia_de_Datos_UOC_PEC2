There were a few clouds, but I could still see the bright outline of the moon's reflecting light at the lower left portion of the moon.  The light reflecting off of the moon was sufficiently bright that I could see the outline fo the moon very clearly.  All of a sudden, a very large black square shape, about 25% larger than the moon itself passed in front of the moon (horizontally, as if a shade had been drawn), totally eclipsing the moon.  It was not only black, but it also seemed to have somewhat of a sheen, and it was much blacker than any other part of the night sky.  At first I thought it might be clouds, except I've never seen a black square cloud, nor have I ever seen an aircraft that was square, or of that size.  Further, in order for it to have been a satellite, it would have to have been of tremendous size.  I have no idea of what I saw, and will not try to suggest any possiblilities.  Any feedback, or confirmations on what it was, or might have been would be appreciated.;37.0383789473685;-76.3630732456139
