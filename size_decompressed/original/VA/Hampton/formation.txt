Low flying triangular formation?  of silent blue lights in 1974 near Langley Va.;1973-06-15 22:00:00;1 to 2 minutes;Low flying triangular formation?  of silent blue lights in 1974 near Langley Va. It was 1973, about 10pm summertime. I was lying back on the hood of my car just looking up at the sky. I saw what was either 12 seperate objects or 1 big one. There were 12 blue lights in a triangular formation flying at about 3 times treetop level. There was no noise at all. I was sure that no one would ever believe me and was very exited when 2 guys came running up the street yelling Did you see that? They had been chasing it for several blocks. That should give you an idea of it's speed. It moved slowly away at a steady pace and headed directly towards Langley Air Force Base, which was only several miles away by air. Having grown up in the area, I knew what planes looked like in flight and usually paid them no mind. This was not any type of conventional aircraft. I tend to think it was only 1 craft with multiple lights as I could not see the stars between the lights. If it was multiple objects, they were no more than several feet in width. I had never seen anything like it before or since that night. I would love to know what it was and will never forget it. There was no mention of anyone else sighting it on the news or in the papers, although it must have been seen by many others. This was almost 30 years ago and to my knowledge there is still no aircraft that resembles it in any way. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));37.0383789473685;-76.3630732456139
Lit offset T formation over hampton;2012-02-26 22:45:00;about 5 min;Lit offset T formation over hampton On the night of February 26, 2012 I witnessed a formation of lights in the skies over Hampton Virginia.  I was standing on my deck facing north when I noticed a formation of dim lights traveling from east to west.  The formation was more of an offset T then a V and moved fairly slow.  There were approximately 12 lights that were not blinking.  As I watched the formation move across the sky one of the lights shifted from one side of the T to the other and back, it only did this once.  I called my 16 year old daughter outside and she watched the formation with me until it had passed out of sight.;37.0383789473685;-76.3630732456139
