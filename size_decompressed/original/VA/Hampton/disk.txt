Saw a silver disk in the sky approximately 1,000’ hovering motionless over a cargo ship in the Chesapeake bay. After about 10 seconds the craft disappeared without moving, just like as if someone turned off a lightbulb. It was there one moment and in front of my eyes I watched it fade away into nothing. Surreal experience, 100% sure it was not any sort of man made object that we know of. Clearly had the capability to cloak itself when it decides it’s necessary to do so.;37.0383789473685;-76.3630732456139
