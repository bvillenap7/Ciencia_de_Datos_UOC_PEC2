I seen 4 more of them, but in what seem to be some sort of formation.  These four objects where not as brightly lit and heading North. The second event lasted about 15sec.   This is my third time seeing strange lights in the sky.  I grew up on a military base and never seen anything they had that looked like that.;37.0383789473685;-76.3630732456139
