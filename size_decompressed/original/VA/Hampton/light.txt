Bright ball.Moved from N to S. Reported next day up and down the Eastern seaboard.;1974-07-15 20:00:00;5 seconds;Summary : Bright ball. Moved from N to S. Reported next day up and down the Eastern seaboard. I was taking photos in the park and someone said why don't you photograph that looked up and saw a bright ball moving from north to south was so surprised I didn't take a picture.  The siting was reported the next day as having been seen from New York to Florida.  This was not a military operation. News reports said no military contacted knew anything about it.  This was a long time ago, but I can still see the image as it occurred in my mind. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

A bright light in the sky almost directly over head seemed to be moving in an erratic pattern.;2003-07-26 23:30:00;30 mins.;A bright light in the sky almost directly over head seemed to be moving in an erratic pattern. At around 11:30 PM my wife, her brother and I walked out to the car and I happened to look up.  I noticed a bright light in the sky almost directly over head.  It seemed to be moving in an erratic pattern, sometimes drifting in a circular fashion and other times it would jump from one place to another.  The light changed color several times and at one point looked as though it split in two.  Also, at one point we all observed a bright green flash next to but not coming directly from the light. There were stars visible though the clouds behind the light and they stayed still as this object danced around. We watched it for about a half an hour and finally went back into the house.  I went out sometime later but by then a thin layer of clouds had moved in and I could not find it again. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that the first possibility to be ruled out would be a celestial body, either a star or planet.  However, we are not aware of any exceptionally bright star in the July night sky, that would be directly overhead at that hour.  We will try to check a star chart.

Orange Light in the North Sky;2004-08-27 22:30:00;5 seconds;Orange Light in the North Sky First I would like to say that I am not the type of person that thinks every light in the sky is a UFO. I was sitting out on my back patio at around 10:30pm and just looking up in the sky as I normally do at night, to check out the stars. I noticed a light in the North sky about halfway from the ground to zenith. I first saw it out of the corner of my eye and thought it was just a plane. When I turned to look at it I noticed it was not a plane at all. It was about the color and intensity of Mars was last year at its peak. It got brighter and brighter untill it was about the size of a small pea, stayed in one spot for 2 seconds, then it moved down the sky at about a 45 degree angle. It only moved about a foot in the sky and then disappeared without fading. It is totally clear here tonight. I said to myself what the hell was that? I don't think it was a meteor because it moved too slowly and I have seen some pretty good meteors in the past. Also I donâ€™t think it was a satellite. I am pretty good about pointing out satellites to my wife and daughter, and this was not like them. It definitely was pretty high up and I did not hear anything. I have noticed weird things in the sky before but this is the first time here in Virginia. I reported sightings on this sight in the past (Coverse, TX 9/10/03 and Randolph AFB 7/5/03) I have also seen some weird stuff when I used to live back home in Rochester, NY when I was in high school about 12 years ago.

After lowering the binoculars I was using on the moon, I glanced directly overhead and saw two quasi-pinpoint objects moving in not quite parallel directions from north to south.  The twin objects were about half-a-fist-at-arms-length apart.  They covered the angular distance from zenith to about 30-degrees above the horizon in about five to six seconds.  The objects disappeared behind a layer of high cirrus to the south.  The objects were not exactly spheres of light.  They had a bright-white central pinpoint of light surrounded by a thin faint white halo that seemed to scintillate just slightly.  The halos were probably less than half a pinky fingernail in diameter.  Couldn't get the 12X binocs on the objects quick enough to get a bead on them.  While I was watching the two objects pass overhead, they moved closer to one another and one changed course about ten degrees and veered away from the other after closest approach.  The objects were not travelling at the same speed.  The one that made the quick and abrupt course change seemed like it was playing catch up with the other.  It was just abeam its twin when it made the sudden course change and then accelerated slightly ahead of the one that maintained a more or less steady course and speed.  At first I thought these might be jets from Langley AFB which is less than three miles away, but the objects were entirely silent with no obvious conventional nav lights.  They behaved like no polar-orbiting satellites I've ever seen.  I watched the area of the sky into which the objects disappeared for quite some time hoping to see them return.  No luck.;37.0383789473685;-76.3630732456139
Dim, starlike object making increadible manuvers at a high rate of speed.;2009-02-08 20:00:00;3 min (approx.);Dim, starlike object making increadible manuvers at a high rate of speed. I have always been a sceptic, and have never seen anything that I could not rationally explain, but tonight is the first time I have ever seen something in the night sky that is beyond explanation.  Tonight is a very beautiful night and I always like to look up at the sky at night.  As I was looking up just a few minutes ago, I saw what seemed to be a satilite.  A small somewhat dim light moving overhead.  Then it changed speed to a much faster rate.  It slowed, and sped up a couple times, then my heart started racing when I saw it make really tight turns, circling and darting in different directions.  I cant explain what I saw other than the fact that the military has a craft that we dont know about, or there really is some intellegence out there with flight technology way beyond what we are capable of.;37.0383789473685;-76.3630732456139

Orange flickering light that makes changes in speed and direction and dissapears behind trees into water.;2015-07-11 23:00:00;1 minute;Orange flickering light that makes changes in speed and direction and dissapears behind trees into water. On my way home from dinner, my wife and I spotted a flickering orange light coming towards us, so I pulled my car off the road and hopped out for a look.   Instantly you could tell it wasn't man made.  First there was no sound, second the light seemed to be flickering as if on fire, then it hovered in one place before making erratic changes in direction before the light went out.   After the light went out you could still see a black shadow possible in the shape of a rectangle slowly descend behind the tree line.  It either went into the Chesepeake Bay or the Langley military base that is on the other side of the water.  It was too dark to tell distances properly.;37.0383789473685;-76.3630732456139
2 white dots in the eastern sky higher than 35k feet.;2015-07-25 18:42:00;25 minutes;2 white dots in the eastern sky higher than 35k feet. As my wife and I were in the pool, we were looking at the shapes of clouds.  This is wearing (sic.  when) I noticed two white dots about an inch apart.  They were not moving in a straight lines, and were moving independently.   We watched them move some and stop and eventually they moved about 10 inches across the sky and stopped again.  Eventually they gained altitude until disappearing.  No sound, no fuel clouds, and no lights.  Definitely not planes or jets.;37.0383789473685;-76.3630732456139

There were about 10-15 that were out in front leading the pack but the remaining lights were moving and following behind while intermingling quickly in a group.  It was the strangest thing in the sky I have ever seen.  It didn't resemble just one craft but a lot of little something's.
