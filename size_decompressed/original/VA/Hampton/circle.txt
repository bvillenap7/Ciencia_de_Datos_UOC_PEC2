Fast traveling bright circular light in Hampton skies 6-25-12;2012-06-25 21:15:00;3 minutes;Fast traveling bright circular light in Hampton skies 6-25-12 At approx. 915pm on 6/25/12 I was in my backyard picking up tree branches from the nights earlier storms.  I looked up in the sky for some reason and saw a bright light moving at a fast rate of speed.  The sky was black and there were stars shining but this light was different.  Almost white hot- and moving.  At first I thought maybe it was a plane or weather object but there were not flashing red or blue lights.  Then there was another slower moving less bright light going in the opposite direction of the first bright light.  I ran inside to get my father but when we stepped back out both lights were gone and only the regular stars were visible.  My father mentioned it could be the satellite station but to me it looked like a huge ball of white light traveling at a high rate of speed.  I am wondering if anyone else witnessed this event tonight? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));37.0383789473685;-76.3630732456139
