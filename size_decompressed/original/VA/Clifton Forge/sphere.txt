Two Golden Self-Luminous Spheres Fly in Formation;2011-09-16 05:30:00;10-15 seconds;Two Golden Self-Luminous Spheres Fly in Formation Was looking at a clear area of sky in the pre-dawn hours toward the northwest.  The sky was that beautiful deep blue-purple, barely lit, and the sun was not even close to coming up.  About 45 degrees off of vertical, a glowing golden ball with rays coming off of it like a diamond glinting in the sun appears and begins to fly/hover straight up at a slow pace.  Shortly thereafter, a second golden ball appeared where the first one did, and it looked exactly the same as the first one. It flew down and kind of fishhooked up, then accelerated to make a pilot/wingman formation with the first gold ball (who had risen quite a bit by now).   After catching up to he first ball, both balls curved slowly toward the west and then faded out completely, in a pilot/wingman echelon formation.  They covered about 10 degrees of sky and the whole thing lasted maybe 10-15 seconds, if that. Gave the distinct impression of two craft flying in from space, then flying back up into space.  No noise at all during the sighting, just the beautiful gold / molten color of the spheres of light, both with golden radial rays like a diamond's fire.  They were well above the mountain ridge lines at all times. I thought it could be ball lightning, but there were no clouds at all, and no weather of any kind.
