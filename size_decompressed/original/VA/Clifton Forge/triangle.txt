Black Triangle;2007-10-05 23:30:00;30 Seconds;Black Triangle We generally see 737 and 747 air traffic travelling east to west in the southern sky over the city, always easily identifiable as civilian air traffic. These planes always appear as two white winglights having an apparent separation of a couple of millimeters at arm's length, with red and/or green FAA flashers.  Last week at approximately 2300 on 05 October, my two teenage cousins and I saw a triangle shaped airplane flying VERY LOW in the sky. It was HUGE, having an apparent size of about a half-dollar or full silver dollar held at arms length. I immediately thought it was a civilian heavy aircraft in serious trouble, but it never gave signs of distress, so we waved, because we were sure the pilot should have been able to see us! It had a strange light pattern, three solid, bright white lights in a nearly equilateral triangle pattern, apparently two wingtip lights and a nose light, with a square formation of four dimmer fuselage lights immediatley behind the nose light in a perfect square box pattern. It also had one red and one green light, and at least one of those was flashing. It was definitely a jet aircraft because we could hear the quiet rumble of jet engines, but they seemed much quieter than they should have been for an airplane that sheer size and low altitude. Despite the size, I couldn't tell anything about the fuselage shape because there was no moon, and the fuselage lights didn't seem to reflect off of the plane at all (black paint?). It appeared in the north and flew approximately northeast to southwest slowly and steadily with no deviations in course and no contrail. We thought it was a stealth bomber. It was definitely an airplane of some kind, A HUGE airplane. My cousins seemed to think it was the neatest thing they'd seen in a while up in the country, and I agree!
