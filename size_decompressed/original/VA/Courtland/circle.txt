It could be in a range of two weeks or so from the date. This is what I saw.  I was sitting on the side steps at my house smoking a cigarette (tobacco).  And I looked up at the sky and I saw an object moving fast threw the sky at amazing speed.  The tail seemed to be on fire.  Not a long tail at al short but burning.  Well i thought it was an afterburner.  You know ex Navy here aircraft-carrier duty.  But the fire went out and through the dark I could see a circular object moving through the sky still at a fast rate of speed.  This thing was moving.  So i said don't get spooked out to myself and waited for sound of the turbines.  But guess what the sound never came.  So then I was spooked out.  I don't know why I waited this long to report it sorry. Oh yea this thing was'nt small either it was fairly big.  Well it scared the shit out of me.  Later!! Oh yea i ain't ((deleted--attempting to fool))  ya niether I know what i saw.;36.7225;-77.0783
