Bright flash of light similar to a close lightning strike.  When my eyes adjusted from the flash the object was gone and the trail faded fast.  No sound from an explosion.  At first I thought it might be a nuke and feared for the worse, but nothing happened afterwards, no sound, no wave, nothing.;37.4441;-77.0471
