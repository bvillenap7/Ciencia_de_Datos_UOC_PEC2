We were in the back yard and 17 orange fireball looking spheres went in sets if 3 with each set flying in a triangle formation came from the east and flew west.   A passanger plane went past them going at the opposite direction at the same altitude. We called the Shenandoah Valley Airport and they hadn't had any kind if plane leave the airport at that time so they didn't come from there.  They were completely silent and didn't break formation.   They disappeared to the west into the distant clouds.;38.263;-78.9766
