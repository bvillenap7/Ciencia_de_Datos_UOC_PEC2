The last showed up very bright and seemed as if it came from the ground and vanished. Was leaving work driving down Washington St.  By the library, and as I look up, I saw 3 orange balls sitting in 1 spot side by side.   At this point I slow my car completely down and they appear to vanish within the clouds.   As the 3 vanish I see another appear within the cloud and in seconds I see a 5th one that was extremely bright orange but it look as if it had came from the ground, and it was rising higher and higher.;37.2024268817204;-77.4407967741935
