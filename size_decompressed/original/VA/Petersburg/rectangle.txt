Large Black Rectangle with pulsing green light. possible time dilation.;2011-11-15 16:00:00;unknown;Large Black Rectangle with pulsing green light. possible time dilation. I was driving along going from colonial heights into petersburg one evening.  I noticed out of the corner of my eye in the top left hand side of the windshield a large, slow, black, and rectangular craft with a slow pulsing green light either the out lay was one large light in the center or four smaller one on each corner I cannot recall.  Of unknown altitude, size, or approximate knowledge of origin. I only really only know that when i try to remember the event it it very difficult and it feels as though that the event took entirely too long to occur.   I do believe that some type of time dilation was experienced.   Possible abduction but unknown.  No hypnotic regression attempted. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.
