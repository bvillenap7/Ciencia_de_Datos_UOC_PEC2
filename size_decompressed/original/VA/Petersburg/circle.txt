As I followed it, I noticed a black round object hovering in its flight path.  As the helicopter approached, the object disappeared.   About 30 seconds after the helicopter left, the object reappeared and flew in a NE direction.  The object was as high as the clouds and flew at what appeared to be the same rate as a commercial airliner.  I followed it until it left out of my view.;37.2024268817204;-77.4407967741935
