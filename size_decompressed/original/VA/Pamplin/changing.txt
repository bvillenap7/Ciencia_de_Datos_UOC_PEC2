Linear triangle shaped object observed in Pamplin, Va;2018-01-15 05:33:00;10 minutes;Linear triangle shaped object observed in Pamplin, Va On 1/15/2018, around 0533, I was standing on my back deck, observing the stars smoking a cigarette.  I noticed something that was brighter and seemed to be linear shaped.  It remained and appeared to have softly pulsing lights and a smaller light pulsating below and to the slight right of it. I watched it for some time and as I was looking it opened into what looked like a &lt shape.  Then after a few seconds it closed.  This occurred several times during my observation and it did not move from its location.  During the episodes of v-shaped change in formation.  A strange howling sound unlike any of the animals residing in my surrounding area was noted.  I could not readily identify it as I can the resident livestock and other animals that frequent my immediate rural area, as I live in the sticks. This went on during the latter portion of my observation and it alarmed me, mainly the howling so I woke my oldest son and rushed him to join me on the deck to see and hear this peculiar event.  After a few moments of him looking in the wrong and every other direction an airplane came across the sky left to right-heading in the direction of the object and I used the plane as a moving landmark to help him spot the object. He acknowledged it immediately when the plane and object were in a line - the plane directly above the object, then passing by. It did not change into V- shaped formation while he was observing, however it did remain linear and seemed higher and a bit farther away.  The howling had also stopped and he made a remark about an experiment gone and urged me to go inside before it began again.  We both at this time around 0545 went back in the house, him returning to bed and I making this statement.  I thank you for the opportunity to share this event it truly was enlightening.;37.2643;-78.649
