white light over Alexandria at night grew in intensity-took three pictures;1979-02-13 01:00:00;a few minutes;white light over Alexandria at night grew in intensity-took three pictures As near as I can tell from the position of the images on my roll of film, it was sometime soon after my daughter's birth (Feb. 12, 1979) - at the end of the roll are pictures I took on a visit to Colorado in March 1979, so it was sometime between February and March of 1979.  I had looked out our bedroom window towards the East, and saw an unusual light which appeared to be beyond the Masonic Temple, perhaps over the Potomac River, which we could see from our window about 3 miles away.  It grew in intensity as I watched it as can be seen in the three images. From one of the images it appears it could have been lighting up the foreground, that is, the trees next door, but I the exact position is hard to judge. I don't recall how the sighting ended or much else about it.  I took three pictures of it with my Nikon F2 - I had kept it loaded with film because I had been taking quite a few pictures of my newborn daughter.  My daughter had been born at home in a snow storm, and it snowed heavily that week she was born.  I remember it was a hazy night when this light appeared.  The Masonic Temple was lighted up as can be seen in the pictures.  Recently (2007) I was going through old pictures to digitize and came upon the images again.  If I can figure out how to, I will upload them here.  The sighting caught me at a time when I had a newborn child at home as was not getting all that much sleep, so how it affected me may not be relevant.  However, it did seem to enhance my feelings of well-being about existence at the time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

3 objects with a trail of smoke attached hovered together in the sky over the expressway;2003-12-30 16:45:00;15 min;3 objects with a trail of smoke attached hovered together in the sky over the expressway While on I-495 S. towards Richmond, VA, heading home from work, I sat in very slow traffic and observed what I thought was airplane smoke left behind in a very clear sky, a perfectly straight line. I was in so much traffic that I reached max. speed of approximately 5 mph every minute or so. This is when I noticed that the straight line I thought to be left in the sky by an airplane was instead attached to a light of some type moving slowly across the sky from east to west. This line of smoke remained intact with the craft. I then noticed 2 more traveling together across the sky. I believed them to be normal aircraft until they performed a strange maneuver in sync with one another. The sun was beginning to set and the line of smoke attached to the craft was becoming the color of the pink sky. The first object began to descend in a very slanted motion and the other two followed, one hanging back a bit further than the other. As the objects descended further, the slant they were on began to appear like they were taking a nosedive, then began somewhat of a hovering movement. These objects along with the smoke at their tail, which was now a very bright pink light as the sunset, appeared to stop descending. It's very difficult to explain, but somehow the trail of smoke that was attached as a tail was now above the objects, almost like the trail was a very bright light being shined out of the top of the craft, but it still resembled smoke of some kind. All 3 objects just sat there in the sky. This went on for the 15 or 20 minutes that I was stuck in traffic in that area. As I began to merge onto I-95 2 more lines of smoke began coming from west to east. I can not say what came of these objects, as they were out of my view as I entered I-95. However, this is the first of many observances over the past week since 12/30/03. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that the possibility of contrails would be the first item to be ruled out, before we could conclude that the objects were UFO's.  PD));38.792294789916;-77.0986383193274

Very bright white point of light in northern sky at dusk.;2004-07-30 20:15:00;25 min;Very bright white point of light in northern sky at dusk. Right at sunset, in a clear sky I saw a bright point of white light, brighter than Venus would appear right at dusk, about 15-20 degrees West of true north. It was sitting perfectly still. After 4-5 minutes I ran inside to get binoculars. When I returned it was still there overall it seemed to be very slowly drifting SSW. In binoculars it first looked like 2 points of white light right beside each other. Over the next 20 minutes or so it sometimes looked like one or 3 points clustered together, but usually  2. At about 20:40 i went in to reheat my supper which was getting cold. At 20:45 I went back out and it was gone. My sister was about 2 miles SW of my location at about 2035 and she saw it too, briefly.;38.792294789916;-77.0986383193274
Red and white lights sighted in Alexandria, VA.;2008-05-26 04:30:00;10 minutes;Red and white lights sighted in Alexandria, VA. At approximately 4:30AM EDT, I decided to have one last cigarette before going to bed, so I went outside to smoke.  Coming out of the front door of my unit at an apartment-converted-condominium building, the lawn was surrounded by the building in a box-like fashion, with an exception of the south side fully open where the parking lot was.  I walked toward the parking lot, into the opening, and to my right, I spotted a bright red light in the sky, above the trees.  I looked directly at it, and the red light softly throbbed, like a beacon light.  From my vantage point, to the left of the red light were three bright white lights flashing in a rapid succession.  The red light would lit up and fade, then three rapid white flashes from right to left, then back to the red light lighting up.  It’d repeat the process.  I could tell that they were lights on an object, but I could not see the shape of the object.  At first, I thought it must be an airplane or a helicopter, so I waited for it to come closer in hope of a better inspection of what it was. Then I realized that it wasn’t either flying towards me or going the opposite direction.  It just remained stationary with the lights throbbing and flashing.  I also realized that the lights were unusually bright: the red light was just too noticeable and the white flashes were sparkling bright – similar to a camera flash.  If it was moving, it was done at a barely noticeable pace.  So slow that I was unsure if it was moving or remaining stationary.  For the most part, it remained stationary.  It remained virtually motionless for 10 good long minutes.  Finally, it moved further from me until I could no longer see it due to the trees being in the way.  The way it moved, it moved very smoothly in a gliding motion.  There was no sign of the object turning as it moved away the lights remaining in their same positions.  I have never seen anything like this before.  I would like to find whether that was an UFO or something else that can be explained.;38.792294789916;-77.0986383193274
Most unusual fireworks display;2010-10-22 19:30:00;5 minutes;Most unusual fireworks display I was driving on the Springfiled Franconia Parkway (headed east) when I saw what I thought was a fireworks display just south of the parkway.  Maybe that is what I saw, but it was most unusual.  Four bright lights moved down from right to left like slowly falling stars.  They faded then reappeared.  They then moved horizontally to the north.  Then they seemed to stop.  Then I lost sight of them.  It was puzzling. My sister told me yesterday that there was supposed to be a comet visible this morning.  Maybe that is somehow related.;38.792294789916;-77.0986383193274

Orange Flickering Light Moving and Motionless near Washington, D.C.;2012-12-14 23:29:00;1 minute;Orange Flickering Light Moving and Motionless near Washington, D.C. Witnessed a bright orange light to the southeast, it had no blinking lights (like an airplane would), but flickered like a candle.  It appeared to be moving very slowly from  south to north, then slowed to an apparent stop about 30 seconds after first appearing.   It remained motionless in the sky for another 30 seconds, then quickly faded out.  Aircraft taking off from Reagan National Airport fly north to south in this part of the sky, but they're close enough to identify the airline and could not be mistaken for anything else the object observed appeared farther away (perhaps southeast of Washington), made no sound, and moved essentially toward the airport before stopping and fading away.   I'm also aware of the meteor shower--if this was a meteor it was travelling extraordinarily slowly (being visible for about a minute and appearing motionless for a time).   There was no trail.  It could have been an aerial flare.;38.792294789916;-77.0986383193274

I looked up at the moon and I pointed out the bright star next to the moon.  My wife and our friend looked up and saw the bright star. I continued to look at this bright star while my wife and friend continued their conversation.  Then the bright star started to move.  I told my wife and friend to look at what I thought was a star, that is now moving. We first observed this object slightly to the right of the moon.  It then started to move left and passed in front of the moon.  Once it passed the moon, it stopped for a few seconds and then continued its path slowly pass the moon until it just faded away.;38.792294789916;-77.0986383193274
Seven very, very bright, blinking lights quietly crossed the sky above us in almost a single-file line.;2017-07-14 21:40:00;6 minutes;Seven very, very bright, blinking lights quietly crossed the sky above us in almost a single-file line. Sitting with one other person on our balcony...looking east.  Partially cloudy sky that night. Other person points and says what is that?!!  I look up, seeing seven very bright lights, traveling in a nearly straight line, traveling in a north to south direction, at about a 50% angle from the horizon, above us. The lights were much brighter than the brightest star in the sky--perhaps 10 times or more brighter. My first reaction was one of being very startled and concerned.  This did not look like anything I had EVER seen in the sky before...and I was at first concerned it was something dangerous.  After it continued past us, I was less concerned, and just very curious at what it was. The lights did not make any sound that we could hear...and the night was overall quite quiet.  The lights continued on their path, coming in and out of the clouds in a southern direction, for about 6 minutes or so...as they faded out of view and into the clouds in the distance. Hard to get a good read on their altitude, but they were significantly higher than the relatively low clouds that night, and perhaps a fair bit higher.  If I had to guess, I would say 5,000 - 15,000 feet.  But again, I'm no expert at altitude distances. Unfortunately, both of our phones were charging in the other room, and by the time we thought to get pictures, the lights were out of sight. To describe the lights in more detail:  Seven (maybe 8) very bright, white lights, maybe 10 times brighter (or more) than the brightest star in the sky, traveling in a nearly straight-line formation across the sky.  They were traveling in a nearly single-file line, with a couple of the lights slightly out of line. The lights were very close together -- all 7 seven of the lights were approximately contained in the outline of my fist when my arm was completely outstretched.  They seemed to be traveling at the approximate speed of an airplane.  They were traveling at a constant speed.  They seemed to be either twinkling or blinking... not all at once, but at a constant rate...maybe every second or so.;38.792294789916;-77.0986383193274

Bright white star darting around between 150-160 degrees S-SE, before ascending away towards the Aquila constellation.;2019-07-26 22:57:00;24 minutes;Bright white star darting around between 150-160 degrees S-SE before ascending away towards the Aquila constellation. I had just backed our car into our parking spot. Although it was a crystal clear night, there was a lot of light pollution and only a few bright stars were visible. My husband got out of the car to walk to the mailboxes. I took the moment to look up at the sky and appreciate the view from our convertible before closing the roof. While looking up westward at the sky, I saw a very bright white ‘star’ move across the sky SE to S (about 5-6”) in my peripheral vision. There were no other visible stars in its vicinity, nor were there any aircraft. I slowly got out of the car without taking my eyes off the ‘star’ and turned to look up at it directly in its very high south position. It continued to move in random directions, not varying much between 160 degrees S and 150 degrees SE . I called for my husband to come over quickly, I pointed out the ‘star’ and asked him if he could see it moving, too. He said yes, and we stood watching the star dart around for about five minutes. Then we laid down on the sidewalk to stabilize ourselves to be sure it was the ‘star’ that was moving and not our bodies. We continued to watch it dart around for another 10 minutes or so. Although it did not waiver in its brightness until it seemed to move away, my husband also observed periodic white lights to the sides of the star. I did not see this detail. We didn’t try to take any photos or videos because we only had our iPhones with us. The movement seemed to start to slow down and the star seemed to move out further at 154 SE degrees towards the Aquila constellation. We got up and walked to our house and encountered our neighbors. We pointed out the moving star and they could both see it and its movements but it was getting harder for any of us to make it out. At 11:21 pm we went inside as the star was now too far away to discern from the light pollution. This morning, a knowledgeable friend did a quick check on a satellite tracking app for the evening of the 26th and the brightest thing during the time frame I cited was an ISS pass (a very bright magnitude -1.1), but that was at the opposite side of the sky and skirting the northern horizon from our area's vantage point.  The only satellite transiting Aquila at the time was a GPS sat on a polar orbit, which are very faint.;38.792294789916;-77.0986383193274
