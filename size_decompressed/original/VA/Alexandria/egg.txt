((HOAX??))  Unidentifyed circuler objects near shcool, one repoted witness.;2006-04-26 12:00:00;Recess;Unidentifyed circuler objects near shcool, one repoted witness I was at school on day during recess and on the swing set. I looked over to my left and I saw a pure white circular object hovering in the distance. It looked as if it was spinning and made no noise. It moved slowly a distance and then stopped. Next a blinding flash can from nowhere it lit up the shadows everywhere. When I looked back, it was gone. Another one came up from the tree tops and moved to the same location. And, just like the first one vanished in the same blinding flash. I stared at the object and as the flash set off I could faintly see a beam of light traveling upward from the object. I looked up and I saw a triangular shaped object hovering in the sky, pure white floating slowly in the sky. It went into a huge cloud and disappeared.  It did not make a blinding flash or noise.

Sitting out back smoking a cig saw 4 consecutive egg-shaped object moving east to west at around 700 ft. one behind another.  All bright amber colored.   No sound at a distant of perhaps 2 miles.   At the same time saw a passenger jet moving in opposite direction at much higher altitude.  Objects had no blinking navigation lights;38.792294789916;-77.0986383193274
4 craft seen, low altitude, bright orange;2015-11-12 04:30:00;20 seconds;4 craft seen, low altitude, bright orange. I was sitting out back smoking a cig, when I saw 3 objects flying in single-file formation at around 700 feet, and perhaps a mile away.  Speed was perhaps 6 mph headed from east to west.   After they went behind a treeline, a fourth came up as if trying to catch up with the first 3, same elevation.   They were egg-shaped and bright self lit orange with a speckled white in the center.   No sound was heard at the same time a commercial jet flew over in the opposite dirction at perhaps 10,000 feet.;38.792294789916;-77.0986383193274
