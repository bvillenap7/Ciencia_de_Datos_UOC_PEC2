((HOAX??))  Hat Shaped UFO.  ((anonymous));1982-07-13 23:00:00;5 minutes;Finished playing kickball with my friends in our court and noticed a silver object flying at house/roof top level thru Stonebridge Road.  Some how object saw me and turned left behind the homes to confront me.  I ran from the object until it cornered me behind the Bell's car.  The object hovered above me for one minute and raised its antenna.  It seemed the object was studying me, and I was scared!  It retracted its antenna and at the speed of light (I can only say) left for outer space.  The object was a silver shaped hat.  It was approximately 1 to 2 feet high.  It made no sounds as it flew thru the air.  No air was disturbed.  Finally, when it did leave, it made no sounds and did not disturb the air.  I did watch a show on UFO Hunters, on the History Channel, covering a UFO sighting in August 1982 in Brazil.  It was the same hat shaped UFO that attacked me that was playing with Brazil's air force.;38.792294789916;-77.0986383193274

Sky pretty dark for urban area.   Looking with 12x60 binoculars in the summer triangle for asterism called the coat hanger   I was looking up toward zenith. Then,  I saw an oval, dim, cloud-shaped object speeding  from north toward south across my field of vision. ( size in 12x60 Oberwerk binoculars was approx. 1/6 the diameter of my field).  This thing moved too quick - it was not familiar.  (I know how fast a satelite moves when viewed through binocs and this thing was moving 10x faster than any satellite!   In fact, a north-south satellite came a few minutes later and it was moving comparatively much slower than the oval cloud that preceded it.)  It's possible that the light source for the fast moving cloud may have been moonlight.  There was a moon just past first quarter to the east of the north south traverse of the object.  It's, as if,  a  translucent substance  with an oval or circular structure, passed above me and somehow refracted some moonlight ( or else had a dim light of its own). I continued to look at the summer triangle area with the 12x60 binocs but only saw a real satellite running its North-South traverse approx 2 minutes later.  I noted that the satelite had a characteristic drift towards the west whereas, the previous, suspicious  object cloud  ran a perfect straight line from North to South. at a speed that was easily 8 to 10 times faster.;38.792294789916;-77.0986383193274
