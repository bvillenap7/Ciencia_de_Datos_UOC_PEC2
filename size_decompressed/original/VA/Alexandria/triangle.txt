A large black triangle passed over our house and into the west at night.;2007-11-05 23:00:00;20 seconds;A large black triangle passed over our house and into the west at night. I was watching a movie in my living room at about 11pm on Monday, Nov. 5th when I noticed it had started to rain outside. We are in the middle  of a drought and I had not heard it was going to rain so I went to the  front door to look outside and see how hard it was coming down.   As I  approached the door I heard a strange noise that sounded like a low wooshing, almost like a high pressure fire hose off in the distance. I  opened the door and looked outside into the sky, immediately noticing a  large dark triangular shape above our courtyard.   The object was  approximately 500-700 feet off the ground, passing overhead slowly and looked as  large as a commercial airliner.  It was an equilateral triangle with bright  white lights (not blinking) at each corner, one fainter white light (also not blinking) just in back of the forward light and a bright red  blinking light in the center of the craft.   I watched in awe as it  cruised slowly west across Highway 395 and out of sight.  I saw it for perhaps 15 or 20 seconds.  I live less than 5 miles from the Pentagon and we have military helicopters flying over our house several times a day, but I have never seen anything like this.;38.792294789916;-77.0986383193274
Saw a triangular formation of lights in the sky.;2008-08-19 20:39:00;Seconds;Saw a triangular formation of lights in the sky. I was taking out the trash about an hour ago, and I glanced toward the sky. I saw three lights arranged in a triangle shape. Thin lights connected the three round lights. It sped across the sky faster than any plane I had ever seen. It left a kind of luminescent trail behind it that stayed in the sky for about minute before fading away. I tried to take a picture with my phone but I wasn't fast enough.  I like aviation and know a lot about planes and helicopter, especially military crafts, and this was like nothing I had seen before. It moved very fast and the lights were not blinking.;38.792294789916;-77.0986383193274
Triangular UFO moving swiftly and silently next to Washington DC;2012-03-18 21:45:00;30 seconds;Triangular UFO moving swiftly and silently next to Washington DC I was walking my dog down my street when in the night sky I noticed an aircraft that didn't look like anything familiar. There was a triangle with three bright yellow lights with flashing white lights between them.   live near washington dc which has many large airports and military bases near it so I was skeptical.  However this craft moved completely silently and appeared to be not that high up in the night sky.  I did see other recognizable planes in the sky that were making noise and did not look like this craft.  It was moving very quickly and I jogged to keep up with its position as it moved behind the houses on my street.  I eventually saw it a second time in a new location close to where I originally noticed it.;38.792294789916;-77.0986383193274
Very large triangle shaped object flew over my house very low and was silent as night.;2017-12-17 19:24:00;>1 minute;Very large triangle shaped object flew over my house very low and was silent as night. Planes often fly over my house very often, and very low.  But this was not a plane.  A huge triangle shaped craft flew over my house very low, maybe 500 feet, and made no noise what so ever.  It almost resembled a B-2 bomber, but it was way too big to be one of those.  It only had three lights which were all white and no red ones.  During the pass my cats started acting wierd and stared at it and started whimpering which freaked me out a lot.;38.792294789916;-77.0986383193274
Black Triangle UFO spotted at night over Woodrow Wilson bridge, following I-95 torwards Alexandria, VA.;2020-09-23 20:40:00;6 minutes;Black Triangle UFO spotted at night over Woodrow Wilson bridge, following I-95 torwards Alexandria, VA. I was coming from Maryland on I-495 at about 8:40PM or 20:40, heading towards the Virginia metro area to visit my sister. The sky wasn't completely dark yet, but it was pretty close. It was around the moment National Harbor came into my view that I noticed some strange lights over the center of the bridge.  Three small white lights seemed to be slowly following one another about 50-100 feet above the bridge, right below the landing path for Reagan National Airport. I actually thought two or more planes were about to crash in midair before I realized all the lights were apart of the same moving craft. Instead of going towards Reagan to land, it drifted lazily from one side of the bridge to the other, and eventually began heading towards the VA end of the bridge following I-95, same direction I was going. I actually got pretty close to it (not right under it, but pretty darn close), and could make out a dark triangular silhouette above the bridges street lamps. The craft had a light on each vertex/tip and was about the same size as two SUVs side by side.  It was around this time my sister called me to get an ETA, that's how I'm still able to timestamp this whole thing. I explain to her what I'm seeing and stay on the phone until I eventually lose sight of the craft around 8:46PM or 20:46 when it seems to take an interest in a different road along I-95 and I pass it. I was too busy driving to get a picture.  Other Details: The Triangle (|&gt) moved base first (|) with it's third vertex tailing behind it (&gt). I couldn't see any features like helicopter blades, airplane wings, or a cabin/fuselage. I rolled down my window and couldn't hear any aircraft engines either. At one point the front base lifted as the craft gained some altitude (a meter or two maybe) and the back vertex dipped down before leveling out with the front, giving me a partial view of the top of the craft and an idea about its dimensions, and it almost seemed flat. Average speed I followed at was 60-70MPH, but the craft was going way slower when I first spotted it. Not to mention, it was in some pretty strict airspace with Reagan, Andrews, and D.C. all right there. Not sure what kind of pilot would have the jurisdiction to fly the way this thing did in such a sensitive area.  2020 was weird.;38.792294789916;-77.0986383193274
