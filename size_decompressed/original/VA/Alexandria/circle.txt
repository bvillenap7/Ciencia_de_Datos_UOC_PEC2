When I looked up there was a greenish-blueish, round, glowing orb whizing through the air at an incredible speed. The speed alone canceled out the possibility of a jet, not to mention that there was absolutely no sound involved. At first, I thought that maybe it was a comet fragment, but I quickly ruled that out, as there was no streak, and also because it didn't move in a straight path it zig zaged. Comets don't zig zag. It didnt stay for long, and was almost immediately gone. I don't know how long it was visible for, only that i didn't see it until it was leaving the area. I was urgently trying to get the driver's attention to have her get a look at the craft, but by the time she actually lifted her eyes off the road, the strangely colored light had vanished.....  I found it interesting to note that that same day a friend of mine had seen another in the air at a different time, and another group of friends saw many in Tennessee, including a large lenticular cloud with glowing orbs surrounding it, that following weekend. I have the pictures they took and will develope them as soon as possible. One more thing: there was a mysterious helicopter which seemed to be trailing in the direction of the ufo I saw as described above. Fort Belvoir is quite close to the sighting location.;38.792294789916;-77.0986383193274

It had a greenish glow to it and streaked across the sky. I live close to several Major Airports <Regean National>, but this was definately no plane. This is not the 2nd objet that i've seen in the area in the past 3 months or so.;38.792294789916;-77.0986383193274
Moving bright light, March 9, 2004, 7:57 PM, Alexandria Va.;2004-03-09 19:57:00;<1 minute;Moving bright light, March 9, 2004, 7:57 PM, Alexandria Va. Very large, very bright white object moving fast below the cloud line.   Observed from position 2 miles south and east of the Pentagon.  Definitely not a jet or helicopter or their landing/spotting lights.  Location is near (1 mile) National Airport but is not in the normal approach.  No sounds.  Object moved in a straight descending path from about 45 degrees above the horizon until it vanished behind the tree line.  Am familiar with the appearance of the planets and NGC objects.  This was different.  I have also seen satellites using a small Astro telescope (Celestron C90) under low power.  This was not a satellite.  Possibly a very large meteor but I've seen lots of these and this was much brighter than any meteor I've seen.  (Seems to be problem with dates above. Event happened March 9, 2004.);38.792294789916;-77.0986383193274
Two tranclucent cirlces float over D.C.;2007-03-25 10:45:00;30-45 seconds;Two tranclucent cirlces float over D.C. I was locking the front door of the house with the family already waiting in the car. I heard the low droning overhead of a large aircraft   I looked up to see what type of plane it was.  It was a C130 between 5000 - 7500' altitude heading West on climb out having departed from Andrews Air Force Base just across the Potomac River in Maryland.  Nothing unusual, but then I noticed above the C130, at a higher altitude, around 30,000' two translucent white round objects on a North East heading.  I would never noticed these objects had I not looked up at the C130.  They actually intersected the path of the C130 at the moment I was looking, with the objects being higher up than the plane.  As the plane continued on its western heading the two objects continued North East over D.C. and out of sight.  The first object seemed to move steadily on its course.  The second object seemed to be several hundred feet behind and moved in a manner as that of a child lagging behind a parent and not moving directly straight ahead, still keeping pace with the first object.  The two objects appeared to be as large or larger than a commercial airliner and left no contrails.  While I was watching this, a military jet at a much higher altitude 50,000'+ was heading in the opposite direction of South West.  I used the military jet as a comparison in determining the size of the two circular objects.  All craft just continued on their way without interuption.  The sky was clear as a bell with visibility near unlimited. Winds were about 10 mph out of the South.;38.792294789916;-77.0986383193274
