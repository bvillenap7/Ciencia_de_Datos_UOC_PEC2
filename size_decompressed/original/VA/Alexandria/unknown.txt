6-8  Bright lights, in a line. Moving slowly north. Over or near Old Town Alexandria/Potomac River.;2003-11-05 19:00:00;few seconds;6-8  Bright lights, in a line. Moving slowly north. Over or near Old Town Alexandria/Potomac River. I was stopped at a light facing east. It was dark, and there was an overcast. While looking up at the traffic light, I noticed a series of white lights (maybe yellow). Maybe 6 or 8 in a tight line. They were heading north/northeast. Between the overcast and the distance, it was to difficult to make out a distinct shape. If I had to guess, I would say that it was cigar shaped.  I've lived in the area for a couple of years. I've seen 100's of airplanes take off and land at Regan National Airport. Airplanes are pretty easily recognizable at the elevation you see them coming and going from an airport only a few miles away.  It was extraodinarily large, and moving slow.  Coincidentally (or not) as the object moved out of sight, sirens begun blaring and in the intersection behind me I could see (through my rear view) a couple of black Surburbans (tinted with the dashboard police lights) fly through the intersection. They were escorted by a couple of city police. They too were heading north. That in itself isn't too alarming. I also worked in D.C. for a couple of years a grew accustomed to the Secret Service/FBI (whoever) Surburbans speeding all over the place. But in Alexandria, escorted by police, it seemed a little out of place. I would urge anyone reading this, who might have seen the same thing to file a report.;38.792294789916;-77.0986383193274
Object turning from bluish-white to yellow-orange seen crossing nighttime sky in Fairfax County, VA.;2013-03-22 19:53:00;2-3 seconds;Object turning from bluish-white to yellow-orange seen crossing nighttime sky in Fairfax County, VA SUBJECT:  Unidentified Flying Object  I’m located in Northern Virginia, just below the I-495/95 beltway, on the south side of Washington, DC. I was seated in my van, facing approximately NNE, at approximately 8:53 PM, Friday, 23 March 2013. The air was lit up to the left (and West) of me by the stadium lights at the nearby Hayfield High School. As I was backing up in my parking space (at the curb in front of my house) in order to clear another vehicle parked immediately in front of me, some movement in the sky to my upper left front caught my attention.  Something was moving across the sky low, from West to East, but not particularly fast. Suddenly, it turned yellow-orange and then disappeared down behind the trees (and house) to my right front. I think it was flaming out as it disappeared, but I’m not 100% positive!  It was visible for a few seconds, although it seemed longer at the time!  PARTICULARS  I was facing N 47 degrees, 06 minutes 15 seconds E (according to my house plat!)  I was looking up at approximately 10 degrees (from horizontal) at the center of my field of view (FOV). I noticed the object at 30 degrees to the left of center line of FOV. I lost the object at 35 degrees to the right of center line of FOV. Trajectory was fairly straight, at angle of 3 to 4 degrees to my horizontal, up on left to down on right. Trees in front on me were about 480 feet away, at right angle to centerline of my FOV.  The house behind which I lost sight of object is about 145 feet away (2-story, split entry model). Time was approximately 8:53 PM. NOTEs:  I got into my van as I was heading to local 7-11 store to purchase lottery entries (Mega Millions and PowerBall), which I do at about the same time every Tuesday and Friday evening. When a police officer came to the neighborhood at approx 8:11 PM and we were IDing the time of my observation, he said his Sergeant had sent out a message at 8:54PM to all officers alerting them to be on the lookout for anything unusual. I had reported the sighting, but because of the altitude, color and speed I thought it was something local (i.e., something other than a meteor) because all I had ever observed were shooting stars and meteorite showers!  I offered to the police that I thought it might have come down not to distant from me!  Therefore, we didn’t want to rule out possibility that it was a nearby event!  Later on 10 PM news (local FOX, Channel 5) they reported that there had been a meteor event, seen from North Carolina to New England, and someone had report seeing it from Frederick, Maryland. The news added that it was not unusual for observers to think meteors in the atmosphere are than they actually are, but meteors usually stop glowing before reaching 5 miles high because they have slowed so much by then. This morning, on the NBC news (local Channel 4), they showed a still B&W photo from Maryland and reported that it had been seen from Florida to New England and the colors were bluish and greenish to bright orange in Maryland. I concluded that I picked up the object as it was slowing from higher speed (whitish-bluish) and turning to yellow-orange.  So the observer in Frederick, MD area and I were likely seeing the same thing. I think the news gave the time as being around 8 PM. I served 23 years in U.S. Army and have now worked 24+ years as Defense Contractor (hold high security clearance.;38.792294789916;-77.0986383193274
Flashing lights from a craft in an irregular patten, sometimes retracting to other areas, in Alexandria, VA;2017-09-05 01:24:00;5 minutes;Flashing lights from a craft in an irregular patten, sometimes retracting to other areas, in Alexandria, VA I was just laying in bed on my phone, when I was alerted by bright flashing lights in the sky.  I have lived in the DC area for a long time, and know the behavior and appearances of planes and other craft in the area.  I have also lived in military towns and this event was shocking to me.  Facing southwest from my apartment window, I saw flashes from an unknown craft in the sky of white-yellow light.  The light blinked quickly and unlike crafts on earth the flashes seemed to have no regular pattern.  At times the flashes would refract momentarily to a distance away (perhaps a mile or so- it's hard to know how far away this craft(s) was) and then blink back to the origin area.   This went on for about 5 minutes and then suddenly the light stopped flashing.  I have never witnessed a UFO in my life and found this event shocking in its irregularity.;38.792294789916;-77.0986383193274
