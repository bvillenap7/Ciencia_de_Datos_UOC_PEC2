Today 8 March, a clear night in Alexandria, what appeared to be a craft of some sort had over 100 individual lights that appeard to be stars under it.  The lights did not blink.  The craft appeared to be only stars initially but as it moved the outline appeared to be a gigantic wing except it was rectangular.  It appeared to have the shape of a large single winged craft.  As the craft moved toward the moon it completely disappeared as if it was cloaked it could not see it as it went toward the moon.  The craft moved slowly from the west to the east on a clear night.  It appeared to be huge compared to the usual normal aircraft I see at night flying overhead.  However, none of these lights blinked.  It was something other than the usual craft I am very accustom.  Some one else had to see this, please correlate my description with others.  It was real as I donâ€™t look for these. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.
