Round disc flying above 100 yards and approximately 25 mph with a green flashing light.;2020-08-16 22:00:00;1 minute;Round disc flying above 100 yards and approximately 25 mph with a green flashing light. At approximately 2200 hours, I was outside taking my dog to use the bathroom.  As I walked outside I heard, what I thought to be an extremely low flying airplane.  As I looked up the object was approximately 100 yards above and was flying at approximately 25 mph.  It was not rotating, and appeared to be a disc, with windows and a blinking green light.;38.792294789916;-77.0986383193274
