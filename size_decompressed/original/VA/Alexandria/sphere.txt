It dropped vertical and made a 90 * Walking through a farmer's market stationed in the Kingstowne Towne Center's lot, I find myself looking up at the bright blue sky at a small silhouette of what I thought was an aircraft flying towards my direction. Facing south/east, I noticed a small, dark dot in front of a white cloud, and I tried focusing on it suddenly it dropped down vertically, at a high rate (but controlled) speed, than it made a right angle turn to the right and faded away. I observed this stationaried object for about 10 seconds, the vertical drop and 90 degrees turn took about 4 seconds. Temperature was 78 degrees.;38.792294789916;-77.0986383193274

As the mall sits on top of a hill, the view is wide open.  I was looking out the bus window when I saw what appeared to be a charcoal-gray metallic sphere floating in the air maybe 1,000 feet up. There were no apparent window, or lights, nor any sound.  I thought at first it was a balloon--but soon realized that it had neither a basket underneath, nor was it moving at all...It was absolutely motionless.  I was able to observe it as the bus traveled down the road until it took an exit.  At that point we moved down hill and the view was hidden behind trees and buildings.  I am curious if others in the Alexandria, Virginia area observed this.;38.792294789916;-77.0986383193274
Bright white lights hovering over Potomac River near Washington DC and Alexandria VA.;2013-07-25 21:00:00;5 minutes;This is not the only or first time my friends and I (and many, many others) have seen these lights. Bright white lights hovering over Potomac River near Washington DC and Alexandria VA. (including Reagan National Airport)that are clearly NOT Earth based aircraft.  We have had many sightings in the last few months with one to three lights in loose formation.  On at least one occasion, military type helicopters (we think Blackhawks) have been scrambled in conjunction with the lights.;38.792294789916;-77.0986383193274

My wife alerted me to the sighting and called me to come out of the house to see it.  She was very enthusiastic about it and exclaimed “Isn’t it neat!”   The orbs were approximately 1000 feet above ground level, moving fast (more than a hundred plus miles per hour, I estimate) and mostly stayed together in a series of loose formations, yet there were some lone “stragglers” that would come along after groupings of 5 or 10 had moved along together.   They were luminous, but perhaps not self-luminous, as they may have been reflecting light from the setting sun.  The orbs also appeared to be “pulsing” light.   We live within about 4 miles of Reagan National Airport and the Pentagon so, the direction they were traveling would seem to have taken them near, slightly south, of both locations.   I took a short video of the sighting with my iPhone.   We have not seen in the news media or heard of any reports to explain what the orbs were.;38.792294789916;-77.0986383193274
