On the evening of September 15th my twin sister, 16 year old nephew and I were sitting on the deck eating dinner. We looked up and saw a bright light that did not move. My nephew said it was a helicopter but I said it was stagnant and not moving. Then there was a big bright burst and it collapsed into itself and disappeared, just like a hyper speed scene in a science fiction movie. We all looked at each other and said, What did we just see?  A few seconds later we saw it again in the exact same place in the sky! I ran into the house to get my husband, 8 year old son, 12 year old daughter and 13 year old niece. We all stood watching it in disbelief. My daughter took a picture and video of it with her iphone 11. Then it disappeared again. I sat outside for another hour watching the same spot in the sky but it never reappeared.  My twin sister and I are both Federal Officers and I also work for an airline at the airport.  We have sat on our deck almost every night for 6 years at our house. It has a beautiful view of the George Washington Masonic Temple. We live in close proximity to the White House, so a drone flies over our house every 20 minutes, it has red lights on it. A prison is also near our house so we see many helicopters fly over our house with search lights. We are very familiar with how airplanes, helicopters and drones look.  They are always moving, not stagnant and they all have red lights on them.  So, that is why we took notice of the bright burst of light that was just suspended in the air with no movement. It was amazing, not scary but still makes you aware of how small we are on this earth. I don't know what it was, but with 7 other people who saw it, it had to be something unexplainable.;38.792294789916;-77.0986383193274
