We were all on a back deck of a townhome in Broadlands/Ashburn during a Mothers Day cookout.  Sun had set about an hour earlier.  There is a row of townhomes about 12 long, and we are second from end.  We overlook an undeveloped lot which could easily fit two football fields and it is owned by blue collar contractors or landscapers.  There are a few shacks on the lot, occupied, and lots of trucks.  No lights in this lot or for miles off the back deck and during day you can see clear to Shenandoahs because we are situated at the top of a hill.  We had one light on, and candles and no neighbors were out back or had lights on. An object flew quickly over everyone at one point which I didn’t see, and I came out of house and joked that it must have been a bat.  My sister pointed at a white light in the distance and it looked like a plane approaching Dulles Airport.  But it wasn’t approaching, just staying still.  The light turned red or green and the object starte! d moving again.  There was no sound we could detect but it continued to change colors every 30 or 40 seconds and fly in the area off the back deck, staying a good 1,000 feet or more away and then moving but staying within range of this back row of townhomes most of the time.  Flew over us once or twice and circled back and the colors were always either white, red, or green.  This continued for almost 15 minutes and we got nervous that someone was videotaping.  We stopped watching it though and it went away.  No pulsating light or noise, just solid light, hovering, and fast movement.;39.0127;-77.5342
