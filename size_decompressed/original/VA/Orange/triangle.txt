About 4 miles from the town of Orange, we both noticed a triangular shaped craft flying over Route 15, coming from the east and traveling west.  The view of the craft was subtle, as there were no lights illuminating the underside of the craft except for 3 dim blue lights at each angle.   We both could discern a  vague outline of a solid object and the angle appeared to be equilateral in shape.  Though we were inside a vehicle, we could not detect any sound and it was traveling at a high rate of speed.  After it passed overhead, it seemed to blend in with the darkening sky to our west.  Since this seemed so unusual, we both noted the time, which was 7:18 PM.;38.2197;-78.05
