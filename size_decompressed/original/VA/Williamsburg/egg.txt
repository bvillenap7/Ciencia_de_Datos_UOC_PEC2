Bright light object with three clusters of light.;2014-12-11 00:00:00;10 minutes;bright light object with three clusters of light I have heard people talk about UFO's, and I have never believed until now.   I was driving home from work.  The road I travel is extremely dark and there is no street lights.  I was the only car driving.  1 car passed me and that was it.   I noticed an oval/egg shape object in the sky beside my car.  I rolled the window down thinking maybe it was an airplane.  I drove home in silence, so when I did not hear sound, I rode my window down further.   The object started getting lower and lower and to my right was water.  I got a real good look at it.  I noticed it was three clusters of light.  The light was so bright I couldn't see the color of the actual craft.   I became extremely afraid because I knew at this point, it saw me.  It then stood still and started to hover my car.   At this point, I drove extremely fast to get home because I was the only car on the road.  The water stood still the whole time this object hovered over it before it came over my car.   I now know we are not alone on this earth.   There are no airplanes with three clusters of light.;37.2930092198582;-76.7424794326241
