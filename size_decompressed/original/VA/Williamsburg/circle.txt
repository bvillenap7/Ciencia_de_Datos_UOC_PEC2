Light which released multiple yellow orbs which returned to craft (light) near Williamsburg VA 1980s;1983-06-30 01:00:00;10 minutes;Light which released multiple yellow orbs which returned to craft (light) near Williamsburg VA 1980s I was camping in the summer either in 1982, 83, or 84 near Williamsburg, Va.  I was sitting in the drivers seat of our van while my family slept in the tent.  I saw a bright yellow light about 3 feet in diameter appear above the creek that the campground was on. It immediately began zig-zagging through the trees in the campground and came within 10 feet of the front of my van. It went deeper inland until I couldn't see it.  A much larger glowing circular light then appeared very high in the sky. (It may have been there all along and I didn't notice it until I saw the smaller orb). I saw 4-5 yellow lights come out of the larger light and descend into different areas.  The large light remained in the sky.  About 5 minutes passed, and the smaller light that passed me came back out of the forest and back over the water. It then rapidly accelerated and went into the larger light.  Simultaneously, the other smaller lights ascended and were absorbed into the larger light! like the one I saw close up.  About 3-5 seconds later, the larger light simply looked like it blinked out. It did not appear to take off at a high speed it just blinked out.;37.2930092198582;-76.7424794326241
Flying circle over Williamsburg, VA.;2017-07-11 23:15:00;10 seconds;Flying circle over Williamsburg, VA. Driving home from a friend's house, saw a circle which resembled what looked like a street light fly through the sky in an eastern direction.  It was really quick, much quicker than any other flying craft I have ever seen but still very close because it was so large.  Only lasted a few seconds.;37.2930092198582;-76.7424794326241

I saw an orange light/streak very quickly go straight down until it went behind trees.  It was very quick only a second.
