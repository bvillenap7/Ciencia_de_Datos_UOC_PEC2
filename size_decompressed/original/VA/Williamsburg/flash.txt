I was driving northbound on Rt. 199 in James City County.  And somewhere between the Monticello exit and the Longhill Road exit,, I looked out at the western sky, not very high above the tree line, and saw an object burning as it was flying and falling slightly in the sky. It was being incinerated in bright white and light greenish flames.  It was like perhaps a satellite falling and burning or a part of an aircraft or something.  But this was a lot larger and closer to the earth. Was it a drone that had hit power lines?  I don’t know what it was.  But I was concerned that whatever had burned out might have fallen on a house or hurt someone. So I called the Virginia State Police on my cellphone.  The emergency operator was nice but sounded dubious about my report.  So then I called the James City County police.  That operator took my report and said they would send an officer to the area to investigate. Less than a minute after I hung up with the county 911 operator, a police officer called me, saying my call had been routed to him.  But when I explained what I had seen and from where, he said he was located in the lower part of the county and wasn’t patrolling the area near my sighting. I didn’t hear from any other officers.;37.2930092198582;-76.7424794326241

The flash of whatever this was flitted across the night sky from west to northeast.  It went faster than anything I’d ever seen before and flashed about five times.  The light of each rapidly progressing flash was pencil thin but very bright.;37.2930092198582;-76.7424794326241
