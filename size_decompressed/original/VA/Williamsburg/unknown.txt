I was driving off of 199 onto the longhill road exit when I suddenly saw a mostly bright green and white object that was not decending like a airplane or helicopter, it hopped into two distinct arcs. The first arc was short, and the second was long then it disapeared into the dark sky. It was about 70 degrees above the horizon. If a shooting star was a ball point ink pen line, this looked more like a large magic marker for size comparison.;37.2930092198582;-76.7424794326241
Red, blue, and white silent hovering object over treeline.;2016-08-28 20:45:00;20 minutes;Red,Blue,and White silent hovering object over treeline Saw red and blue lighted craft flying low over treeline.  Craft stopped, dropped down,then resumed.  This happened numerous times.  It would hover,drop, glide all without a sound. The red light would move from one side to the other at times and there was a white light intermittently as well.  Item too big to be a drone, no sound, weird lights and movement not consistent with any aircraft or helicopter.  I have a video file.;37.2930092198582;-76.7424794326241
