Silent V-shaped aircraft slowly glided over Williamsburg, VA, then disappeared instantly.;2002-11-01 21:45:00;10 seconds;Silent V-shaped aircraft slowly glided over Williamsburg, VA, then disappeared instantly. My friend and I glanced up in the night sky at what we thought was a flock of geese in V formation. But it was lights on an aircraft gliding slowly and silently to the southeast.  One side of the V was shorter than the other.  I think there were about 7 pale yellow lights on one side, about 5 on the other.  The lights appeared oblong, not circular.  Our line of sight was obscured as it moved behind a lone tree, but then it didn't come out from behind the tree. It disappeared. No sound. I've only seen photos of Stealth Bombers from above--do they have lights like this?  Are Stealth Bombers silent?  We are located close to Camp Peary and other military bases.
