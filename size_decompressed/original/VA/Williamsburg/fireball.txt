At 17:12 local, I saw what appeared to be an object on fire moving rapidly from left to right (East to West) as we viewed it.  I asked my Son, Are you seeing this?  He replied, Yes...that's cool!!   It took 4 seconds to traverse our view, and then was obscured by the trees lining the road.  It was cold looking up front, bluish/white in color and as you looked aft, the tail seemed to be much hotter or on fire.  A yellow/orange color like fire or an object burning up in the atmosphere.   I estimated it to be about 30 degrees elevation from our view in the car and would estimate its declining altitude to be 300-500 AGL, when we viewed it.   We saw no impact due to the trees obscuring our view and heard no sirens or emergency vehicles once we reached the house.  Figured if it were a meteor, it would impact and get people's attention?;37.2930092198582;-76.7424794326241
