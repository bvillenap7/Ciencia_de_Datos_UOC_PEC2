All of a sudden this purple light went across the sky, its was slow at firs Me and my friend had snuck outside to play ding dong ditch. When we were out there we did about 5 house and then on the 6th one we hid behind a van, we heard the door open and we stayed quite. All of a sudden this purple light went across the sky, its was slow at first and then got faster and faster then dissapeared. another thing about it was it left a tail like a comet but the tail was just as bright as the air craft that it followed, but right when the ship dissapeared so did it.

A light flying really fast and really low;2002-06-23 22:13:00;less than 2 seconds;A light flying really fast and really low I was at Busch Gardens, crossing the railroad between Italy and Scotland. I looked up and saw a blinking light that was moving really fast. It took less than 2 seconds for the object to go from one end of the sky to the other. And i also noticed that the object was flying low, compared to the other airplanes that were flying at that time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.

4 dancing lights AGAIN IN VIRGINIA!! THIS TIME DISAPEAR WITH A HUGE SONIC BOOM!!;2005-12-03 20:40:00;3 hrs;4 dancing lights AGAIN IN VIRGINIA!! THIS TIME DISAPEAR WITH A HUGE SONIC BOOM!! Just like it was reported in February of this year (2005)  Reported: 2/20/2005 4:42:22 PM 16:42  Posted: 2/22/2005  12/03/2005:  I was really surprised to read a posting of a sighting that exactly matches the one I just experienced tonight. The sky was exactly the same and the description of the four lights is exactly the same. The pattern of the four circular lights dancing in a consistent pattern, returning to the middle and repeating in a circular motion is just as I saw it. My sons thought this was cool and my wife thinks I am crazy, although she saw the same thing and says they were advertising spotlights. This could be true, however, the lights you normally would see shooting up to the sky were not ever present. The farther you moved away, the larger the distance of the lights would become. The really cool part is when I went outisde about two hours later to take my dog out, the lights were there doing the same exact thing but then a loud sonic boom blasted through the air as if a space shuttle was taking off, and would you believe that the lights disappeared as the very loud sound diminished? I can almost say with certainty that this sound seemed to be moving up and away from the surface of the earth and up into the sky, just like the space shuttle.

Triangular formation of three white lights;2008-02-16 20:30:00;about a minute;Saturday, February 16, approx 8:30 pm   Traveling Westbound on I-64 in the Williamsburg/James City County area.  I noticed a triangular formation of three white lights off to the right side of the highway that seemed quite close.  The object was partly obscured by the trees along the highway, and for a few seconds it was completely hidden by them.  After a few seconds we could see it again because of a break in the trees, and it was much further away than it had been when first sighted.  My boyfriend was in the passenger seat, and we both agreed it was traveling faster than a plane would.  From inside the car with the windows up, we heard no noise.  The strangest thing about the lights was the formation.  It was as if they were on a flat surface facing us directly.  To better explain, if this had been a plane, it would have been as if  the plane's nose was pointing directly upward from the ground and we were looking at the bottom/top of the plane.  Even after it had gotten farther away, the lights were still in this perfect triangular shape.  The lights were not blinking, they were bright white and did not seem to give off a surrounding glow or beam.  I have reported seeing one other strange object in June of 2006, on the same highway, in relatively same area (Newport News/Williamsburg).

zig zagging white light in sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a sighting of a twinkling star, we suspect.  PD));2010-05-10 03:00:00;40 minutes;zig zagging white light in sky At about 3 am I noticed a white light  at first I thought it might be a plane or a star but it was behaving in a unconventional way.  It was moving up and down and from side to side it was all over the place it seemed as if it was hovering then it would quicky move to the left or right or up and down this lasted for about 40 minutes then it just disappeared as if the light just blinked off.

Flashing red lights that made no noise, that just stood still, some moved slowly and then dissapeared;2012-02-25 15:30:00;1:00;Flashing red lights that made no noise, that just stood still, some moved slowly and then dissapeared While having a cigarette on the balcony, myself, husband, sister, and daughter watched all these red lights as far as the stars flashing. Some of the lights just stood still in the same spot, and some moved very slowly, and even disappeared right before our eyes. I really could not believe what I seeing with my eyes, and was hoping to hear some report about this on the local news.  Havenâ€™t heard anything as of yet, but I did call to report this.  This activity in the sky was very, very, strange indeed!;37.2930092198582;-76.7424794326241
