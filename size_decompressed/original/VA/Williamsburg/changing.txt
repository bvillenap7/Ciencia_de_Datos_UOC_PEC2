My adrenaline was extremely elevated and my mind was seeing with unbelief.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably Sirius.  PD));2004-03-12 00:00:00;2hr 30min;My adrenaline was extremely elevated and my mind was seeing with unbelief. To give a brief description of one of the observers,she is employed by a security dept. She has over 20yrs of service and I feel very truthworthy.  I feel myself to be a very honest person .  I felt this subject a bit difficult to discuss until I pulled up this website and realized that there are thousands of witnesses to this somewhat unbelieveable subject.  I did video what i witnessed and i hope to share it.  The object seemed to do many things from changing color, shape, and size.  The object had many lights around the spaceship looking object and one larger and brighter light in the center.  It did hover for adleast two hours but moved slowly.  AT times it would move quickly and seem to maybe try to camouflage itself by blowing up or getting much larger.  I must say i have never witnessed such a remarkable item in my life.  It also spinned and changed colors.  There is much more that i could say but i hope this will give you some idea to what I'am describing. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the report is consistent with a sighting of a star or planet.  PD));37.2930092198582;-76.7424794326241
