Many Red Lights Observed South of Winchester, VA.;2013-01-17 20:00:00;25 minute;Many Red Lights Observed South of Winchester, VA Approximately 2000 to 2022 hours, 17 Jan, wife and I observed red lights to the south of our location in Winchester, VA.  The lights appeared single and in groups of 3 to 5 and went from bright on the left to fading out toward the right.  We estimated that there were between 35 to 45 lights total (not sure when they started showing).  The lights did not appear to move all in the same direction.  Some of the lights also grouped together and others moved apart.  Attempts to photograph objects did not turn out (too dim and far away).;39.1804814606742;-78.2100606741573
