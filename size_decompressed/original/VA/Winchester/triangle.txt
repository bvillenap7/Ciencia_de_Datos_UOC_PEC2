((HOAX?)) Bunch of red light triangles appeared soon after a high pitch noise w/ the arrival of a blue light ship then all disappeared.;2018-03-06 02:34:00;30 minutes;a bunch of red light triangles appeared soon after a high pitch noise with the arrival of a blue light ship then they all disappeared. there was a bright shining light, i looked out my window and saw around 20 triangle shaped objects in the sky.  They had red lights on all three on the corners except for one craft witch had green lights.  I went to take a photo and they didn't appear threw my camera lens.  about 30 minutes in all you heard was a high pitch noise then a gigantic triangle with blue lights appeared then all the ships including the blue lighted one disappeared.  then reappeared for a few seconds disappeared leaving a blue trail behind.  I think the object might have landed.  then took off and left. ((NUFORC Note:  We are not convinced that this report is a serious-minded submission.  Possible hoax, we suspect.
