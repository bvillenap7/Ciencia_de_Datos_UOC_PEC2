Loud hovering noises at night outside our bedroom window.;2012-08-26 03:00:00;1 minute;Loud hovering noises at night outside our bedroom window We sleep with our windows open now that it's cooler out in the evenings & last night I was awoken by an extremely loud hovering noise.  It lasted only a few moments (it sounded as though it was right next to us) before a loud noise followed WHATEVER was making it.  It's hard to explain, but no aircraft here would make those noises.  We are in a suburban neighborhood, planes cannot come that close to our houses.  This is not the first time there has been something over our house/backyard.  A month ago I was awoken at the same exact time because of a bright flash that flooded through our window & covered our backyard. It lasted only seconds before disappearing. I'm scared.;39.1804814606742;-78.2100606741573
Strange light shooting down from the sky and staying around.;2014-01-30 04:45:00;1 hour;Strange light shooting down from the sky and staying around. I was driving down I66 to go home from work.  As I am driving I call my fianc√© to tell her I am off of work and I am heading home.  Well when the phone started to ring I was just starring into the sky up to the left out of my windshield.  Then as soon as she said hello this bright light zoomed down and made the sky bright and it seemed like lighting hit the ground but it was white then purple then bluish.  After that I just figured it was a shooting star or comet.  Though I have seen many of those this looked nothing like that.  We'll on down the road I started seening this light thinking it was a star I looked closely at it and realized it was changing colors.  So I watched it till I got home.  Then I sat in my truck and parked it in my driveway where I could still see the light.  As I sat and watched it it didn't move and yet it grew larger and then shrunk while becoming larger it changed colors from white to blue to purple and orange.  So I have no idea what I saw.  I just wanted to know if anyone else saw what I saw that night.;39.1804814606742;-78.2100606741573
