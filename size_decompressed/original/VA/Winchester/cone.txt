I was riding around,and the skys were clear, and i was going over a bridge when i saw a large light in the sky. I rolled down my window and looked out and i saw the large lights in triangle formation on the bottom of a glowing cone that was hovering over a pond. On top of the cone there was a flashing red/green light and (from my perspective) an inch below were lights a round the cone like windows. The craft was glowing purple and spinning slowly untill it moved away at a  medium speed and disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does indicate that fact.

Extremely shiny metalic-looking cone-shaped object flying 200 feet above trees at about 400-500 mph;2003-03-27 17:45:00;10 seconds;Extremely shiny metalic-looking cone-shaped object flying 200 feet above trees at about 400-500 mph At 5:45 PM on 3/27/2003 I was driving eastward on Highway 7 in a rural area about halfway between Winchester and Berryville, Virginia. My wife was in our vehicle with me when we both saw an extremely shiny metallic-looking object flying northward about one mile ahead of us. The object was traveling at about 400-500 mph (based on my experience as a licensed airplane pilot) about 200 feet above the tree tops. It was difficult for me to determine a distinct shape, but my wife, who had more time to observe the object because I was driving, said it was cone-shaped or bullet-shaped. The object traveled in a straight line and at constant altitude until it was no longer visible over the tree-lined horizon after observing it for about 10 seconds. We heard no sound.;39.1804814606742;-78.2100606741573
