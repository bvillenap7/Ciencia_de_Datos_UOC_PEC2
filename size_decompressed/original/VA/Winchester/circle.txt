I observed a round disk coming from the Washington DC area with what looked like small wires on the perifery as it rotated. It took a 90 degree left turn and proceeded down the Shenandoah Valley, The total time was about 6 seconds. I inhaled and waited for an explosion due to the speed involved. There never was a sound. I have 1600 hours flying and never have seen anything like it.In August or Sept.of that year, Popular Mechanics or Science featured a craft like it on its cover. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

25-30 circular lights over winchester va;2013-04-10 01:00:00;1 minute;25-30 circular lights over winchester va Well I first attempted to call in this report because it was a very humbling experience. . Ok I decided to write down what me and my roommate saw last night anyways because it was an eye opening experience. I was inside last night at about 12:57 cooking when my roommate stepped out to smoke a cigarette.  About three minutes later he rushed inside and yelled for me to come out. i rushed outside and looked up.  What I saw was about 25-30 round circular lights all bunched together very closely.  Almost looked like a swarm of bees they were so close together.  The lights were right above cloud level but moving north at a very high rate of speed.  I watched the crafts all form into an arrow righ! t when I saw them first and I could tell that each light was a separate craft.  I observed the lights for about a minute as they moved out of my eye range.;39.1804814606742;-78.2100606741573
Large circular light seen above horizon, completely faded to  black within minutes.;2014-08-27 05:10:00;3 minutes;Large circular light seen above horizon, completely faded to  black within minutes. Looking eastward, large circular shape that I mistook for a fog-covered moon until I noticed that the sky was completely clear.   Light was within 10 miles approx 30 degrees above horizon line.   Light was bright enough to have mistaken for the moon and over three minutes faded away to what seemed to be a blue/violet circular haze.;39.1804814606742;-78.2100606741573
