white oval with fuzzy edges hovering then disappeared;2008-11-01 02:00:00;1-3 minute;white oval with fuzzy edges hovering then disappeared My friend and I were heading north on 81 getting closer to Winchester VA when I was sick of driving and just looking out into the sky and saw an oval white shaped object hovering ( over the tree line a ways out). It also had an eminating fuzz like glow right close to the object, much like a mirror reflecting light. It appeared to be not moving and then after takes between the road and back to the sky it had moved over to the right(faster than a plane can travel) in the time it takes to look at the road and back to the sky, possibly over the town area. This was no way a blimp over a small town, because it disappeared in an instant. Time wasn't something i was paying attention to so im going to guess about 1.5 minutes or so. If you were someone driving north on 81 it is almost impossible to miss this. so hopefully there will be more postings to help this sighting.;39.1804814606742;-78.2100606741573

I saw numerous oval shaped lights just hanging in the sky.  Then two of the lights began to plunge towards the earth leaving a trail behind them unlike anything I have ever seen.  The other lights just hung in mid air, not blinking or moving at all.  Then in a blink they were all just gone.  I did snap a few pictures that need to be zoomed in and cleaned up.;39.1804814606742;-78.2100606741573
