Around 1979, in warm climate, I was sitting outdoors with 2 friends in college right after dinner.  We did not drink nor do drugs so our vision and minds were not under any influence.  In the dark, all of a sudden, a UFO flew by silently and right above the 2 story dining hall building that we sitting outside of.  It flew by us in a split second.  One friend looked at me shocked in disbelief.  I would not have believed my own eyes, except my friend saw it too.  The other (third) friend never saw nor heard anything and was convinced that the two of us who saw it, had fabricated the story.  That shows you how silent and quick the UFO flew by. The shape was the classic saucer shape.  The size was huge - bigger than a helicopter, but smaller than the building.  The UFO was a dark silver color, and had one string of lights going around it, on the side I saw. The amazing thing is that it was so close and yet so absolutely silent.  I have never seen anything ever again that flies so silently.  I always felt bad about not reporting it, but we didn't know who to report it to.  I was glad to have recently discovered this website and hope this helps by adding one more piece of the big puzzle to solve credible and mysterious UFO citings.
