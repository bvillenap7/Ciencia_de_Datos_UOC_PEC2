My wife and I took our dog out for his nightly walk in our front yard. We live in a country setting in central Virginia with virtually no glow from city lights.  Often we sit on our dock and count the satellite's passing overhead, we both enjoy gazing at the sky.  On this night, 7/24/09 at 22:15 I saw what appeared to be a satellite traveling north to south however, this object's brightness intensified to a point it was clearly the brighest object in the sky and maintained that level for approximatetly 10 seconds.  As both of us looked on in amazement it quickly dimmed orange in color than disappeared from our sight. At no time did we hear any noise;37.1817;-79.6507
