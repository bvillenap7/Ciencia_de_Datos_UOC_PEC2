Multicolored noiseless objects sitting in the night sky over Pulaski County, Virginia.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible stars??  PD));2014-11-18 23:00:00;1 hour;Multicolored noiseless objects sitting in the night sky over Pulaski County, Virginia. On 18 November 2014 a little after 11 pm my wife and I observed two objects in the sky several miles apart east of Claytor Lake in Pulaski County.  The objects made no sound and sat motionless in the sky for over an hour.  Each object appeared as a tight cluster of multicolored blinking lights - white, red, green, and blue.   After watching for an hour and attempting to take photos we drove home.   Several months earlier we had watched another of these objects hovering over Northwest Pulaski County, again at night, sitting motionless in the sky and making no sound.   We observed this object for 2 hours before going back in the house.  On both occasions the objects were later noted to have departed the area. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible stars??  PD));37.0574;-80.7722
