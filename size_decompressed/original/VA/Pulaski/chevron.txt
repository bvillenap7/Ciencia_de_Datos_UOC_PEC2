Object or craft trailed by orange light traveling at incredible speed.;2014-09-05 18:30:00;seconds;Object or craft trailed by orange light traveling at incredible speed. My deck overlooks a broad valley with a mountain ridge in the background.   On September 5, 2014, in the late afternoon the valley was covered with thick fog with the ridge clear and highlighted by the sun above the fog.  I took multiple photos of the interesting view.  In only one photo, taken at 6:30 PM, a small bright dot was seen above the ridge.  Enlarged, the dot appears to be an object or craft followed by orange flames.   A family member suggested it was space debris burning on re-entry.  On-line research did not show any debris reported or expected to reenter the atmosphere that day.   Weeks later I carefully viewed all the other photos taken at about that time.  In the photo taken 6 seconds after that one, there is a smaller dot in the further distance which when enlarged appears to be a delta shaped craft.   Both of these images appear in only one of the two photos taken 6 seconds apart.  If they are of the same object, then it was traveling at incredible speed.;37.0574;-80.7722
