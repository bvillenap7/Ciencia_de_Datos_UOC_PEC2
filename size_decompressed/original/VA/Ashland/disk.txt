Two saucer sighting and one alien sighting.;1971-06-30 21:00:00;driving;Two saucer sighting and one alien sighting. I was driving down the road with my boyfriend and looked in the sky and at first thought I saw an airplane, but it wasn't moving it was staying in one spot. I watched for a minute and got my boyfriends attendion and said look, that airplane isn't moving. Then is just took off up into the sky so fast, that you know nothing on this earth could go that fast. About six months later in the exact same spot we saw the same thing agian. Both of these events took place at night. The object were the same both time, like a sauser shape. Couldn't tell the color. Each time there was only one. Another time I was sitting on the front porch and was looking across the road into the nabors big field and saw something tall, all black, with long legs and arms. Looked like somthing off the movie with Will Smith in that alien move. It was walking on the edge of the woods. I was too far away the get any details on the face or anything else. From where i was sitting I would say I was about 300 houdreds yards away and the thing was half as tall as the trees. These were tall pine trees and it's head came to the middle of the tree. I saw it for about 30 sec and couldn't take my eyes away in shock. It disappeared into the trees. All these sighting have happened in the same area. I know about 3 other people that live in these area that have seen similar things as I have described. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
