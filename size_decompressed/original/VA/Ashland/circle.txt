The sighting occured while visiting KINGS DOMINON THEME PARK,my daughter and I were waiting in line for a rollercoaster.Across the park we watched a black ring rise into the clouds,it leveled off and began moving in one direction.As the black ring came directly over the park,I realized that it was very large in diameter (200-300 feet).We watched the object slow almost to a stop,then appear to change course and resume its previous velocity.This black ring was hollow in the center,perfectly round,and perfectly shaped.There was cloud cover that afternoon,but you could see the ring moving inside the clouds.There was a lot of people watching and talking,including my wife and youngest daughter,but after we left the park we never heard another word about it.;37.7395;-77.4784
