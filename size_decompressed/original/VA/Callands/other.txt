Then what appeared to be about 100 yards on front of this arra I walked out side to take out the trash.  I see a about wide as high as the trees a set of lights... red with a band of white lights with a red light under that.  Then what appeared to be about 100 yards on front of this array was one big red light that was the size of the array behind it.  The two sets of lights appeared attached by a body between them that was too dark to see.  It went along the tree line heading east down hwy 57 toward Chatham va .. guess it was going 50 mph..slow...no noise.  Then the lead light dissapeared....then it reappeared as the craft went out of sight. ..... when I first saw it..I called my co worker out she saw it to and said she never saw anything like it.;36.7656;-79.6239
