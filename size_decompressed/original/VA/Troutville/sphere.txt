Aircraft could be seen clearly as it was clear dusk night with sun showing all air craft contrails which we were admiring.  There was no contrail to what we saw.  Clearly an Unidentified Flying Object way to close to planes.  There were five planes that could be seen with no problems.

Shiney sphere gets brighter then fades out.;2010-10-16 18:00:00;1 minute;Shiney sphere gets brighter then fades out. Overlooking mountain range toward the west from Troutville, this bright sphere object appeared. The sun was shining upon it from a southern direction. There are other aircraft in sky however they all are leaving a line behind them from the fuel. This object does not have any trail behind it. The shiney object does not move either. It stays still and while we watched the object, it got brighter with the shine. Then it totally disappear. No star or satellite came up from that direction either once the sun did set.;37.4019;-79.8786
