Floyd VA triangle UFO spotted 0n 4 April 2013.;2013-04-06 20:34:00;3 minutes;Floyd VA triangle UFO spotted 0n 4 April 2013 Driving on Hwy 221 towards Roanoke VA from Floyd City on right of roadside high in sky (but not as high as a jet would fly) was a very large and bright triangle shaped object with lights at each corner but what appeared to be empty space between the pinkish colored lights.  It was moving slowly in sequence and it had 3 additional blinking lights in a line coming from the lower left side of the triangle moving with the triangle but at different lengths from the triangle (not a straight line but moved in unison together) when we dipped into a small valley we lost sight of it and when we came out of the dip and topped the next hill (higher than the one we had viewed the triangle) we lost sight of the lights...
