2 objects change shape....;2007-06-09 22:00:00;30 seconds;2 objects change shape.... I was star gazing.  I observed an object moving from the E/NE which looked like a plane at high altitube, or about 20-30k feet.  It traveled a short distance and then condensed to a tiny dot and then changed direction as if it was heading straight out of our atmosphere at a very high rate of speed. I was able to follow it for a few seconds but then it was out of sight. Less than 10 seconds late I observed the exact same thing  same directions, same speeds, same stange occurance. No noise at all, and it was a very clear night.;36.6773;-76.9342999999999
