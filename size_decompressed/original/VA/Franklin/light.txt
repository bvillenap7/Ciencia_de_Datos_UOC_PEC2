Extremely bright light over Franklin, VA.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD));2007-03-10 21:00:00;2 hours;Extremely bright light over Franklin, VA At approx. 9 pm I was taking my dogs out to my back yard and decided to go out with them.  It was an extremely clear evening and I immediately noticed a very bright object that resembled a star but much brighter than any other star in the sky. I walked to the rear of my yard to get an unobstructed view as there were 4 large pines in the way. I stood at the fence lining the yard and just stared at it.  It was so bright that when I closed my eyes there was a sun-spot in my vision(like when you stare at the sun). It was rather difficult to focus on for too long and I started to think this may not be a star or planet.  I went into the house and asked my wife to come and look at it. She agreed that it was weird and that it was extremely bright and both of us had a hard time telling if it was moving.  I went inside to my computer and searched for any planets which may be in view that night and the only thing that I found was Mercury (I think) but that was only going to be visible by telescope and only in the SouthWest and Mexico. I went back outside and it was still there but seemed to have moved away towards the NW. I marked it in the sky using some ground landmarks. After standing and watching for about 10 minutes more I decided to go in. I checked a couple more times and it seemed to move farther and farther away each time but clearly still very brilliant. There was never any sound, no blinking lights, and did not appear the next evening. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  Sighting of Venus?
