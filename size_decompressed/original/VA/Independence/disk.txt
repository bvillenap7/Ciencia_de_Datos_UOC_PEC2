Disk shaped object tracking airplane.;2013-10-17 19:40:00;5 minutes;Disk shaped object tracking airplane On the evening of 10/17/2013 at approximately 7:40 PM, my wife and I saw a bright light in the sky that looked like a large star.  However the light was moving North/East, it was not blinking but stayed the same blue/white color.   Because of the movement we watched the disk-shaped object for several seconds.  Then we saw an airplane with flashing lights moving to the South/West a distance from the disk.  The disk seemed to stop for a second or two and then started moving in a South/West direction as if following the airplane.  It didn’t seem to make a turn as an airplane would but just stopped and started in the opposite direction.   It tracked the airplane behind and slightly to the right for quite a distance across the sky.  Then it started climbing, getting higher and higher, until disappearing out of sight.  It is hard to judge the size of the object, but from our perspective the blinking lights of the airplane would compare to the end of a pencil but the disk would compare to the eraser of a pencil, it was quite large.  We watched the object for approximately 5 minutes, heard no noise until the airplane moved overhead with the disk tracking it.  Don’t know what it was but thought it odd that it seemed to be tracking the airplane. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
