Amber light over new kent, va;2012-09-11 21:55:00;30 seconds;Amber light over new kent, va While flying from Richmond, Va to West Point, Va we observed an amber light (round) similar to appearance as if an approaching aircraft.  It appeared to be 5 miles north east of us (we were heading east/south east).  We noticed it when it appeared to be at 800 feet asl and climbing.  If had to guess, rate of speed it would be 150kts.  The light appeared to climb straight-vertical until extinguishing near 5000 feet (guesstimate).  ATC did not see aircraft on radar when inquired.  No trailing seen.  No blinking seen.  One solid orb.  Thank you  It is ok to contact me. Not requesting contact.;37.553;-77.0742
