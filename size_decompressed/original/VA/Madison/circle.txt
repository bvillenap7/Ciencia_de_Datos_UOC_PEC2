It's not much to report as far as a craft goes, because it was so far away it looked like a star however , it's movements made it a craft of some kind.  It moved in a triangular pattern for quite awhile.   I mostly wanted to know if there were other reports from the same time.   Please contact me if so.  I tried to film it on my digital camera, but because it was night, I'm not sure how well it came out yet.   It's location was approximately 40 degrees up into the northern sky;38.3716;-78.299
Eight to ten circular objects in triangular formation near high cumulus cloud in daytime.;2007-11-16 13:30:00;20 seconds;Eight to ten circular objects in triangular formation near high cumulus cloud in daytime. Friday,  November 16,  2007 at around 1:30 p.m., I’m standing in a field in Madison County, Virginia as my daughter is riding her horse. Staring up at a beautiful isolated puffy white cloud in a northwest direction I spot something unusual. The sky was perfect blue and it was a bit windy. I stare through my polarizing glasses, which allowed me to see the clouds and sky clearly, at 8 to 10 small round shaped white objects moving in formation similar to Canadian geese forming and reforming a triangular shape. My immediate reaction was that it was a flock flying as you always see them. As I watched, I realized they were up by the clouds some 5,000 to 8,000 feet or more, and were colored white, not the usual dark color of geese, and staying very close to the cloud at that high altitude. I watched for some 15 to 20 seconds until all of a sudden they disappeared into the cloud. I kept watching for another 2 minutes or so until the powerful winds quickly swept the cloud away. I kept searching the blue sky for the objects, but saw nothing. Later I was kicking myself for not getting my camera, which was in the car about 300 feet away and taking a shot of the interesting sight, but my mind was too busy at the time trying to make sense of what I was seeing. Fortunately, I am a computer artist and illustrator and was able to recreate the event soon after the sighting in Photoshop. The more I thought about the event the more I realized I’d never seen anything like that before.;38.3716;-78.299
