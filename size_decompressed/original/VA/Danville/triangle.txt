I watched for maybe 10 seconds before it went vertical at speed I can't describe then horizontal and out of sight.;36.602892173913;-79.4123808695653

UFO hoovered @ approximately 10,000 feet up.  Bright white light would pop on for approximately 2 minutes, then would slowly fade out, it did this repeatedly.  After about 10 minutes of hovering in one place, it began to rise further into the sky, in a zig-zag motion, then took off at the rate of speed planes normally appear to be flying.;36.602892173913;-79.4123808695653

Extremely large, quiet, triangle shaped UFO spotted in Pittsylvania County, VA.;2014-05-23 23:30:00;12 seconds;Extremely large, quiet, triangle shaped UFO cpotted in Pittsylvania County, VA. At approximately 11:30 p.m. while stargazing for the Camelopardalid meteor shower, I noticed a light moving into my line of sight.  The UFO was moving NNW to SE at a steady pace.  I would not necessarily have thought UFO, but several things struck me as odd:  Firstly the size.   The UFO appeared to be HUGE.  I have no standard of comparison for something in the sky, however, this was much bigger than any plane or helicopter that I've seen in my experience.  The only other conclusion I could come to is that it was flying low, but even still that wouldn't explain the sound, the hushed blowing sound that accompanied it.  There was barely any sound to it, like when you run a clothes dryer with a load of towels.  (Sorry, just using things I can compare it to here!)  I looked up videos of B2s at night and flight shows just in case I may have seen one of those for some reason and the lighting doesn't resemble what the videos show, although the shape is similar.   As for lights, there were 4, 2 on each wing tip, 1 white, 1 red. Unfortunately, I had a camera set up facing north for the meteor shower, and had my phone on my person at the time - once I saw the object I stood transfixed.  I felt unable to move or even think.  I'm not sure if I was just startled by the size of the UFO or what.;36.602892173913;-79.4123808695653
