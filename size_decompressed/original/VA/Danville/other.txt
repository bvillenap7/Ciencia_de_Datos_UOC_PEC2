Located two vertical line shaped UFOs outside of Danville.;2013-08-01 03:05:00;10 minutes;Located two vertical line shaped UFOs outside of Danville. I was nine miles outside of Danville near Milton, NC, with a friend just driving around in the AM.  Went to the end of a road and turned around, drove about five minutes back to a T intersection I had passed previously that morning.  Two lines appeared an estimated two hundred yards away in a grass field, containing 3 dots of light each. One of the lines was red and the other was white (and strobing).  Lines were separated about one hundred yards horizontally.  The red lights were obviously touching the ground, however, the white lights remained a constant three to five feet above the ground, and nearest to a tree line. We stopped for a moment and my friend shined a light in the direction of the objects but we still couldn't clearly make them out.  Eventually, we left, wondering what we'd seen. I didn't stay to find out what it was, because I got an incredibly bad feeling about what was going on.;36.602892173913;-79.4123808695653
