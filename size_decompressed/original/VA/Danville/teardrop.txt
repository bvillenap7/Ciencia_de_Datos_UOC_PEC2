I was in the car with my mother on Highway 85 going toward the mall when I spotted a black, upside down, curved, tearshaped object hovering over the highway. My mother, who was driveing, thought it might be a kite or a balloon and ignored it. I got a good look at it and it was a very strange shape. It didn't look like any kite or balloon to me. It had a blue floresent auric discharge over the top which realy made it UFO like...It was about 7ft tall and 3ft wide, hovering 500ft above the road. We drove right under it and continued to our destination. When we returned a few minutes later it was gone.;36.602892173913;-79.4123808695653
