A DIAMOND SHAPED OBJECT HOVERED SIDE BY SIDE IN THE SKY FLYING UP FOR 1 HOUR.;2010-11-17 04:00:00;1 HOUR;A DIAMOND SHAPED OBJECT HOVERED SIDE BY SIDE IN THE SKY FLYING UP FOR 1 HOUR. THIS MORNING AROUND 4:00 AM I SAW A UFO IT WAS LIKE A DIAMOND THAT HOVERED SIDE TO SIDE IN THE SAME SPOT FOR OVER ONE HOUR.   IT HAD BRIGHT LIGHTS THAT KEPT BEAMING THEN IT APPREARED LIKE IT WAS GONNA FLY AWAY BUT, IT JUST KEPT GOING SIDE TO SIDE.   THEN IT MOVED UP AND DOWN AND BEGIN TO FLY JUST A LITTLE BIT THEN IT STOPPED. AND STAYED THERE IN THE ONE AREA FOR AN HOUR.    AS DAYBREAK APPROACHED IT WENT FUTHER AWAY LIKE A DISTANCE WHICH WAS HARDER TO SEE.  THIS SIGHTING OF THE UFO WAS OVER THE SIDE OF THE DAN RIVER MILLS HERE IN DNVILLE VIRGINIA.  IT WAS AWSOME! I FEEL LIKE I MADE CONNECT WITH THIS SPACE CRAFT. BECAUSE IT WANTED ME TO SEE IT.  WHEN I LIVED IN NORTH CAROLINA ON THE MOUNTAIN WHERE I GREW UP WE SAW A FLYING SAUCER IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I SEEN A UFO THEN.  IT WAS EARLY AND IT WAS VERY COLD THAT MORNING, IT WAS WINTER TIME, THE UFO FLEW ACROSS THE SKY UP ABOVE A PINE TREE IN THE YARD, IT LOOKED LIKE THE JETSON SPACE SHIP.  IT FLEW IN HALF OF A CIRCLE AND IT! WAS MOVING SO FAST BEYOND THE DETERMINATION OF SPEED. BUT IT LET US SEE IT.  I WAS VERY EXCITED WHEN I SAW THE UFO IT FLEW ON THE RIGHT SIDE THEN WENT AWAY. THAT'S IT THANK YOU VERY MCUH.;36.602892173913;-79.4123808695653

I drove several miles and it never moved.  I pulled over and took several pictures with my phone.  One picture took but it appeared as a large light source and did not have the borders that were so plainly seen with the naked eye.  It appeared as it was hovering over my city.  As I got to town, I picked up my riders as I'm a Medi-caid driver. I picked up 3 passengers and I immediately began to describe what I saw.  They didn't seem to interested until I pulled up to the stop sign and I said, OK then what is that?  They all said Oh my God, what is that?  WE sat there for a few moments observing it. It appeared it was not moving but stationary.  There were no stars in the sky making this a phenomenal sight.  The outer portion of the main part of the object was outlined in green lights.  It looked like a children's top that you pushed on the top and it would spin on the floor.  The top had a light orange on it.  You could see the outline of what appeared as fins.  They had no lights on them but it appeared as a silhouette of light coming from the body.  They appeared to be the shape of a point on a 5 point star that you would draw. I was extremely excited as I've always wanted to see a UFO. At the same time I was scared. I didn't know what it's purpose was and were there a lot of these throughout the nation or just over Danville. I called the police on 911 and explained what I was seeing. They asked where i was and I told them and they said they would have an office come out. I told the dispatch lady an officer doesn't need to come where I'm at just tell him to go out of the building and he'll see it.   When I got back into town I called the police station.  They said that the night shift, whom I talked with DID NOT leave any messages about a strange light.  I thought, that's crazy!  I then called the radio station and they gave me the same message.  I thought if any one was outside! this morning, they would have seen this thing.  As I watched it, I had the unusual feeling that it wanted to contact me.  It scared me as I did not know what it's intentions were.  Was it friendly, were they violent, etc.;36.602892173913;-79.4123808695653
