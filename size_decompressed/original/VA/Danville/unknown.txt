Obvious non-human air craft;2011-08-01 01:00:00;2 hours;Obvious non-human air craft Last night a friend and myself were going outside for a smoke when we noticed a very unusual light in the far distant sky that was a circle from what we could see..  It was just hovering and moving in up and down, side to side motion.  We then noticed that there were planes that were coming around and then circling the craft. After maybe 20 minutes a second and third one appeared, however they left just as quickly as they had came. There were also beams of light that kept flying overhead. Too many to be shooting stars. At about 2:00 am, there was a big beam of light that fell from the sky then became very large and turned bright green with a ring around it right above the tree line.  Then it vanished.   My friend and I said to each other we had both had times that we could say “might have been ufo’s” but this was most defiantly the clearest it has ever been to seeing such an event that we could not move from where we stood.   Shortly after the object that had been hovering disappeared behind the trees over a field  where there is a river that runs through our city.  And there was no more activity of any planes or anything after that. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));36.602892173913;-79.4123808695653
Red green and blue spinning light seen in the sky in front of Orion. 05-06-12.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius??  PD));2012-05-06 21:35:00;30 mins;red green and blue spinning light seen in the sky in front of Orion. 05-06-12  500 Lights On Object0: Yes I walked outside to smoke a cig and saw a bright light in the sky. I though my eyes was playing tricks on me after walking out into the dark, so I waited to see if it was a jet or planted or whatever. after only a sec in the dark my eyes had adjusted and I could see this bright flashing light had a red green and blue type colored light flashing and spinning around the outside of it. it was hovering in the sky and every few mins it would move side to side and looked as if it was shooting out some type of light or lazier beam.  I took two videos with my cell phone but was not sure if anything was going to show up because nothing showed up on my cell phone screen while i was shooting the video's.  after a lil over 30'mins  Im thinking  tha light shot across the sky and was gone.. I come inside and got my ipad to see what stars or plants were in the sky in the spot where the UFO had been. I was already at a loss for words, the constellation Orion was the exac! t spot the UFO had been in and the direction it flu off in. so I put the SD card from my cell in my laptop and open my videos, I find the one I just took at the bottom of the list, number 33. the bright light i saw the hole time only shows up in the video as flashes a few times but the thing i dont understand and kinda freaks me out is after 5 or 10 sec in the video its big flashes of light and stuff, i dont know what to call it, light, flying at the camera. im going to take another video in the dark just to make sure my camera/cell dont do anything thing odd shooting in the dark. it seems all a lil corny, constellation Orion ,Video 33. IDK. hope other ppl saw this. thanks :) <_*_*_>;36.602892173913;-79.4123808695653
White Lights no sound.;2014-01-06 22:15:00;15-20 minutes;White Lights no sound January 8, 2014  On January 6 at 10:15 P.M. I stepped outside to have a cigarette as soon as I opened the door I saw bright white lights almost directly above me.  The craft was traveling East at about 400-500 feet and moving at around 40 miles an hour.  The strange thing I immediately noticed was there was no sound coming from the craft.  No Doppler effect from Jet engines, no prop sounds. The craft had several white lights on steady and one slow flashing light on the back.  I could not see any on the front. Most of the air craft I see are high fly jets, moving North to South or further to the East from South to North.  This craft was heading East. We do have fighter jets that every once and awhile heading to Smyth Mountain Lake Damn on (from what we have heard) bomber training.  The shake the house and you can hear them for miles after. Last night I stepped outside again at 9:30 and the craft was there again. This time further away but heading East and at the same altitude.  I watched until it was at the horizon through the trees, then it headed South. I didn’t put it together at the time, but the first I saw the craft I cam back inside and told my wife. She has had some health issues lately but, nothing to bad, but it keeps me on edge. About one half hour after telling her, she sat forward in her chair and held her head. I asked her if she was OK.  She told me she felt light headed and her stomach felt queezy.  As she was telling me, my head started feeling light and my stomach felt like I was on a roller coaster.  The symptoms went away with 10 minutes. Last night as the lights faded away I was getting ready to go back inside and my lips started to tingle, my head felt a little light and my stomach felt a little strange.  I am not a believer in UFO’s from other planets, I do believe in government black ops. The hardest thing I have a hard time with is that there was no sound at all.  I know it wasn’t a blimp as I’ve heard those before.  It wasn’t a plane or jet. I could make out any shape, besides what looked like a tail of a plane.  The white light had a strange appearance, almost a glow more that light. It didn’t spin or make any strange movments.;36.602892173913;-79.4123808695653
Giant object hiding behind clouds.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a shadow, cast by a high-altitude cloud.  PD));2015-05-31 20:00:00;1 hour;Giant object hiding behind clouds. This evening, my family and I went to Danville, Va, to watch a movie.  Upon exiting the theater, my sister pointed out an extremely strange shadow beyond the clouds of a thunderstorm.  The enclosed photos show details of an object with extremely sharp edges with protrusions.  Judging by the shadow that was visible, I estimate the object to be the size of a Mountain if not larger. Several other patrons were exiting the theater at the same time and noticed the shadow cast on the sky.  Once we got in our vehicles, we went to another location in the city to enjoy the afternoon sunset before the thunderstorm got to Danville. Again we observed the shadow.  Once home while using Google earth, the direct line of distance to the second sighting location of the shadow is 2.66 miles.  Using the Dan River as a sight tool and observing the radar display of the storm cell on the Weather Channel app,  I was able to determine the cloud base to be between 10 to 15 miles west of our location.  I have lived in extremely mountainous terrain and also visited nearly all major metropolitan cities in the US.  With that being said, I have never observed such a shadow being cast in the sky during sunset by either of the two.  There are no jagged mountain peaks such as you would think that would cast such a shadow in Virginia, only gently rolling hills. The highest point in Virginia is Mount Rogers at 5,729 feet above sea level.  Mount Rogers is approximately 120 miles due west of the location of the second sighting.  Again using Google earth, the direction of the shadow, the location of the storm cell, and using the river as a sight tool does no add up to any known land based objects being able to cast a shadow this high into the sky.  Therefore, I concluded the object to be airborne and stationary.  I also am able to rule out cloud formations as a cause due to not ever being able to recall a cloud produce such a pinpoint and exact shape across the sky.  There were a total of 6 persons in my party who witnessed this anomaly.  Their ages range from 13 to 55.  The photos were taken by an Iphone 5s with HDR in the off, auto and on positions.  The photos were taken just outside the theater.  The time stamp indicated 20:04 on the first photo and 20:05 on the last. There were 8 photos of this on my phone when I downloaded them at home.  I was unable to obtain photos from the second viewing site because I left my phone in the car to charge. Whatever it was,  It was enormous.;36.602892173913;-79.4123808695653
