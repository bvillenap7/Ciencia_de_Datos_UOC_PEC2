This object was very large and very bright whitish and somewhat gold in color.The entire object was illuminated. The object was completely still in its location. This lasted for about a minute and then the object disapeared as if turning a light out.A few minutes later the object reappeared again in the same exact position and location.This time the object appearence lasted for about 2 to 3 minutes before disapearing.This was not the last time i would see this object,the second appearence was with a wittness.
