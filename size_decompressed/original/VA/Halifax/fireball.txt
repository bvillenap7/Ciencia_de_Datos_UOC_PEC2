Yellow, round, flashing lights in E night sky, pulsating downward to trees becoming brighter then repeating the pattern for hours.;2015-06-22 03:00:00;2 hours;Yellow round flashing lights in eastern night sky pulsating downward to trees becoming brighter then repeating the pattern for hours. Observed on three clear nights this week in eastern sky and in northern sky bright yellow balls pulsating downward glowing which then glowed in the trees for about three seconds but then instantly appeared in sky again to repeat the same pattern. When charting the positions, it appears that one yellow ball flashes light three times as it descends and when it reaches the trees, it darts to another tree about 20' away as it flashes one time, then to another and another, then appears high in sky again to repeat the pattern every thirty seconds. Since my property lot is 200’ depth, the trees where this is sighted are probably 100’ from the east window in the house where observations occur. When the yellow light balls reached the trees, the lights were larger about the size of a golf ball, but one glowed brighter about size of a tennis ball which appeared in the tree about 20' from the ground. One of these flashing yellow lights was observed darting about 10' over the house across the street in the westward direction and then remained motionless for a few seconds in the pecan tree in that yard near the carport.  This is probably 60’ from the west window where observation occurred.;36.75062;-78.93664
