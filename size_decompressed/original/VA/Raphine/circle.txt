As it decended closer to the ground a huge row of side lights illuminated and then went black.  Less than a minute later this HUGE craft reappeared horizontally 100' above the field, silent, one outer row of white lights, one inner row if white lights.  Very bright lights.  After approx 2 min, the craft went completely black again, at which time we sought to get inside.   After searching for a similar picture of what we saw, we found a picture online of the same exact craft that was seen June 1, 2015, over Goodview VA.;37.934;-79.2229
