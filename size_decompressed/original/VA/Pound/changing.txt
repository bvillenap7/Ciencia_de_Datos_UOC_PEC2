Very good perspective. I was outside doing some last minute things for Christmas.  When I initially noticed the object it just seemed to appear on the horizon.  We live in a mountainous region.  I was observing this object on a VERY clear night night with almost unlimited visibility.  The object was observed on the horizon on a mountain ridge across from my residence.  I approximate the distance from myself to the object at 1 mile.  From my view point, I was looking across the artificial horizon created by the mountain against the sky.  Beyond the mountain, there was illumination created by a local shopping center.  The object was certainly in the air.  It was approximately 150 ft in the air over the ridge.  It just stayed there.  There was no movement as an aircraft would behave. I know the aircraft traffic patterns in our location and this was way out of those normal patterns and very low.  It had no defining navigation lights.  It had a very odd shape.  It seemed to change shape.   The illumination coming from the object was very aura like.  It had an electric, clear, sort of blue color to it. It seemed to change colors slightly as I observed some slight red and orange but overall the electric blue. The object descended into the tree line and moved in an almost hover like fashion.  There was left to right movement moving slowly along the top of the ridge.  Finallly, it descended into the tree line and I could move to look between the trees and could catch glimpses of the illumination coming from the object.   I fly remote controlled airplanes and I am an aviation buff. I have never seen anything like this before.;37.0914;-82.6064
