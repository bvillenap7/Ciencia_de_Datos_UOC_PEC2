Hovered without sound- moved at a slow speed and accelerate at extrodinary speed.;1975-07-15 01:30:00;30 minutes;Hovered without sound- moved at a slow speed and accelerate at extrodinary speed. Three hundred feet above ground- hovering, lights encircled perimeter of craft.  One large light in the center of the craft, emitting yellowish, red glow.  One hundred and fifty feet in diameter, metallic gray in color.  I watched craft in set position for twenty minutes, unmoving.  No engine noise of any kind.  The craft then ascended to six hundred feet.  And slowly moved in Southwestern direction.  I followed the craft by highway, for ten minutes, until in a flash it covered a distance of not less than three miles and was gone!  Wondering what I had just seen, I noticed a returning light on the sky line, and the craft reappeared and slowly faded away in a Westernly direction. Returning home, at what should have been 2:00 am. I find that two hours has elapsed and is totally unaccounted for.  The sighting has affected me very much for the past thirty-one years.  I was the worlds worst skeptic before the sighting.  But now I know beyond a shadow of a doubt, that we are not alone! ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD));37.0914;-82.6064
