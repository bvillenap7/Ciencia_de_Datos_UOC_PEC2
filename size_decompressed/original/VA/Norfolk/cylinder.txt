Cylindrical object spotted in Norfolk.;2017-07-30 19:30:00;5 minutes;Cylindrical object spotted in Norfolk. I was in my backyard with my 2 year old son around sunset, and we were looking at the moon, when we noticed in the sky at high altitude in close proximity to the moon (about 4 o'clock) a cylindrical type object with long panels extending the length of both sides of it that appeared to be hovering in the sky.   At first I thought it was a plane but I observed no contrails and then thought that maybe it was a satelite or the ISS, however after about 5 minutes, it vanished from view.   There were no clouds in the sky and the object did not move from its location, it literally just vanished.;36.8754303754265;-76.2648143344713
White cylindrical object with trailing haze, bigger than our plane, pilots don’t know what it is.;2021-02-09 18:31:00;10 minutes;White cylindrical object with trailing haze, bigger than our plane, pilots don’t know what it is. United Airlines flight 301. White cylindrical object with rounded nose (like a tic tac..?), appeared as we started our descent to land.  It had no discernible lights but very luminescent in the darkness, size  bigger than our plane about twice. At first I thought it was a plane on fire or some kind of test for releasing water for fighting forest fires- but the haze kept growing.  It moved across the sky with a swirling haze behind it (have pictures too) parallel to the ground towards the ocean. The event lasted for only a few minutes before it vanished above the water leaving the smoke/haze to disperse. Pilots couldn’t figure it out what it was, they called in but it was not like anything they seen before and we had a good laugh since it was such a surprise. Working as an engineer I assumed it was new technology, or a test- but it was an odd place. If it’s a new phenomena I would love to know what it was.;36.8754303754265;-76.2648143344713
