WAS NOT SEEN IN NEVEDA, BUT IN NORFOLK, VA!!!!;2002-06-12 21:00:00;2 minutes;WAS NOT SEEN IN NEVEDA, BUT IN NORFOLK, VA!!!! AS I WAS WALKING FROM MY CAR TO THE SHIP LASTNIGHT, I NOTICED AN OBJECT IN THE SKY. BEING USE TO THE AIR TRAFFIC ON BASE, I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST A PLANE PASSING BY. BUT WHEN I LOOKED AT THE OBJECT, I NOTICED HOW THE LIGHTS WERE POSITIONED. INSTEAD OF THE LIGHTS BEING ON EACH END OF THE CRAFT, THEY WERE LINED UP SIDE BY SIDE. MULTIPLE COLORS SUCH AS RED, GREEN, YELLOW, AND ORANGE. IT WAS STRANGE TO ME AT FIRST, BUT I KIND OF THOUGHT IT WAS PROBABLY A HARRIER. IT ENTERED INTO SOME STORM CLOUDS, AND SUDDENLY IT TURNED INTO A BRIGHT RED, BUT IT WAS IN AN OVAL LIKE FLASH. IT DID NOT COME OUT THE OTHERSIDE OF THE CLOUDS. I WOULD HAVE SEEN IT IF CHANGED COURSE, BECAUSE THE BASE IS HUGE. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT? I DIDN'T TELL ANY HIGHER UPS ABOUT IT, BECAUSE I'M NOT CRAZY!

August ,4, 2020, mid day, seen best with binoculars, a stationary angular object, reflecting the sun's light.;2020-08-04 11:00:00;1 hour;August ,4, 2020, mid day, seen best with binoculars, a stationary angular object, reflecting the sun's light. My husband was the first to spot it while he was resting on a chaise after some yardwork. Initially he thought it might be “floaters” in his eye, but then he was able to repeatedly see it even after looking away.  He called for me to come out and see.  The object appeared as a  star that was visible almost straight overhead, and about at 1:00 to the west.  It was 11:00AM on the morning of August 4, 2020.  We continued to observe it for at least an hour with initially our naked eye and then with two different pairs of binoculars.  It appeared to be reflecting the sun in a clear blue sky, not emitting its own source of light.  With the naked eye it appeared as a star.  With binoculars it took on an oblong shape, according to my husband. To me, it was oblong , but I could also  see some angles and an obvious red color at one end of the structure.  Once I told my husband that I clearly saw the red spot, he was able to also make it out to a degree ,though not as clear to him as it was to me. I almost think I was seeing an airplane like shape, with the red area being on the upper left, but being unable to keep the binoculars steady enough for long enough, I can’t be certain. It was pretty much stationary for the entire time. It may have meandered slightly as we had trouble finding it with our naked eye at one point, but when we finally did pick it out again, we were viewing it at a slightly different spot in our yard. Upon viewing it with the binoculars from this spot, the red area was more beneath the white  star. We called our neighbor over and he also observed it with his naked eye and then his own binoculars.;36.8754303754265;-76.2648143344713
