I was outside cutting the grass and cut of the lawn mower and went over to my porch and got something to drink. I looked up to see if there wee any clouds on the sky and noticed a disk shaped object it stayed there for about 2-4 minutes. I stood up and it began to go up and then all of a sudden it just shot straight up out of sight.;36.8754303754265;-76.2648143344713
Disk Shaped Object Observed in Storm Cloud Formation Over Norfolk, Virginia;2012-09-09 14:00:00;30 seconds;Disk Shaped Object Observed in Storm Cloud Formation Over Norfolk, Virginia strange gray disk shaped object flying east to west in storm cloud formation above Norfolk, Virginia.

I had the feeling the object or UFO was trying to avoid being seen as it consistently maneuvered into the cloud formation.  This object was observed from a moving vehicle (Car), Sunday September 9, 2012  between the hours of 2:30 pm-3:00 pm, sunday September 9, 2012.;36.8754303754265;-76.2648143344713
