A FLASH/BEAM OF LIGHT DIRECTLY OVERHEAD IN CLEAR SKY (NO SOUND)  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor.  PD));2009-03-29 22:00:00;3 SECONDS;A FLASH/BEAM OF LIGHT DIRECTLY OVERHEAD IN CLEAR SKY (NO SOUND) Me and my coworkers were working the night shift in Norfolk, VA, tonight and we stepped outside for a smoke.  We were in a small covered gazebo talking and laughing when we witnessed what we thought was a flash of lighting directly overhead (we heard nothing).  The weather is of concern to us because we are forecasters so we all stepped out of the covered area to see where the lightning could have come from.  There were almost clear skies and no storm clouds in any quadrants.  It could not have been lightning.  I went inside while to others headed to a lookout above the building where they claimed to have seen a ball of light in the distance take off out of sight in the blink of an eye.  I cannot confirm the second part but the first I was there for.  About 20 minutes after coming back into the office local news stations from Marland to North Carolina began reporting similar sightings.  Some interesting facts that occured just after the incident are millitary aircraft taking off and seemingly patroling the area. I later called the observation tower near the airfielf where I work and asked if they had witnessed anything and the lady said she could not confirm or deny anything at the moment.  It seemed by her tone that she had been told to say that for whatever that is worth. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  Possible meteor.  Several reports received.  PD));36.8754303754265;-76.2648143344713
Bright and super fast spot of light traveled 45 deg and then right straight up in the sky;2011-12-20 20:00:00;seconds;Bright and super fast spot of light traveled 45 deg and then right straight up in the sky I was walking out of the Naval Exchange store on the approximate date of Dec 20, 2011, around 8 pm at night and i looked up in the Southern sky and saw a very bright light travel from left to right at a 45 degree angle (lower to higher).  Then it went straight up at very fast rate of speed and disappeared.  There was no stoppage from moving 45 deg to going straight up.  It appeared as a very bright light off in the distance    There is a large Naval Airfield and USAF base in the area but I worked on Navy jet aircraft and spent my whole life in the aviation world and i have never seen anything travel this fast and make such a angular turn.   And it didnt fit in any aircraft traffic pattern for the bases and it was for sure not a flare.    As i said before i know aircraft very well and spend a lot of time in the aviation world and this event left me shaken that night.  Havent seen anything like it since. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));36.8754303754265;-76.2648143344713
Bright orange light traveling in sky without sound over Norfolk, VA 8/13/13;2013-04-13 20:15:00;20 minutes;Bright orange light traveling in sky without sound over Norfolk, VA 8/13/13 Driving home I noticed a bright orange light in the sky, we pulled over to the side of the road and it went directly over us without making any sound.  I could not see any shape as it was traveling.   There were two neighbors outside who also witnessed it.  We watched it travel into the distance until it disappeared.  Then within 5 minutes, getting back in our vehicle and only traveling to our home to park, which was one block away, we notice another one coming from the same direction the first came from, it looked exactly the same and took the same path as the first one. I video taped the second.;36.8754303754265;-76.2648143344713
Yellow Light magnitude = to Jupiter. Location: approx 5 Degress South of Vega/Altair (Mid) axis. I was taking;2013-07-13 21:45:00;5 minutes;9:45pm EST, July 13th 2013.  Yellow Light magnitude = to Jupiter. Locatio approx 5 Degress South of Vega/Altair (Mid) axis. I was taking our dog for his late evening trip outsiide.  Notice what I thought was a planet but knew there had been no planets in this area of the sky recently.  Our last trip out with our dog is alway plus or minus 30 min of 10pm. I took my eyes off the object for a few seconds to watch our dog and looked up anff focused on the light just as it departed in a curved upward angle of 1-2 on the clock dial and whisped out off sight with accelerating speed.  It was amazing.  I grew up in Florida in the late 50's thru Mid 70's.  As a youth was an avid fan of Nasa, Aviation, and Astronomy.  We lived within 15 miles of MacDill AFB. This was no jet's afterburner glow.  This was a craft of some type.  It had no audio signature.  Our 65lb Huskey was very excited for the next 45 minutes.;36.8754303754265;-76.2648143344713
Solid red light moving quickly through the sky and stopping to hover at irregular intervals;2017-08-12 21:45:00;~15 minutes;My fiancé and I witnessed a solid red light, moving quickly through the sky, and stopping to hover at irregular intervals.  The red light was bright and steady–not flashing/blinking like normal aircraft lights.  During one of the stopped/hovering moments, a greenish light began to intermittently blink on and off somewhat similar to aircraft light but with a slower transition between on/off. During one of its hovers, the red light seemed to split into 2 red lights, at which point the green strobing light was turned off.  A plane passed by in the general vicinity, but above the light, and it seemed to react by suddenly dropping altitude very quickly.  Once the plane had passed, the 2nd red light disappeared/turned off and the green strobe resumed.  The light then drifted slowly in the sky momentarily and then accelerated towards downtown Norfolk at about the speed of a helicopter until it was out of sight. It could have possibly been a drone but the abnormal flight behavior, time of night, speed and distance covered made me skeptical of that. It’s hard to estimate the altitude of the light, however it was well below the clouds and normal flight paths of aircraft in the area.

Norfolk Naval Base UFO sighting.;2019-04-04 06:55:00;1 minute;Norfolk Naval Base UFO sighting Was pulling into the parking lot near the piers on Norfolk Naval base.  I glanced out my window (looking south) and seen what appeared to be a shooting star, but it never diminished or faded away.  It looked like a white tic tac and had a greenish glow and short tail behind the object and was moving silently and quick (500mph +) across the sky.  It went from over the piers to out of sight in less than 10 seconds.  Pulled out my phone and captured a video, but it's not visible on the replay and I don't have special programs to enhance the video.;36.8754303754265;-76.2648143344713
Extremely loud bang, light spotted in sky.;2019-05-08 23:00:00;>10 minutes;Extremely loud bang, light spotted in sky. My girlfriend and I were laying in bed and heard this extremely loud boom noise.  Was looking outside to see if I saw a car accident due to the noise sounding very close.  Looked in the sky and say a glowing light moving left to right in an almost perfect semi circle.  The speed changed as the craft moved and at times it would almost look like it was just hovering.  During breaks in the clouds you could see that the light was brighter, but then would go behind cloud cover again.;36.8754303754265;-76.2648143344713
Bright star like object seen in the sky winks out of existence;2019-10-27 20:00:00;2 minutes;Bright star like object seen in the sky winks out of existence I was out in my front lawn taking out the trash of which I was looking up at the sky at the constellations as I usually do when I am out.  I noticed a very bright light in the sky that looked to me like Jupiter however it was in the wrong spot.  At first I was thinking it could be a drone or something but it was above the clouds and their appeared to be a couple of planes flying in the same vicinity as well.  After a minute or so the light just blinked out as if a light switch was turned off and then there was nothing there.;36.8754303754265;-76.2648143344713
