Triangle shaped;2012-02-23 03:30:00;1 minute or less;Triangle shaped Was taking my dog out and saw a v-formation overhead a few hundred feet up.  At first I thought that it was a classic geese or duck flying formation as one of the sides even seemed to collapse momentarily.  The factors which changed my mind was that there seemed to be lights coming off of the formation. There was absolutely no noise coming from this object on a perfectly quiet morning.  There was a good southerly tail wind that morning and the object seemed to pick up speed as I continued watching it.;36.8754303754265;-76.2648143344713
