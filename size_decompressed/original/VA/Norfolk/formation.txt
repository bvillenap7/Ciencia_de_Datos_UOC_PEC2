V-formation seen over Norfolk, Virginia.;2015-03-18 23:44:00;12 seconds;V formation seen over Norfolk, Virginia I went outside for a cigarette.  Looked up to the stars like I always do.  I thought it was a wisp of cloud moving, but as I kept watching it was a formation of white dots moving across the sky.  I kept watching to count about 20 of these white star-like points of light.  They were moving in a loose line but as i watched i could count two next to each other as they slowly moved closer in to a distinct V formation.  At some points it was hard to count them because it looked as if they over lapped.   The formation moved at an accelerated airplane speed.  I was facing North-North-East as they moved North-North-West.   After about 12 seconds they disappeared out of side over a tree and far away.  From my 60 degree angle it appeared that they were closer to to the Norfolk Naval Base as i did not see them over-head.  If this was a flock of geese i dont know why it was so easy to spot them and why they were lit up.;36.8754303754265;-76.2648143344713
