Cylindrical object with green and pink flash of light...;2012-04-12 20:15:00;20:15;Cylindrical object with green and pink flash of light... At approximately 20:15 Eastern Standard Time I was driving with my Son in a northward direction and at the intersection of Abingdon Circle and Chesapeake Blvd.   At about 40 degrees in the air directly in front of us we saw a dark cylindrical object moving from our right to left.  The object had 5 even lights horizontally with a sudden giant flash of green light changing into pink and the object transformed into a triangular shape and disappeared.  The entire event was approximately 2 seconds.;36.8754303754265;-76.2648143344713
