Two or three lights shoot across sky over naval base!;2013-09-09 00:15:00;Split second;Two or three lights shoot across sky over naval base! I took my pup to go outside last night and I was admiring how I could see the sky through all the light pollution n all of sudden there was a two maybe three white lights that literally shot out of nowhere.  Now I would say it's a comet or meteor but I've seen those n thier a hell of alot slower.  This thing practically warped to the other side of the sky in a split sec but there was no tail no sound nothing but some lights.  Also, I happen to live a stones throw away from the naval base.  Like gate 4 is in my backyard. But as soon as I saw that I grabbed my dog n ran in.  As for myself I adore watching the shows on tv about this stuff but I can't be seeing that in real life, way to real for me lol;36.8754303754265;-76.2648143344713
Bright light moving along the sky heading 57 degrees NE.;2019-03-23 19:59:00;2 minutes;Bright light moving along the sky heading 57 degrees NE. Saturday, March 23rd, 7:59 pm, Norfolk, VA. A bright white light slowly passing over my house heading 57 degrees NE. The light was very high in the sky.  Possibly higher than an airplane could go but I am not too sure.  I could not see any FAA lights, wings, or anything, for that matter, other than a very bright light, moving somewhat fast in the sky, for how high up it was.;36.8754303754265;-76.2648143344713
Loud, hovering oscillating never heard before sound.;2019-08-05 03:00:00;3-5 minutes;Loud, hovering oscillating never heard before sound. Heard an oscillating sound that sounded like it was coming from outside hovering around my neighborhood for a few minutes.  I didn't get to see anything, but this was like nothing I've ever heard before.  It was really loud at one point and then proceeded to grow more distant as it went away.  Immediately after, I heard a jet like sound fly over.;36.8754303754265;-76.2648143344713
