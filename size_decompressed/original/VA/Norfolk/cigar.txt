glowing needle over norfolk va;2004-08-06 20:00:00;5 min;glowing needle over norfolk va my 3 year old daughter is the one who noticed it.  it was so high in the sky that i would have never noticed it.  the sky was clear there was a rainbow on the opposite side of the sky.  i was in a parking lot, and was going to grab someone to show them but thought its so high if i point they may not notice it, so i just stared at it in amazement. i asked my daughter what she thought it was.. her responce its like a little tinker bell  my description.. i was so high it was like a glowing white needle flying thought the sky.. (i picked cigar as a shape but it was more like a needle?) i watched it till it was so far my eye couldnt see it any more...i sort of forgot about it.. till i was watching tv and saw some ufo special and they showed video tape of a craft some guy recorded over colorodo, and it looked just like what i saw...oh and a regular airplane flew by and it gave me a better feeling of how high it was....
