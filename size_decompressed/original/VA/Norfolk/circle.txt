It was midnight and we were driving on Northhampton Blvd and saw what looked like a green luminous round object that had a dark vertical line (or absense of light) it appeared to be falling or descending it disappeared after being visible for about 10 seconds. It never reappeared.;36.8754303754265;-76.2648143344713

I was walking my dog last night when I turned around facing north east and noticed about 8 amber lights in the night sky that were scattered yet in a rough formation.  These objects were so noticeable and obvious I literally noticed them out of the corner of my eye while looking towards my dog on the ground.  I immediately pulled out my iPhone and began to video tape what I saw.  As I video taped I noticed that the objects were not completely stationary but were very slowly moving in what appeared to be my direction (sw) yet increasing in altitude at the same time.  They can be best described as amber colored, yet bigger and closer than (in earths atmosphere) regular stars in the sky that moved very slowly.  As I filmed I noticed they would move closer towards me, gain altitude and they would randomly fade out one by one.  As they were fading below them through the trees I kept seeing more appear sometimes 2-3 at a time that were much brighter at they're lower alt! itudes and seemed to fade as they climbed in altitude.  These objects made absolutely no sounds, and moved in no erratic motions, yet didn't have any characteristics of any man made aircraft I have ever witnessed.  In all I saw/video taped around 20-25 of these at first bright glowing objects that would eventually fade away and be replaced by more almost immediately.;36.8754303754265;-76.2648143344713
~50 bright tiny light steadily moving to same direction NE to SW.;2014-01-04 18:00:00;30 minutes;~50 bright tiny light steadily moving to same direction NE to SW i watched them move very steadily for at least 30 minutes.  They were not combustion engine, it was dead quiet.  Closest thing comes to mind is satellites, but why 50 of them following each other?  They were far away, above the clouds.  I live next to a huge naval base and they chemical spray here all day everyday,  My bet is to cloud the sky so we can't see, plus the negative health effects of course.  I don't drink, smoke nor use drugs.;36.8754303754265;-76.2648143344713

The boat was doing work ups getting ready for deployment, we had a full deployment crew. Me and a couple of other ET's heard some of the watch standers on the island talking about seeing something crazy, they said something about trying lock on to it with the Nato Sea Sparrow Director's onto the object.  Me and a handful of guys on the night shift ran up to the O-10 where the watch standers were watching it.  They had the mounted Binoculars trained on the object.  I thought they were mistaking two stars one of which looked like a pulsar (due to my pretty extensive knowledge of astronomy).  The object then appeared between the two stars again, the other guys saw the object as well.  We all thought we might be imagining it, asked each other a couple of times if they saw it too.  We all agreed that it was there. When I first noticed it, I thought I was imagining it.  How could a star disappear then reappear right in front of me?  I watched it through the mounted binoculars changing colors between blue, white, purple, and pink at high speed, it kept pulsing. It seemed to stay motionless, the problem was that the altitude was just high for any of us to make out exactly what it looked like, from our vantage point we could see that it may have been hovering and possibly moving but just can't say for sure.   After about 5 minutes of viewing the object as we were all trying to get a look at it, a bright flash filled the sky in the location of the object, it looked like it shot with an incredible speed and was gone.  We were traveling North, the object was northeast of our Northerly heading.  Our speed was approximately 15 to 20 knots. The three watch standers at there post reported that two similar objects had come out of the main relatively stationary object and then rejoined the main object. During my time watching the object CIC (Combat Information Center) was trying to get a radar lock on the object with the Nato Sea Sparrow Missile Directors.  The directors (which are radar directors, fire control radar) kept trying to lock onto the object then it would drop back down to the horizon, the OS's (Operation Specialists) trying to drive the director back there again.  Every time they would drive to get a lock the lock would fail and the director would be driven back down again.  It seemed to me that the object was overriding the directors drive control or that the radar receiver was being over powered and being forced by internal programming to protect its receiver, (to get away from the source of the electromagnetic radiation) it could have been over-driven by the object being to close but more than likely the object was jamming the radar.  I can't say weather it was jamming the object passively or actively, just that the radar was being jammed. After the sighting I checked the SPN-43 and SPS-49 radar in CATCC, neither of them had a radar return, although at that altitude the chances of a radar return are very slim. I tried to report it to my chain of command, they laughed at me and said that we didn't see anything.  We probably just excited, I didn't expect that reaction especially when CIC reacted the way they did.;36.8754303754265;-76.2648143344713
