Visible for 3 seconds or less Was getting out of my truck on Boissevain Avenue in Norfolk, Va. and was facing North when the event occured.  Saw the brightest object I have ever seen in the sky except for the sun.  It was a bright green fireball with a tail that was extremely long of the same color. I have seen many meteors/meteorites in my 50 years but never anything to equal this.  It was a dark evening and I was on a well lit city street.  Will send you a sketch if desired.;36.8754303754265;-76.2648143344713

The stationary object was a very bright reddish orange color, the other appeared to be red.  They were very bright and almost looked like there was fire inside of them.   The stationary object started moving to the right and closer to us about the same time the one that was initially moving started gaining altitude and eventually disappeared.    Then we saw a third light that looked to be shot off the ground and to the left, gaining altitude very quickly..it initially looked yellow but when it got up close to the other it appeared to be the same red/orange color.   They both started moving to the right, gaining altitude and disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Saw what seemed like a something on fire shooting thru the sky with a trail.  ((anonymous report));2018-11-17 04:05:00;30-45 seconds;Came out of HRBT towards Hampton and saw what seemed like a something on fire shooting thru the sky with a trail.  About 10 sec the trail diminished and it was just a red ball of light.  It then faded out but about a minute later the light reappeared but was smaller.  I could tell it was traveling away from me.
