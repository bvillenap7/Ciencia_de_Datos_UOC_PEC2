UFOs spotted on I-264 into Norfolk VA;2010-12-18 10:30:00;30 seconds;UFOs spotted on I-264 into Norfolk VA A and I friend were driving on I-264 from Portsmouth to Norfolk to catch I-464 to Chesapeake when he pointed out 3 objects in the air to our left with the city of Norfolk on the immediate horizon.  I joked before I actually looked.  When I did look, I could not identify what these were.  There were three black/metallic objects hovering mid air and rotating at a very high rate of speed on their horizontal axis.  The objects were large in size and unlike anything I ever seen before.  The objects were also in a very tight formation.  Other cars noticed the objects, as there were brake lights illuminated in great number ahead of us.  My vision of the objects became obscured by trees for a matter of three seconds.  The objects were gone. It took us about another 5 seconds to relocate the objects which were now directly over downtown Norfolk, but now were 4 in number.   I watched for another 5 seconds and the objects... for lack of a better description zoomed away at a VER! Y high rate of speed.;36.8754303754265;-76.2648143344713
