Very distant, like watching a satellite cross the night sky. They were in a cluster when I first saw them then a minute or so later dispersed in all directions. The kind of zigzagged with extremely quick movements. Later one returned to the same sky and would move quickly one direction to the next and then stopped then seemed to disappear.;37.5414;-79.1703
