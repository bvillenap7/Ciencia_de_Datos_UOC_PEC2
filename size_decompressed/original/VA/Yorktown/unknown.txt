At first they just looked like a tower with lights suspended from it but as we drove right under it, I could not see any connections.   From my observation all the lights were moving together in a manner that the they seemed attached to one object. Since we were driving the round disk of yellow orange lights at first seemed to just hover, but I could tell it was slow in moving  west to north west towards Camp Perry. I could not tell the speed if any cause of its slow movement, and due to driving directly under it.;37.1468142857143;-76.4602979591837
