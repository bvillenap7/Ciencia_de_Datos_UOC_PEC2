4 dimly lit circles going southeast, no sound, no blinking lights, clear night, duration about 15 secounds;2008-11-17 20:23:00;15 seconds;4 dimly lit circles going southeast, no sound, no blinking lights, clear night, duration about 15 secounds Crisp, clear night.Four dimly lit circles came from the north heading southeast in a diamond formation. About 5 seconds into the sighting they changed positions into a line with three in a row and the trailing circle in an offset and then quickly back into the diamond formation.There is alot of air traffic in my area so iam used to all kinds of aircraft at all sorts of altitudes and you can hear them unless they happen to be flying at 30 to 40 thousand feet.These objects made no sound at all.The color and brightness can best be described as what you would see if light was seen through a brown paper bag,not very bright.If there were clouds that night what I saw could very easily be written off as a reflection from some source but not that night.Also I could not see anything solid between the circles as in a larger object.;37.1468142857143;-76.4602979591837

Yorktown Beach on 6-15-12 we saw 5 or 6 lights flying seperately in the sky;2012-06-15 19:30:00;30 min;Yorktown Beach on 6-15-12 we saw 5 or 6 lights flying seperately in the sky We were at Yorktown Beach on 6-15-12.  The sun went down but the sky was still blue.  I looked up and saw one light very high in the sky.  The one light hovered and then in the blink of an eye there was another on beside it.  The two lights then flew over each other and went in opposite directions.  We watched them disappear into the distance and then in the original spot another light appeared.   This light hovered and appeared to swing back and forth and then moved away and disappeared.  Then another light appeared it hovered without moving and we watched until the light went completely out. It just went out like a light switch.  It was the brightest light of all lights we saw and when it went out we were amazed.  About a minute later we saw one more light hovering lower than the previous lights but it too just disappeared.  We had not been drinking or smoking anything and there were no clouds in the sky and there were no stars yet. The sky was still blue.;37.1468142857143;-76.4602979591837
