Bright Light with something beneath it, moving briskly south-south-east, absolutely silent,;2019-01-08 06:35:00;5 seconds;Bright Light with something beneath it, moving briskly south-south-east, absolutely silent, I was on my way to school in the morning with my father, I stopped at the intersection right by the Yorktown Naval Weapons Station, we came to a stop, and right after we saw a bright light moving across our sightline.  I looked up just in time to see it for about 5 seconds or so, then it started moving South-South-East towards the Deer Run Golf Course.  It moved rather quickly, about 200mph or so.   My friend, who lives near where the object was heading also noted the object and repeated the same sight that I did.  It was perfectly silent.   One other oddity is my recollection of the event, I only know the basics of what happened,   I'm sorry that I can't provide more details to the event, and hope this can assist you.  If you need to get in contact with me, please email me, it is the quickest way for me to respond.;37.1468142857143;-76.4602979591837
