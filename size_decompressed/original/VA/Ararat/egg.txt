A huge house size football shaped object appeared out of the cloud.  ((MUFON CMS REPORT));2019-07-31 21:15:00;Seconds;Witness was on the way home from work.  The sighting was about 1/2 mile on Squirrel Creek Road coming in from the Squirrel Spur Rd end.  Witness saw a large dense cloud hovering in the sky after witnessing what looked like lightening inside the cloud!  A huge house size football shaped object appeared out of the cloud. It had bright lights all around it.  It hovered for a few seconds with no sound or motion.  It was just sitting there. Then all of a sudden it turned and went backwards at light speed and disapeared in thin air.  It was like it was using the cloud as cover and the cloud moved unexpectedly leaving it exposed!  Witness has never witnessed anything like this before and was left puzzled and very shaken. (MUFON CMS);36.6151;-80.5138
