He said, Honey, look out the window, do you see what I see?   I looked, a little blurry eyed at first, but I saw a rectangular shape, over the mountains, behind our house.  It was colored like fire.  After a few seconds it started to dim, and disappeared.   Then I saw some light flashes and then a round globe, smoke colored object sort of bounced through the sky.  We discussed the fact that no one would believe us.;36.6151;-80.5138
