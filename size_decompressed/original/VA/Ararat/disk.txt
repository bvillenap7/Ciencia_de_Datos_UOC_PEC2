UFO in trouble has mothership support but recovers, then both fly off .;2003-08-03 13:00:00;2 or 3 minutes;UFO in trouble has mothership support but recovers, then both fly off . I was sitting on my back porch,which is at the foot of the blue ridge mountains,talking on the phone and watching the airline jets . I noticed a round hazy looking object that I first thought was a jet, that was going twice as fast as the other traffic in the air, suddenly it had a vapor trail which went on and off 4 times. I told the person I was on the phone with that i think a jet just blew a engine, then I noticed a glimmer of metal in the direction the craft was headed, I saw a very large saucer shaped craft desending at 50 degree angle and stop in mid air ,i believe a dozen airline size planes could have sat on its disc , the round craft flew under it and turned 90 degrees and flew out past the large craft and headed up till it went out of sight, then the saucer backed up from the way it came still at that 50 degree angle till i lost sight of it. no detail for the small craft but the big one was huge i've watched planes fly thur there for 20 years its surface appeared to be metal thin for its size with a bulged area in the center, I was raised on USAF base, and worked as a law enforcement officer, there was other flight traffic in the area at the time of this sighting, I never told anyone but my family and I could tell it was hard for them to accept so I remained silent, till now.
