((anonymous report));2019-07-31 21:15:00;3 minutes;I was on my way home from work around 9:15 pm on Wednesday July 31st. The sighting was about 1/2 mile on Squirrel Creek Road in Ararat, VA, coming in from the Squirrel Spur Rd end. I saw a large dense cloud hovering in the sky after witnessing what looked like lightening inside the cloud!  A huge house size football shaped object appeared out of the cloud.  It had bright lights all around it.  It hovered for a few seconds with no sound or motion. It was just sitting there. Then all of a sudden it went backwards at light speed and disapeared in thin air.  It was like it was using the cloud as cover and the cloud moved unexpectedly leaving it exposed! I have never witnessed anything like this before in my whole life.  It left me puzzled and very shaken!;36.6151;-80.5138
