Unseen object, ,effects felt.;2001-11-29 01:00:00;1 minute;Unseen object, ,effects felt. I was in bed and I couldn't sleep so rather than keeping mu boyfriend up, I went to try to sleep on the couch. I was sitting on the couch with my eyes closed and I was not asleep. I heard a humming sound that grew louder and all of the sudden the room was filled with white light. I couldn't pinpoint the source of the light and the humming seemed to be everywhere, not just coming from one direction. This lasted for about a minute before I was able to get up and look outside. When I did look outside the light was gone. I told my boyfriend about this and he told me a about a time about 20 years ago when his sister lived up in a hollar just above his house. She called him late one night, she was crying and her children were crying also. She told him to come up there because there was a spaceship (her exact word) hovering above her house. This is a very mountainous region of Virginia and I don't know if anybody else saw anything or not. I'm looking forward to the next update on your page to see if anybody else reported anything. Personal note to the NUFORC staff. This story was relayed by my mother-in-law and, as you can see, I told the story in the first person to make it more understandable.;36.8254;-81.5391
