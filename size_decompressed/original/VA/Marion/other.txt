It looked like it was made of a hard metal.  It was not completely round but not square either.  It was more like an octagon shape.  It had colorful lights on the belly of it.  There was about four of us girls standing outside smoking cigarettes and my sister just happened to look up and see it.  It was going really slow and it made no sound.  We watched it until it went out of sight and kept up with it as far as we could.  I yelled to some other girls to come see it and one girl came over and got just a glimpse of it before it went out of sight into the horizon.  It stayed just above the trees and just before it appeared all the lights in the town went out.  All of us girls were raised pretty much normal.  We all were alittle bit mischievous.  We experimented with marijuana sometimes and alcohol but thatâ€™s it.  We were at the Job Corp at the time.  My background includes being manic depressive and at the time w! as on medication for it.  I was always wanting to see a ufo ever since my cousin saw an alien when she was about 13 at her home in strange creek, WV. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.
