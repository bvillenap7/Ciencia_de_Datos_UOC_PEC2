Around 1a.m. we noticed the street light from outside the east window was actually coming in through the south window. Like it wrapped around the house before it came in. When we looked out the east window we saw an object several feet high rounded on top but flat across the bottom floating along the ground moving between houses. I remember that Barbara and I looked at each other and then went into a type of trance. All I know is that some time passed. In the morning we woke up as though nothing had happened. We didn't speak of it at all until about a week later. All I said to her was,Did you... and she said ,yes. even before I said anything. We never spoke any more of it. All my life I have had encounters, but this seems to be the first so obvious one. It seems to be a brief event in my conscious memory. Barbara and I were around 13 or 14 years old. What I wrote above is about all I can say about this particular incident, although I have had numerous other encounters. This is the only one that I am absolutely positive happened as there was another wittness, and I know what I saw.;38.9418725352112;-77.1918873239437
Three balls of light (BOLs), bobbing in circular formation, seen in midafternoon low over homes .;2005-05-10 15:00:00;One Minute;Three balls of light (BOLs), bobbing in circular formation, seen in midafternoon low over homes . I'm belatedly reporting, only having recently found out about this website.  On May 10, 2005, approximately 3:00pm, in the courtyard behind my townhouse in McLean, VA, I witnessed three balls of white, hovering over my home.  It was the day before fighter jets were dispatched in DC to intercept a civilian aircraft--very much in that days news at the time, which had intruded into restricted Washingtion air space.  One of these jets also flew low over my home.  I have since learned the objects I saw are referred to as balls of light or BOLs. I was gardening and happened to look up at the very blue sky to the right of my chimney...south. I saw three small balls, more like three round white puffs, not illuminated from within...that I could tell...but just reflecting sun light.  At the time my estimate of their altitude was approximately 100 feet. They were bobbing around one another in a circular pattern the formation was staying stationary.  Quickly after spotting them, and as if they realized I had noticed them, one shot off to the northeast, going behind my chimney and again becoming visible on the other side.  If the object was at 100 feet, I estimate the speed at 50-60 mph...the day was sunny and rather calm. This object, slightly bobbing, but moving in a straight line, quickly moved out of sight behind trees and other townhouses. When I turned my eyes back to the other two, they were also gone, obviously in different directions from the first.  The objects I saw were much the same as the BOLs I've seen on television of lights taped over crop circles.  Their bobbing movements were also similar.;38.9418725352112;-77.1918873239437
