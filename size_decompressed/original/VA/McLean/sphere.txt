Was object a UFO or Stealth Bomber following 747;2008-11-28 11:30:00;3 minutes;Was object a UFO or Stealth Bomber following 747 After I went outside about 10-11 am in the morning to smoke a cigarette, and looked up in the air, I saw a large jet with what looked like a disk immediately below the tail, and keeping speed with it. I followed it with my eyes for several minutes. Later, I went inside to look for the number of the FAA. I called the number I found, and the woman I talked to emphatically denied that is what I saw, and suggested that I was seeing things. After I went back outside after talking to her, I looked up and the disc, or whatever it was that was under the 747 was going in reverse direction in a straight line above my neighborhood, where it had originally appeared with the 747 jet, at about 20,000 feet, it was a mostly clear day with a few scattered clouds. After I talked to several others about this event, they suggested that what I saw was a stealth bomber below Air Force One. This seemed to be a very logical explanation.The disc was dark and round shaped and small enough to be noticed below tail of this aircraft. The FAA was never recontacted about this and would possibly deny the presence of a second plane (object) at all, if that is what I saw. I hope someone else out there sees them too one day, and gets some good pictures. There are helicopter and planes above my area all the time, day and night, and I am just west of Arlington, VA.;38.9418725352112;-77.1918873239437
