Our rifles fire the 50 caliber cartridge developed for the Browning 50 caliber machine gun. A couple of CIA employees attended our last meeting and told us not to fire at silent triangular shaped aircraft if we see any and are surprised by them because they are USAF stealth aircraft with UFO technology obtained from crashed UFOs. ((NUFORC Note:  The source of this message provides no contact information, so we cannot confirm the assertions made above.  However, we have elected to post the message, nevertheless, principally because we strongly recommend against discharging a firearm of ANY caliber at a suspected UFO, irrespective of whatever that craft's origin may be.  This fact seems to us to be nothing more than common sense, and it does not require a high-level security clearance to figure out.  Moreover, it is inappropriate to discharge a firearm at any target but one which is deemed to be safe.  PD/NRA Home Firearm Safety Instructor #76715440.));38.9418725352112;-77.1918873239437
