When I looked over i saf a craft, small, at high altitude with one moderatly bright, blueish light in front, and a smaller, dimmer redish light in back.  as it flew over, most likely very high speed given the approximate altitude and duration, gave out low sounds, almost like the sounds whales make when signing, or like the sound that metal makes under high stress, like in a ship's hull, when bending.  As it flew over the horizon i heard these sounds, maybe 3 or 4 times in slow succession. The night was cold (35* F.) and clear, with light whispy clouds in the SSE direction.  The craft was flying ESE and I could see it from the time it came over the horizon, to the time The trees in the backround obstructed it.;38.9418725352112;-77.1918873239437
