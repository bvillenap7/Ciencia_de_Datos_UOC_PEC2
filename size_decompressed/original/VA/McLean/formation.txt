On January 24, 2014, I was walking my dog down my street.  I look up and see a light formation.  I thought it was a plane, but it was moving too fast to be one.   I run to get my camara and I come out to see it moved across the sky.  I look at it closer and it seemed to have 7 or more lights.   The formation then started to move around very unusually.  The lights were yellow and the formation seemed to have two sides.   I have never seen anything like this. I am 15 years old and my brother, 17, saw the same thing too.   I have glasses, but I can still see things if they are close.   I have no idea what this object could be.;38.9418725352112;-77.1918873239437
