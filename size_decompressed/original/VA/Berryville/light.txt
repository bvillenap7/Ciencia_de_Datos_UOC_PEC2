Facing east, with the sun just set behind me, I had just got out of my car when I noticed an extremely light high in the sky almost directly overhead at approximately 80 to 85 degrees.   Moving north to south, it was moving at a pretty fast clip, but much too slow or large to be a meteor (no tail either), and it appeared much higher in the sky than any of the other aircraft (of which there were at least 4 that I noticed).  The sky was clear and with the sun having just set I initially thought the brightness was just a satellite reflecting the sun, but as it moved from south to north it dimmed, and in under a minute was completely gone.  I stood watching the sky for a few more minutes in case the light returned, but nothing was visible again along the object's path during the next 5 minutes.;39.1578;-77.9772
