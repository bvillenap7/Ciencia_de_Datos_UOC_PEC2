Stationary row of lights in the sky in daylight;2020-08-18 17:45:00;1 minute;Stationary row of lights in the sky in daylight My wife and I were at a stoplight, we look to our right (southeast) and see what appears to be a row of about eight super bright lights tightly packed together in a straight line. It was stationary and in plain sight about 1,500 feet off the ground.  We stared at it for about 90 seconds never seeing it budge from it's spot in the sky. The traffic light turned green, prompting us to turn left. I made a u-turn about 150 feet down the road and once we were facing back towards where we saw it, we no longer find anything in the sky anywhere for the next 5 minutes. Also, I don't know if it is worth mentioning, but I did see a few interesting cloud formations that stood out and seemed out of place near by.;38.7332;-77.5495000000001
