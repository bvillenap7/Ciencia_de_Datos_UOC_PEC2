Triangular shaped UFOs with red and blue lights arranged in a triangle pattern.;2015-12-03 20:05:00;1 minute;Triangular shaped UFOs with red and blue lights arranged in a triangle pattern. My daughter and I were driving north on route 288 when we saw in the distance 3 sets of Red and Blue lights hovering in the sky in a triangle formation.  As we got closer we could clearly see the individual units were also triangle shaped, black with Red and blue lights and they hovered at equal distance from each other.  They were quite large and were about 100 feet above ground level (best guess).  We were in disbelief and I told her quick take a picture.  She turned around and tried to take a picture out the window and they were gone.  I looked in the rear view mirrors and they were gone..  Just vanished.;37.3740708333333;-77.5857875
