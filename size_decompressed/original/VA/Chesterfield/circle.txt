Circular object with round lights hovering above the intersection of Qualla Road and Newby’s bridge Road in Chesterfield County.;1988-06-01 23:30:00;2-3 minutes;Circular object with round lights hovering above the intersection of Qualla Road and Newby’s bridge Road in Chesterfield County. My father and I were coming back from the bowling alley and came up on the stop sign at Qualla Road and Newby’s Bridge Road.  The stop sign had not been there long as there used to be no 4-way stop there prior.   As we pulled up to the sign, we noticed a bright light coming through the windshield from above.  As there is no street light there, we both immediately looked up through the windshield.  We saw a circular object of some type with round lights going around the object.  The object hovered just above the trees up at an angle.   I didn’t hear any noise whatsoever as my window was down because it was nice out that summer evening.   My father and I remained staring up through the windshield, looking up at the lights.   I don’t remember ever saying a word during the incident at what we were witnessing at the time, but instead just staring at it.   Without any kind of notice or trail of any type, the ship just vanished before my eyes.  It was the strangest thing I had ever seen.   To this day no one believes my father and me when we talk about it.  However, I will never forget that day.

strange blinking light(s);2003-12-20 20:00:00;1 hour;strange blinking light(s) The first day I saw them was december the 20th I was sitting in my computer room then my mom told me to come here. She pointed to a blinking light in the sky so at first I thought it was just some kind of star, Then it moved. So my mom ,my brother ,and I  went into the field behind my house and looked at it through binoculars and saw that it consisted of three colors red,blue, and white, and was a bit larger than the other stars. Then The next day we went to look to see if it was there. What we saw was strange. Not one large light, but three different lights split apart from each other one red, one blue, and one white. Just to note they formed a triangle. ((NUFORC Note:  Description is not inconsistent with a sighting of a twinkling star, we believe.  PD));37.3740708333333;-77.5857875
