Four orange objects flying in a semi formation with four witness;2013-09-28 21:30:00;5 minutes;Four orange objects flying in a semi formation with four witness Sitting on our back porch last night at 9:30 pm my wife my self and a friend saw a large orange light.  Flying slowly at about the height and speed of a helicopter it flew off to the north west followed by two more identical craft.  As the moved off they slowly  blinked out.  The last craft with the same description flew a slightly different pattern and blinked out at a much different point.  There was no sound they did not blink there was no additional lights just solid orange.  when we told our son about it this morning he said he saw them too. He was spending the night at a friends in the neighborhood.  To test him I asked how many he saw.  He said four.  We are just normal folks.  We all work retail it was just a really cool expereance.;37.3740708333333;-77.5857875
Multi color lights light up the night sky and temporary disable radio.;2018-09-15 01:30:00;10 seconds;Multi color lights light up the night sky and temporary disable radio. While driving home at 1:30am on September 15th I saw one bright flash of white light that lit up the entire night sky white.  The car radio then went to static so I assumed lightning had struck a radio tower, but then the entire night sky, absolutely all of it, lit up bright red for 5 seconds then bright blue for about one second and then another bright white flash.   After the final white light the radio came back on and no other lights after that.  I can’t think of any man made light source that could light up the entire sky that intense, and I regularly drive past airports that project light into the night sky but nowhere near that amount.   This happened on a highway passes by mostly residential neighborhoods and at least 10 miles from even the smallest airport let alone the  large one on the other side of Richmond City.   By the way, I was listening to Coast to Coast Am at the time.;37.3740708333333;-77.5857875

I would say it was closer than any other object I have seen in the sky before like airplanes or shooting stars.  It fell slowly and then disappeared into the darkness in the blink of an eye after about 5-7 seconds.  Me and my husband were in awe and excited to have witnessed this!  Sad we were not able to get pictures in time.;37.3740708333333;-77.5857875
