four objects passing over chesterfield;2010-06-01 22:00:00;2hrs;four objects passing over chesterfield I went out side to smoke a cigarette and I see what looks like a star but is moving across the sky like a airplane. I figure it's a satellite because it looks quite high and watch it for about 5 minutes. After clearing about half the sky overhead it emits a brilliant white light light making it appear to grow 50x in size, its about the size of a quarter from my perspective now. it fades in over about 3 seconds, remains lit for about 3 more than fades out over 3 back to its original star like appearance  soon as i see the light i run inside and get my brother and he sees it flying too. then he spots another one following it back where the first started. the second one fades out half way across the sky and is gone. the first continues on its path and i see a smaller orange object do a half orbit around it in about one second, it then parks on the other side of the sky and another orange object does a half orbit the same way. for the next 2 hours possibly longer Its still sitting there doing nothing special. I checked on it a few times before going to bed  I would have loved to take images of this but all I have is a camera phone that could have maybe caught the glowing action in horrible quality;37.3740708333333;-77.5857875
Object with blinking lights hovering in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a sighting of a twinkling star.  PD));2014-04-21 23:00:00;30 minutes;Object with blinking lights hovering in the sky In the late evening hours over the last few nights, we have seen an object in the sky with colored flashing lights.  The object hovers around in a single spot before slowly moving.  At times object appears to have been “bouncing” in the sky.   Obviously not an airplane as it was just hovering for awhile with no noise coming from it. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a sighting of a twinkling star.  PD));37.3740708333333;-77.5857875
