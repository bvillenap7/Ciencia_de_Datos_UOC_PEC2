A star that skowly but surely changed its position near the moon.;2002-05-16 00:00:00;10minutes+;A star that skowly but surely changed its position near the moon. On a clear but slightly hazy night (Thursday) I went out on my deck to see planets that the channel 4 meterologist said were near the moon.  Immediately below and to the right of the moon there was a bright star. The star appeared to slowly but surely changfe its position -- drifting aimlessly. Since it was twilight, I checked another bright star 90 degrees to the right of the moonfor comparison purposed. It did not move but the bright star near the moon continued to move. I then called 911 and reported this to Mr. Davenport. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, who sounded quite credible.  We believe that one possibility that would have to be ruled out is one of the planets in the proximity of the Moon.  Also, another possibility would be the landing light on an aircraft in the distance.  If those two possibilities could be eliminated, then we do not know what the witness observed.

Stationary light (flashing red, yellow, and blue) in north-east sky;2002-09-07 23:45:00;1 hour +;Stationary light (flashing red, yellow, and blue) in north-east sky A flashin light appeared. At first we thought it might be an airplane, but it was not moving, it was stationay in the north-east corner of the sky. We then saw something to the left of the flashing light which was dark and flying around. The a similar flashing light appeared in the left corner, this light was smaller though. Another smaller similar light appeared to the right of the first light. The light is flasin red, yellow, and blue. We first spotted the object at 11:45 p.m., and it is still present in the sky, the time is now 12:50 a.m. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

10 Redish orange lights not blinking near Dulles Airport Sterling VA. 20:25 till 20:34 12/27/13.;2013-12-27 20:27:00;11 minutes;10 Redish orange lights not blinking near Dulles Airport Sterling VA.  20:25 till 20:34 12/27/13 On clear night on 12/27/2013 starting at 20:25 in Sterling VA.  I turned on to the street  where I live and before me I saw a string of ten orangish red lights that looked like Christmas lights hanging in the sky in a zig zag pattern.  They were due south of me. They were close to the landing pattern of Dulles Airport.  I picked up my phone and called my wife to come out and see what was going on.  They slowly move off to the east (over  Dulles Airport), getting dimmer and slowly disappearing. These were not from a meteor that was braking up. They moved too slowly.  The air planes that were landing at Dulles had to notice them.  They seemed to be flying around them. Wife saw them also.;39.0162333333333;-77.422037356322

Single point-source of light flying due north, changes direction to due east, then disappears suddenly.;2017-11-27 19:45:00;5 minutes;Single point-source of light flying due north, changes direction to due east, then disappears suddenly. At approximately 7:45 PM EST, I saw a single point-source of light traveling due north near my house, approaching the Potomac River, which is a short distance from my house.  It was about the size and intensity of a single aircraft landing light, and appeared to be flying at standard approach altitude for Dulles Airport, which is also not very far from where I live.   At first I thought it was an aircraft either leaving or approaching Dulles Airport.  I then noticed that the object had no navigation lights of any sort.  If it had been an aircraft, I would have been able to see the standard green and red lights at its apparent altitude.  I thought at first that it might have been a satellite, but ruled this out quickly, because it was too large, and traveling too rapidly.   When the object slowly changed direction, and began to fly due east, I definitely knew it was not a satellite.  After about five minutes, the object suddenly disappeared from view, which furt! her aroused my suspicion.   The only other possibility was a drone, but I do not believe it was one of these either, because of its flight path, its apparent altitude, and its sudden disappearance.;39.0162333333333;-77.422037356322

Two ruby red dots, appeared out of thin air and within seconds were miles apart moving abnormally clockwise and counter clock wise.;2021-07-01 00:08:00;60 seconds;Two ruby red dots, appeared out of thin air and within seconds were miles apart moving abnormally clockwise and counter clock wise. It was 12:08 am on July 1, 2021. I was on my way back home from driving my husband to his night job. I was singing in the car and focusing on the road checking my mirrors and looking around as no one was in front of me.  I was driving eastbound on route 7, a quarter of a mile before the exit to route 28 south bound facing east, when to my slight left above, looking north east I saw two washed out ruby red dots appear out of thin air, close together parallel. My eyes immediately focused on them because they were so bright and I was looking in the same direction moments before they appeared out of thin air. I can vouch that they just appeared out of thin air. They were in my line of sight. I thought it was a firework that was set off at first, the type that just appears up above and falls down, however the lights didn’t move. They appeared still for a couple seconds and started to move away from each other and started to pivot parallel in a clockwise motion. They distanced themselves about at least 20 ft at first, and then started shifting counter clockwise and quickly separated, moving away from each other. Within a second they we’re at least 10 miles away from each other. It was so sudden th! at I had to look back because I couldn’t keep both dots in my view when I observed them spread out. They slowly stopped turning and stayed still at maybe a 20 degree angle incline. I looked behind me and the other red dot was behind. They literally made a mirrored motion.  There were two other cars, one beside me and one behind me and we all slowed down and looked up. I’m not sure who else saw it but once they spread out they stayed still and didn’t move for the next minute. I continued my way home as I was only a minute away and noticed that the ufo that pivoted lower flickered and faded into the clouds. I don’t know what it is but my hairs stood up as soon as they appeared. I was completely alert singing on my way home and it felt like they showed in my eye sight for me to see. I was terrified and had to call my husband to calm me down. It was the most alarming thing I have ever seen.;39.0162333333333;-77.422037356322
