Two witnesses- a large star with four smaller stars revolving around it.;1998-08-15 22:00:00;8-10 minutes;Two witnesses- a large star with four smaller stars revolving around it. I was walking with a friend of mine from my house, down the street to his house.  It was quite a while ago.  He lives down the street from me.  The stars were particularly visible that night, so I was looking at them while I walked.  There was one star that caught my attention.  It was as bright, if not brighter than the north star, but it was overhead, slightly to the east.  I stopped my friend and asked him what star it was, and he didn't know.  We looked at it a while, and were about to walk on.  But then, four other smaller stars came out of the bright star, and seemed to revolve around it.  It was extremely high and far away, but was clear enough to make out.  The large star stayed stationary, as the other stars moved in and out and around erraticaly.  No idea what it could have been.  I am not a strong believer in UFO's.  Just stumbled on the web-site and thought I'd report it.;39.0162333333333;-77.422037356322
Fast moving object zig zagging over Washington DC;2007-12-14 00:00:00;3 minutes;Fast moving object zig zagging over Washington DC I had just stepped outside on my deck when I caught out of the corner of my eyes, what I thought a falling star and I watched it as it quickly stopped and then moved very fast in a zig zag pattern.   It would stop in between and align itself with other stars in the sky.  While doing so, it's brightness would fade and then it would move very quickly again.   The direction that I was facing was East, which is over Washington DC.   What fascinated me the most was how fast this thing was moving, but yet it would stop very quickly and position itself beside a star or a group of stars.;39.0162333333333;-77.422037356322
Large flashing lights in sky that seemed cohesive but stationary- red, blue, white flashes.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius??  PD));2013-11-10 00:00:00;hours;Large flashing lights in sky that seemed cohesive but stationary- red, blue, white flashes. In the night sky close to midnight I saw what I thought was a plane or helicopter but realized it did not move.  It was stationary and very bright, flashing red, blue and white lights.   I estimated it to be 2-3 miles away at medium altitude.  It appeared very large- bigger than an airliner.   I watched it flash for at least 30 minutes at work.   Upon returning home I noticed it was still in the sky and it demonstrated the same characteristics.  It absolutely did not move.  The flashing lights would increase and decrease in intensity.   I watched it from my apartment complex parking lot for another 30 minutes at least.  I saw it, bar workers from my neighboring workplace saw it and my child saw it.   At some points we saw it seem to emit beams- white in color.   It seemed to have a haze around it at points.  Will send poor quality video later.;39.0162333333333;-77.422037356322
