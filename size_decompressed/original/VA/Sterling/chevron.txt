Strange Orange Flying Litghts in Sterling, VA;2011-10-22 23:00:00;20 minutes;Strange Orange Flying Litghts in Sterling, VA Standing outside while my dog used the bathroom.   Something caught my attention.  First I only saw two orange lights in the sky flying in a straight pattern.  I ran into the house to tell my family members and upon my return we were able to view 10 more.  They flew in a straight pattern across the sky and didn't make any noise.  Sure would like to know what they were.;39.0162333333333;-77.422037356322
