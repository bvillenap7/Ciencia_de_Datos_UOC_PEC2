EXPLODING FLASH OF LIGHT NW SKY â€“ STERLING, VA;2008-06-24 21:15:00;Instant;EXPLODING FLASH OF LIGHT NW SKY.   STERLING, VA Not sure the qualifies but last night 6-24-08 around 9:10 p.m. while sitting in my back yard, I was observing the clear sky and bright stars.  I was facing towards the Potomac River looking slightly north-west at a group of three bright stars that formed an astrological triangle.  I am no expert but I think it was a group that includes Polaris.  As I was gazing at these stars just to the left a very bright light flashed head on then disappeared.  It did not shoot across the sky it came on then went out almost like someone turned on a flashlight in the sky then turned it off.   It was 10 times the size of the stars I was looking at. Only thing I can think of perhaps I was witnessing a meteor head on instead of sideways. Is this possible? or did something explode?;39.0162333333333;-77.422037356322
