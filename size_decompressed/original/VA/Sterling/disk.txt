Glowing UFO over Sterling, VA;1980-06-15 21:00:00;8 secs;Glowing UFO over Sterling, VA Early in the day on June 15, there was a tornado that touched down near Sterling, VA and it knocked all the power out for thousands of people.  There was no electricity for many hours, so my husband and I decided to cook our dinner on our outdoor barbeque and invite our neighbor over.  We sat on the back porch and it was around 9 p.m., when the three of us went into the backyard. From the corner of my eye, I saw something coming fast and looked up, as did my neighbor.  My husband was looking in the opposite direction.   A disk/saucer shape that glowed light orange-white was racing across the sky, slightly skipping/shifting from side to side.  Since there was no electricity, there was no light pollution and we got a good look.  It was about the size of a tablet of aspirin held at arms length.   We watched it long enough that I began to crouch down afraid.   It went across the sky in about 8 seconds and then tilted up into the night and disappeared -- I've never forgotten it and wonder if anyone else saw it. There was no sound -- it was completely quiet.;39.0162333333333;-77.422037356322
Close encounter in Sterling near the water tower.;1998-07-15 19:00:00;15 min;Close encounter in Sterling near the water tower. I cannot remember if it was summer of 98 or 99. A friend and I were walking up a street near the water tower in sterling and spotted a craft about 200-400 yards N/E. We watched as (at first) a grouping of strange lights moved towards us at a slow rate of speed. About 5 min after watching the lights we were able to make out a shape. Typical 1950's shape flying saucer. We just stood there watching this craft get closer and closer to us. Eventually we could make out what looked like actual back lit windows, nothing visible inside. It stopped about 25 yards away from us and just sat there for a couple minutes until I made the strange observation that it was not making sound. We then ran away. (Both of us think we have about 1.5 hrs missing time) I noticed 2 postings from same time frame in same area, with a familiar description. I was hoping to contact other witnesses. This sighting changed my life. Thanks, ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));39.0162333333333;-77.422037356322
