Rectangle shaped object with rounded edges appears white against blue sky hovers with no sound.;2007-02-08 12:30:00;3-5 minutes;Rectangle shaped object with rounded edges appears white against blue sky hovers with no sound. At 12:30 PM February 8, 2007 I was traveling north on Route 11 approaching Fort Defiance. The sky was crystal clear blue with sunshine and no clouds at all.   I saw a rectangular shaped object with rounded edges to the west of Rt.11 which appeared snow white against the blue sky.  As I kept glancing at it as I drove, I realized that it was not moving.  It was hovering above the former Augusta Military School and Augusta Stone Church at approximately the height of a small plane or helicopter.  It did not appear to have any visible means of propulsion.  There was another motorist pulled off on the right side of the road directly in front of the old school with their window down and appeared to be observing the object with binoculars.  The object gradually began to slowly move westward.   After turning left on the next road, I pulled off in front of the Fort Defiance High School to watch the object.  With no sound or any means of propulsion, it shot away to the west at a very high speed and was completely out of sight in less than 15 seconds.  I am a college graduate who works at our local hospital and have lived in the area since 1975 after graduating from James Madison University. I have very good eyesight and know that I observed (as well as another motorist) something very unusual in the sky that day which can not be explained. I hesitated to report the sighting, but decided to go ahead after realizing that I witnessed something miraculous that day.;38.2126;-78.929
