Using 10 dobsonian telescope aimed at the moon I saw a black figure zoom across.  Magnifaction was 40 power, using two filters and a 26mm lenses (focal length is 1442mm for the scope).  Object was approximalty covered 5 to 10 percent the image of the moon relative to the moon's size in the telescope lens.  It was a full moon.  When looking into the sky without the telescope immediatly after seeing the object there were no contrails, sounds, lights of any type resembling an airplane.  The object was black, shaped like a top-hat, and what looked to be a curved doom.  Sighting was only a few seconds.  Not sure what it was.  Submitting incase someone else was looking at the moon at the same time, and saw something.;38.2126;-78.929
