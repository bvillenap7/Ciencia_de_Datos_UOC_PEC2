I was at a stop light and saw a blue laser light  reflecting on the the clouds at a high altitude. It was making at first a small circle, then would relocate itself to another place in the sky. I watched it thinking someone was using a beam as an advisement for a business but there was no beam to lead down to the originating point.  So I thought someone was using a huge laser pin to shine in the night sky, but then it is a flight path which would be illegal. It then  literally swung out of nowhere close above the ground to my left about 100 yards away and appeared to be a small aircraft but had great control like a helicopter, and hovered on an tilting angle without any sound  almost shaped like a dragonfly. It had elongated wings, and a center. It did tilt while it was moving in a controlled manner going back and forth in a small circle. No airplane would have that ability. It had blue neon lights /glo! w surrounding the entire edges of the wings. It happened all so fast I think there may have been a bit of pink tinge alongside the blue.  The body appear to be  grey.  It definitely glowed. It really was lovely.  Then it disappeared.;38.8375033557047;-77.4623241610738
