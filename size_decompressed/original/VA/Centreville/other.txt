Aliens check out local high school football game.;2003-10-10 19:15:00;10 minutes;Aliens check out local high school football game. My husband, 15-yr old stepson and I were traveling east on Union Mill Road going to a local high school football game when I spotted the object.    Traffic was backed up and parking was a nightmare so we were driving very slow.      My stepson and I saw the object hovering above a housing development located at Union Mill Road and Sequoia Lea Road - across the street from Centreville High School.  (my husband did not see it   he was concentrating on the road)   The object was hovering very low, around 500 feet and was motionless and silent for the majority of the viewing.    The object was arranged in a 3-spoke type configuration much like a Mercedes Benz symbol and the spokes appeared to be in equal distance from one another.   Each of the three spokes was completely lined with white lights and in the middle of the spokes was a red light.   The lights were constantly on while the object was still.    The object was very large.    It appeared to be much larger than the homes it was hovering over.     We drove past the object, but in our hunt for a parking spot passed back by the sighting spot twice.   After driving past the object was obscured by trees.    After turning around and heading back towards the site the first time, my stepson and I both saw the object rising up and the white lights were cycling off and on in a pattern around the object (like the lights were chasing one another) and the red light was also blinking.     After turning around and heading back towards the site, the object was not visible. ((NUFORC Note:  We have inquired of the witness whether the lights might have been from an advertising display, but we have not heard back from the party.  PD)) ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS)) No, my incident was not an advertising campaign.    One, there are no businesses anywhere within about 3/4 mile from where the sighting occured.   The sighting was over a rather large subdivision, and I have yet to see someone put sky beams in their yard!   There was definitely something above those houses.   I thought you would be interested, but I see that you are not.    That's fine. ((END));38.8375033557047;-77.4623241610738
Object with lighted sphere in center and red/blue/green triangles on either side.;2012-11-09 22:00:00;Uncertain;Object with lighted sphere in center and red/blue/green triangles on either side I was approaching Braddock Road from Sequoia Farms, about to make a right and something over my head caught my eye . Living so close to IAD I'm used to constant air traffic over my head but this was very different. The center of the object was a spherical shape that lit up for a few seconds then went dark, lit up again slowly then would go dark, in a seemingly random order.  There were two triangular shaped pieces on either side, kind of flanking the center sphere.  The triangles on either side had red/blue/green lights that kind of chased and went around quickly.  It seemed very close, almost just above the trees. I watched for a few minutes but soon cars were behind me and I had to move, so I don't know how long it was there.;38.8375033557047;-77.4623241610738
An arrowhead object was seen in Centreville, Virginia.;2013-04-13 22:31:00;4 seconds;an arrowhead object was seen in Centreville, Virginia. That evening we were outside with my wife, we were planning our summer vocation and enjoying first worm nights of this year, suddenly she told me &quot- look up, do you see that?&quot and this is what we saw...  Actual shape was not really visible. The object had red lights, which gave an idea of the shape.  If to look at the sequence of those red lights, you can assume that it is an arrowhead shape.  The red lights were not bright, you could see them just if to pay attention. It flew about 200 feet of the ground. It did not make any noise.  The approximate size was about one or two school buses. We saw that object just for a few seconds,than it disappeared behind townhouses roofs. We live around 20-23 miles from Dulles International Airport, I know how the passenger and military aircrafts look like, it was not one of them.;38.8375033557047;-77.4623241610738
