V-shaped UFO flew by directly overhead fast and silently.;2016-02-28 21:30:00;10 seconds;V-shaped UFO flew by directly overhead fast and silently. Fast moving V-shaped craft outlined by a row of 4 yellowish lights on one side and five on the other flying low due north.  Clear moonless and stary night, no clouds.   Three of us sitting in our hot tub looking up saw it as it moved fast and silent overhead.   We're used to seeing aircraft approaching and taking off from nearby Dulles International Airport.  This was nothing like what we've seen before.;38.8375033557047;-77.4623241610738
Sighting of a semi-triangular formation of lights in the Northern VA sky.;2018-03-10 21:00:00;<1 minute;Sighting of a semi-triangular formation of lights in the Northern VA sky. On the night of 3/10/2018, my husband and I were on our back porch and regarding the stars.  We were both looking up and commenting on how bright they were and looking for constellations we are familiar with.   Suddenly, we both zeroed in on what appeared to be a triangle of lights with the bottom missing moving across the sky.  There may have been about 7 or so lights per side, I did not count.  The lights looked about the same color and size as medium-large stars.  It moved north west at a relatively low altitude/speed and disappeared behind the trees.   I could not make out any specific body of a craft, we could just see the lights.  I have seen a lot of airplanes, I know what those look like.  I could see those this evening as well!   This 2/3 triangle could not be explained, and I have never in my life seen anything like it.  It was not normal.   Whatever it was, it was pretty remarkable to see and I am happy to have seen it.

((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and found her to be exceptionally eloquent, and unusually objective in her description of the sighting event.  We suspect that she is an excellent, and highly reliable, witness.  PD));38.8375033557047;-77.4623241610738
