Bright light over Goochland VA;2010-07-05 22:00:00;7 seconds;Bright light over Goochland VA I saw a bright light directly above,   About as bright as a plane looks when it is heading towards you with the full headlights on.  This was directly above and very bright white light and was very high, it was too slow to be a shooting star.  I saw it for several seconds then it disappeared.  I looked for a shape going over the strs but there was nothing. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of information elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
