Henrico;2011-03-13 01:00:00;90 minutes;Henrico I went for a late night walk in the east end area when me & 3 of my friends saw 10 rainbow colored objects in the clear sky, 5 were on the rite & 5 on the left.  They changed shape & moved from side to side & zigzag motion.  It was cool it was like they wanted to be seen.  I had never seen a ufo before but I have no choice but to believe now;37.489508405797;-77.4145866666669
