I looked up into the sky an a warm summer night and I witnessed a soundless, glowing, and circular blue light streak across the sky at incredible speed before passing over some trees.  It did not leave a trail or streak of light.  It was nothing like an airplane this was one gigantic, glowing light that emitted no sound. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

Orangish yellow orbs.;2017-08-17 21:10:00;2 minutes;My husband, daughter, and I were sitting outside, and all of a sudden, we saw 2 orangish yellow orbs, following each other above the trees near the James River, heading towards downtown.   I was unable to capture with my Nikon, but we have never seen anything like that before.;37.489508405797;-77.4145866666669
