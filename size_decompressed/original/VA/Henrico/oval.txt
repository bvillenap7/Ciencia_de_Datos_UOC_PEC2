Neon blue oval shape zipping across the sky;2011-12-24 18:20:00;10 seconds;neon blue oval shape zipping across the sky I was walking across the street and looked up to see a neon blue oval shape flying across the sky. It had multiple shades of blue and the area around it was slightly hazy.  It left a small trail but nothing as long as a fighter jet. I believe headed southeast. It zipped across the sky like a falling star, but was noticeably larger and at a rather low altitude. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
