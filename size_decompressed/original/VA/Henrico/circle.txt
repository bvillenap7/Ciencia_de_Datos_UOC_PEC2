A yellowish round object caught in photos of jet trails.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a sens flare, we believe.  PD);2014-04-18 07:45:00;seconds;A yellowish round object caught in photos of jet trails. I was going for a shot of all the jet trails, particularly the three intersecting at the same spot. But when I looked at the images, I spotted a circular object I had not noticed when just looking at the sky. It's in one place in the first image and in a much different place, to the right, in the second which was snapped just a fraction of a moment later. I've enlarged it and included the edges of the nearby jet trails for perspective. It was taken near the interchange of interstates 295 and 95, heading north on 95.  The window was down so it's not dirty glass or a reflection of the Sun.  It's not another jet since there's no jet trail behind it.  And I don't see how a morning star or planet would seem to move such a distance in pictures taken one after the other from virtually the same location.
