Craft changes shapes, disappears and reappears, and changes direction under the clouds while making no noise.;2000-11-20 12:15:00;3 minutes;Craft changes shapes, disappears and reappears, and changes direction under the clouds while making no noise. At first the object had three white lights in the shape of a backwards 7.  The lights being on the points of the seven.  It had a red flashing light in the middle. It was moving to the right. Then it disappeared.  It then reappeared in the same shape, but was moving straight upwards.  It then disappeared again.  It reappeared one more time, but in a different shape.  It had six white lights in a hexagon shape(like a stop sign with 6 lights instead of 8).  It also had a red flashing light in the middle.  It was closer this time and was moving in the opposite direction that it was when I first saw it.  I could tell that it was below the clouds and it was making no noise at all.  The only thing i could see was the lights, no outline of a craft or anything.  It was moving away from us and I eventually lost it on the way back to my fiends house.  When we pulled in the driveway we saw an airplane moving very quickly in the direction that the UFO was headed.  We also saw two helicopters as well.;37.9757;-78.932
