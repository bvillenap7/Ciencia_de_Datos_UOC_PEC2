Blue/green flashing light power outage northern VA;2006-02-11 02:00:00;2-3 minutes;Blue/green flashing light power outage northern VA I was up late on saturday night taking a shower while the rest of my family was asleep.  It was snowing heavily outside and the lights began to flicker.  At first I thought 'Lovely. I still have tons of shampoo in my hair, and the lights are about to go out.' Then I started to feel this terrible sense of panic.  I looked at the light bulbs and they were slowly dimming and brightening, dimming and brightening.  As I grabbed a towel they went completely out, and I went to my brother's room close by for some moonlight by which to grab a flashlight.  As I walked up a brilliant blue light flashed above the house, covering everything I could see in blue.  After the flash I ran to grab my mom, who was instantly terrified by my mood.  I was deeply frightened. I could feel a presence near me, and although I am normally sensitive to people's emotions (i.e. knowing something is wrong without any hints or expressions) this was magnified many times over, and I could not stop praying. After I went to sleep a while later (according to my poor shaken and sleep-deprived mother) the lights came right back on. The next day I took my little sister and her friend to the movies.  Her friend mentioned the power outage and a strange green flashing light.  We compared experiences and they were rather similar.  She lives in the same neighborhood as I do.;38.7842;-77.3792
