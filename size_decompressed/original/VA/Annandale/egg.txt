Falling bright white object seen over Annandale, VA. area night of 11\9\02. WHO ELSE SAW IT!!??;2002-11-09 00:45:00;4 to 5 seconds;Falling bright white object seen over Annandale, VA. area night of 11\9\02. WHO ELSE SAW IT!!?? Between 12:30am and 12:45am, not sure of exact time, I saw what looked like a shooting star in the area of Annandale, VA. The strange thing was that it wasn't shooting, it was falling vertically down towards the ground. I saw it for no more than 4 to 5 seconds. It was bright white as a star, but became visible at a certain piont in the sky and faded out at a certain point. It was no longer visible a few hundred feet from the ground. The white light went out. I ask that anyone who was in the Annandale area of Virginia, and think they saw something similar late Sat. night, 11\9\02, to file a report on this website. ((NUFORC Note:  There may be some confusion with the date.  The witness seems to indicate that the event occurred after midnight on Saturday night, which would mean it occurred on Sunday morning, November 10th.  PD));38.8263;-77.2111000000001
