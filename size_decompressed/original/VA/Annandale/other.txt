Low flying kite shaped object with very faint lights evenly spaced from the tip and along the tail.;2006-11-17 23:45:00;40 seconds;Low flying kite shaped object with very faint lights evenly spaced from the tip and along the tail. strangest thing I've ever seen in the night sky.   I'm an amateur astronomer and was out looking for Leonid meteors, when I caught a very faint object approaching from the NW and moving to the SE.   At first I thought it was a very thin and long cloud, but as it came overhead I noticed a more chevron shaped head with a long tail...much like a traditional kite.  The really odd thing was there were very faint pinpoint lights (the magnitude of average stars seen from a suburban location) evenly spaced along the entire length.   As it moved from directly overhead I thought it might be a very low flying cargo plane or something, but it made no sound at all and there were no flashing/colored navigation lights.   Like I said, the strangest thing I've ever seen in 30 years of star gazing.;38.8263;-77.2111000000001
