two bright blinking lights;2001-12-20 22:20:00;2-3 minutes;two bright blinking lights As I was driving home  at about 10:20 pm I noticed two bright blinking lights in the  south west section of the sky. The lights were too far away from each other to be on one airplane but they seemed connected to each other. The lights seemed to move sort of erratically around and it seemed that the distance between them would vary. This lasted for about two minutes then they got too far away to see. I recall the lights being red, white and maybe green and there was no noise. It all happend too quickly to remember exactly what it looked like but it was vary strange.;38.8263;-77.2111000000001

Instead, I saw two bright lights, one above and larger than the other.  The lights appeared to be stationary.  I watched for about 15 minutes, then left to make coffee.   I returned to the window and the lights had moved upward.  I returned to my computer to make a report, which I have never done before.  I returned to the window and the lights had again moved upward.  They are still present, but as the sky lightens, they are harder to see. The lights are South of my house, unobserved from the North.  The lights move together as if part of an object.  I did not see a physical object, just lights.;38.8263;-77.2111000000001
