I was driving west on Route 236 Little River Turnpike heading towards the City of Fairfax. It was about 15 to 20 minutes past sunset.    As I was approaching the intersection of Route 236 & Pickett Rd, I noticed at my 10 o'clock position, about a quarter of a mile away, a black silhouette outline of a cigar/disk-like object with rounded or blunted ends, flying slowly about 300 to 500 feet above the tree line.    The object was approx. 120 to 160 feet in length (5 to 6 single-family houses in length) and about 30 to 50 feet height at the thickest point at it's center, traveling in a Northeast to Southwest direction.  What seemed unusual was it's slow speed (about 120 to 150 mph) and it's relatively low altitude above the tree line.   Also, there where 4 or 6 white strobe lights on the outer edges of the black silhouette cigar/disk-like object w/rounded / blunted ends and the strobe lights were evenly spaced at both ends and at the top and bottom edges near the ! center of the object, all blinking in unison and sometimes blinking in a counter-clockwise rotating pattern.    There were regular jet aircraft easily identifiable flying high above in the vicinity.;38.8263;-77.2111000000001
