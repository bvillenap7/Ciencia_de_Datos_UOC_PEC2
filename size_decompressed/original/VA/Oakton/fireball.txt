It then disappeared from our view as it went down the horizon. My husband and I were driving down West Ox Road with our convertible top down.  We had clear vision of the sky.  Suddenly an object came out of the sky. At first I thought it was a plane that was going to crash.  The color of it though had a green glow with just a little white at the end of it.  It didn't look like a ball shape and it had no tail like a comet.  The size from the distance we were at looked about the size of a commercial jet or larger (which is why at first I thought it was a plane.  It fell towards the horizon and then disappeared from our view. I almost expected an explosion from something that size, but there was no sound.  I listened to the news but didn't hear about a meteor or comet sighting. Do you think that this is what it was? My husband is a college grad and works as a product manager. I work for a temp agency.;38.8829909090909;-77.3459409090909
