Hovering octagonal (diamond) shape object with flashing lights in the night sky.;2014-01-29 20:10:00;5-10 seconds;Hovering octagonal (diamond) shape object with flashing lights in the night sky. January 30, 2014 Last night, January 29, shortly after 8pm when my husband and I were driving into our driveway and as we neared the entrance to our garage, I saw in the night sky above us what I initially thought might be a helicopter, but it was not the shape of a helicopter, but more of an octagonal shape with flashing lights (I’m going to say red, white, and blue) on each corner.  It was hovering above us.  I could also detect the lights of an airplane high above it on its way to Dulles Airport. We live a 15-20 minute drive from Dulles Airport and are in the flight pattern for planes flying into Dulles.  I quickly rolled down my window to see if I could hear a helicopter sound, but no, no buzzing of a helicopter, which is also not unusual to see and hear in our neighborhood, and it was as this point that it sped out of my view.  This all happened in a matter of seconds.  I don’t know how long it had been hovering there before we saw it.;38.8829909090909;-77.3459409090909
