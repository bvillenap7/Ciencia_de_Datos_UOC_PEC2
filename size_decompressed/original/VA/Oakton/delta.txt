Then the two lights changed direction. Then I saw what appeared to be the bottom of a large moving object.  It was covered with rows of lights, mostly white lights and a few red lights. The two bright white lights appeared at night outside my house.  Then they turned across the backyard. It was very quiet.  Then when I went outside and looked up into the sky I saw rows of much smaller white lights mixed with a few red lights near the middle.  These lights were all moving slowly together as though they were on the bottom of a very large moving object. The shape was elongated but it appeared to have wings on each side in the middle. The lights covered this base and wing surface area. I felt that I was looking up underneath the object.  It slowly and quietly moved in a straight line right above the trees across my backyard and my neighbors backyard.  It moved at the same speed until it disappeared.  I listenend for a helipcopter or plane noise but only noticed a low level hum as it disappeared in the distance. Then I heard a swhoosh noise.  The object was massive and it seemed as though it was deliberately scanning the area. Later I saw the two lights again bu!t this time they darted away.;38.8829909090909;-77.3459409090909
