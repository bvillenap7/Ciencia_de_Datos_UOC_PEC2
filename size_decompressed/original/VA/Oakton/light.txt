small glowing object moving slowly among the trees;2001-02-08 06:30:00;1 minute;small glowing object moving slowly among the trees At approximately 06:30, on the morning of 08 Feb 2001, I had an early meeting at work so I left about an hour earlier than I usually do.  It was still dark, and there was a very bright full moon.  As I was about a tenth of a mile from my apartment building on Bushman Street, Oakton, Virginia I looked at the moon which was bright and low on the horizon.  To the left and below of the moon I saw an amber colored light moving slowly from right to left, approximately over the A T & T regional headquarters building compound.  At first I thought that it was an airplane taking off from Dulles Airport which is about twenty miles away in that direction but I realized that it was far too low on the horizon for it to be an airplane and it seemed to me that it was almost at tree top level.  I realized that it was quite near. I made a right turn on to Borge street and noticed that the object had turned towards my vehicle.  It blinked or pulsated once, and then held a steady amber color. It seemed to stop and hover over the edge of a small childrens playground.  At that time I had turned left onto Jermantown road and had to concentrate on my driving,though I was still looking towards my left where it was hovering about 200 feet away, at the height of a street lamp or so. I had to get gasoline and after that, about ten minutes later I again passed the spot where I had seen this object, and it was no longer there.  At first I thought that maybe I had seen a street lamp or something as it was earlier for me than usual but the object was no longer there on my second pass by the area, so that was not it. Nor could it have been the full moon as I had seen both at the same time. The object seemed to be a small glowing sphere or so, maybe the size of a basket ball though this is very difficult to ascertain.;38.8829909090909;-77.3459409090909
