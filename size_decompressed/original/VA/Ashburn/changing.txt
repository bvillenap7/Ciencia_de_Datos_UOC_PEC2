As I did I saw a bright reflective silvery cylindrical object (more of a line than two-dimensional) in the sky swiftly moving from West to East overhead in the clear sky.  About the width of my index fingernail at arms length.   It immediately morphed into a violent rapidly changing highly reflective shape as if it were a flat mirror randomly twisting about on three a axis gimbal.  Not a bird, not a party balloon.  The motion was violent.  No rhythmic pattern.  I expected it to move over the Giant Food store parking lot where I could see its silhouette, but instead it faded into the high altitude water vapor in the sky.   It was much higher in altitude than I estimated, and much larger.  My first thought it was about 60 feet up, but after seeing it fade away so rapidly, I estimate it to be at least a few hundred feet long, at least 30,000 feet up.  It appeared to be traveling at several thousand miles per hour.  No noise.  No vapor trail. No wings.   I'm 54, seen a lot in the sky I have been able to explain.  Not this.;39.036888040601;-77.5061413724565
