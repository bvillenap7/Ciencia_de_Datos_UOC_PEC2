Object moving unilaterally;2009-10-06 14:30:00;5 minutes;Object moving unilaterally I came out on my deck because of a sound of a low flying helicopter.  When I came outside, I did not see the helicopter but saw a plane way up where planes usually fly at, around 30,000 feet.  I really felt a kind of experience next as I looked to the west north/west in the sky and saw another object. At this moment I saw the plane and the object at the same time and could tell that the plane, moving at a fixed speed, was different than the other object. As I looked at the object longer it started to dominate my vision as the sky around the object began to turn pink and change color. It was moving towards me but in a fashion of looping circles and it was moving clearly faster than the plane as well as different directions. It than took a different direction totally and went behind a cloud. I never have seen an object like this before and I couldn't stop looking at it. I knew it wasn't a plane because of the plane of reference that it was near. The cloud was qu! ite big and I never saw the object again. But I have been a skeptic of UFO's for a long time always saying that if I saw it I would be the judge. This has made me more of a believer. I am not sure if I can explain this in more detail but I had to let someone know about it.;39.036888040601;-77.5061413724565
We saw over 12 objects in the clear night sky.;2015-10-15 20:30:00;15 minutes;We saw over 12 objects in the clear night sky. As I was driving home with my two children, ages 14 and 8, something in the sky caught my attention.  The sky was clear and I saw many lights.  There were more than 12 objects (so many I stopped counting at 12) bunched together in the sky.  They were disk-like objects with red, green, and white lights.  The lights were mostly white.  They came down quickly.  It was almost like a sudden drop then they darted off in different directions.   As I continued driving home, I still saw them however, they were more spaced out. We were about 8 miles from an airport at the time of the sighting. I am sure that these were not planes however, it is possible that planes were in the area at that time.  I would assume that the airport would have noticed something.  I am currently a preschool teacher and a teacher in the Children's Ministry at my church.;39.036888040601;-77.5061413724565
