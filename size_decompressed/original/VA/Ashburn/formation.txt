Driving up suburban road in a northwest direction, this would be in the direction to western Maryland, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania..  Driving up i noticed what I first thought to be a firework that had just exploded from the look of spread out blue orbs.  Getting a better look i noticed that these where stationary blue orbs, these orbs where a type of blue that is akin to the color of dark tropical water, with a majority of them clustered in a vertical line and to the immediate right around five of these orbs where spread out but still within the height of the first vertical cluster.  These orbs stayed in a stationary location, I went inside my house and check up on them about ten minuets after first seeing them, and they where no longer visible.  i did not see them disperse.  Living near a large international airport i see many planes and many types of them and this was absolutely not a plane or any other conventional type aircraft that i have ever seen based on the formation of the lights and the lack of movement within the formation itself.  while driving home i did have unusual radio problems.;39.036888040601;-77.5061413724565
