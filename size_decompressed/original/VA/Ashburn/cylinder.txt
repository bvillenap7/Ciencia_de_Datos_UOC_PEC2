She stares for 30 seconds saying what the... before I get curious. She then tells me a craft us hovering in our soccer field 100 yards further than the back yard. We start taking pictures of the 3 lights showing the shape. A blinker like a air craft blinking red is in the center (which throws me off). Then as I switch phone to different setting for better picture, we witness the craft hover straight down onto the street that hangs above the soccer field goal. I freak out and don't want to stop staring ad it seems to sit there like a car, until other cars finally pass and confirm it is there. See run out back on our deck to take more pictures but it appeared to morphe into a car. Or it simply evaporated or disappeared on landing and was never there after touching down. This is the 3rd or 4th time (second with pics and video) so I wanted to write about it a! fter seeing the number of sightings in my area this year.;39.036888040601;-77.5061413724565
