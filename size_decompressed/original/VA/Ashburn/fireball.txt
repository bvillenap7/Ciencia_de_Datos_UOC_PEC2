Bright red lights over Ashburn, Virginia;2012-08-18 20:40:00;10 minutes;Bright red lights over Ashburn, Virginia At 8:40p, I took our dog out the garage and proceeded to the front of our home and upon walking down to the grass noticed two disctinct glowing red/orangish objects moving towards us over the tree line.  The were moving faster than an airplane, but not nearly as fast as a shooting star. All of a sudden the one on the left made an immediate 90 degree turn and within the blink of an eye went due west and was out of site - the object on the right remained stationary. I then went and rang our home doorbell repeatedly and told my wife to look and she was in disbelieve - it was literally right above the tree line.  Then all of a sudden another pair of these objects appeared in the distance and started to get closer to the first object that remained - then all of a sudden the first object disappeared instantenously.  When the next two objects got to the approximate position of the first they remained constant and then over about 5-10 seconds disappeared. As this was g! oing on, I quickly went over and got our neighbors and told them to look and more importantly confirm what we saw so it could be noticed by someone outside our home.  After it was all said and done, there were ~14 of these objects that came to the same position, always in groups of two, and then vanished into mid-air. There was absolutely zero noise with these objects and they were extremely bright with a reddish/orangish coloring.  Given we live extremely close to Dulles International Airport and have planes from all over the world both military and commercial flying over and around our development, I/we can attest these objects were definitely nothing that were man made given the shear speed, no sound, and brightness. In fact, a plane flew over about 10 minutes after these objects disappeared and you could easily make out the strobes and the sound at 30K+ feet.  This event has definitely made us pause and wonder what will happen next... ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Some appeared out of nowhere, 1 hovered for several minutes and 2 change direction and then get back into formation.;2012-12-31 23:50:00;10 minutes;Some appeared out of nowhere, 1 hovered for several minutes and 2 change direction and then get back into formation. A few minutes before midnight New Years eve 2013 i went outside to smoke a cigarette.  I noticed an very unusual light above the flight path of landing planes at Dulles International Airport.   As i grab my camera and start to record, 33sec's in another light appears out of nowhere. After about 2 minutes, 6 more craft came from beyond the building across the street and flew over top of my home.  2 of them changed course and 1 of the 2 stopped and hovered for several minutes before getting back in formation and flying off.  They flew over my building to where i could no longer record.  They did not appear to ascend but to continue W SW toward Washington DC.  I have 7-8 minutes of video.  The video is rather large i will email if i can.;39.036888040601;-77.5061413724565
