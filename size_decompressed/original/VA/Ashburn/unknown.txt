Lights and strange sounds awaken couple. Details defy an ordinary explanation.;2004-11-07 03:50:00;15 seconds;Lights and strange sounds awaken couple. Details defy an ordinary explanation. At 3:50am, my girlfriend and I were awakened by a noise and light coming from above the house. The noise sounded like the hum from a balast on a flourescent light. The light was blueish.  We don't have any flourescent lights and the hum or reverb from the sound could be felt throughout the room.  The noise and light repeated 5 seconds later 5 seconds later it repeated again.  I jumped up to look out the window, and even out the front door, but saw nothing.  I don't know what it was, but I am hoping that a log of the event will help to find the answer.;39.036888040601;-77.5061413724565
