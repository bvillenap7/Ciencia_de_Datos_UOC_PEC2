My mom and brother had just gone to bed, and i was awake in my room. I was just about to go to sleep when i herd a low sound comming from outside. I ran to my mom's room and looked out the window. I was a huge objusct that lokked almost like a fighter juet but i was glowing a green eary color. It vanished out of site high in to the sky, I could still see the flares from the back thought. The secound time occured 10 minutes after at 12:25am. Another object came from the right side of my house....but it was not glowing green. It made a loud, low rumbling sound that you couldnt make up in movies, it passed right infrom of my window. After it was out of site the sound could still be herd for about 3-4 minutes. 1 car's alarm did go off at the time of the secound object passing by. Just because I am young dosnt mean I would pull a trick.....please believe that I am telling the truth.  -UFO believer ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.
