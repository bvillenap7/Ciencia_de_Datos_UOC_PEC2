I then noticed a flashing red light.  At first it looked like it could have been a plane, but the way it was hovering proved that it was no such thing.;39.036888040601;-77.5061413724565
6-8 lights moving in circular pattern from west to south along the sky;2021-05-08 21:36:00;1 minute;6-8 lights moving in circular pattern from west to south along the sky Saw 6-8 lights the were equal in brightness to the stars. The lights were steady and did not blink like the normal air traffic in the area.  They were observed south west of Ashburn VA. They were equidistant from each other and appeared to move in a circular pattern from west to the south.  As they continued south they were no longer visible. They moved at a moderate speed similar to that of an airplane keeping equal space from each other the whole time;39.036888040601;-77.5061413724565
