I just saw my 3rd UFO over Ashburn, this 3rd one this afternoon!  Looked out the window at a jet chemtrail w/ jet heading south at 4:35 PM this Sat 4 Jan 2014.  Saw bright specular point of light following chemtrail. Got my binoculars and focused in. Thought it was jet not emitting trail.  Common to see pairs up there, one emitting trail, the other not. Bright shiny metallic sphere, followed parallel along chemtrail and then stopped, Hovered, floated under chemtrail then reversed direction. Shrunk in size.  Grew in size and reflected sunlight again as before.  Then dimmed, turned gray, then QUICKLY SHRUNK TO DOT AND DISAPPEARED IN ABOUT 2 SECONDS!  Time in sighting was about 2 minutes. The chemtrail section it hovered next to dissolved away! This just now happened. Attached is photo I took of chemtrail after the event took place. Notice break in trail.  The UFO hovered in the middle of that section while the chemtrail was fully formed.  After the UFO disappeared the section faded away also!  Notice tree branch on left indicates the break in the chemtrail:;39.036888040601;-77.5061413724565
