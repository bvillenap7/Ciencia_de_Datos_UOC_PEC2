I kept watching for several minutes and it started to wiggle and flicker some more.  Soon the star started zipping back and forth, and up and down very quicky.   I started looking at other stars in the sky and some of those were doing it too, but not as fast and all over the place as the main one.   I called my best friend to have him go look.  He lives in another part of the state and he saw them too.;37.9062;-77.6341
