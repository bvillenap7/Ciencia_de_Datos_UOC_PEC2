Rectangular object in the sky caught in a photograph taken at a car show.;2014-04-27 13:45:00;unknown;Rectangular object in the sky caught in a photograph taken at a car show. I was at a car show in Vinton, Virginia, on 24 April, 2014, at the Vinton War Memorial.   When I returned home, I was editing the photographs that I had taken at the event.  In the top right-hand corner one of the photographs, I saw a small rectangular object.   I did not see this when I took the picture, as I was focused on the car I was photographing.  It did not look like a bug, or anything stuck to the lens.   It only showed up in the one photograph.  I enlarged the image in the area of the object to get a closer look.   The object was rectangular with what looks like a protrusion from one side.  The object was west or northwest of my position.   I will send digital images to you.
