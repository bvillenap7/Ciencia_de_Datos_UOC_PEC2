My son and I were driving home last Friday night (12/4/09) about 5:45 pm when we saw a triangular object hovering in the sky.  We pulled the car over and looked above our heads and saw the following:  A large circular red light in the center of the bottom of the black, triangular shaped object.   There were three other red lights on the bottom tips of each angle of the triangle.  There were also three pulsating yellow lights that were going clockwise at a medium pace. The UFO appeared to hover quietly then move straight up and down without sound.  We heard a low rumbling sound emit from the object while it moved very quickly in a diagonal manner, then shifted direction suddenly in different directions.  The UFO then began hovering silently again. About 30 minutes later we heard and saw a low flying fighter jet flying just above the tree line, going towards the UFO sighting area.;37.778;-75.641
