White orbs maneuvering strangely while flying drone (daytime).;2015-05-22 11:00:00;1 minute;White orbs maneuvering strangely while flying drone (daytime). I was outside my residence and started to fly my new phantom 3 I just got in the mail the day prior. I lifted the drone about 20 feet in the air to feel how it maneuvers.  As I looked up in i saw an orb (white and cloudy almost fuzzy) move across the sky pretty quickly.  Very high up, I would guess over 1000 feet. To my surprise, the orb stopped instantly and another two came near it.  It was not a plane as it defied physics as it moved around (Sharp turns and extreme acceleration)  I quickly put my remote down and let the drone hover while I ran inside to get my phone to snap a picture.  Spheres were gone when I returned.  I was wearing polarized sunglasses which might have aided detection against the cloudless bright sunny sky. I shall look up more now since it seems to me ufo's are out during the day as well.;38.3863;-78.9902
