On the way to get some food late with my friend and his girlfriend we are on the way back, while driving me and the driver notice some odd looking heat lightning(that's what it appeared to be) it flashed probably twice and out if no where a good size green dot appears and falls for a few seconds before disappearing, which it got dark again no lightning no green looking ufo, just want to say it bought tears to my eyes cause I've never seen anything of the sort before in my lifetime, definitely a new experience.;38.6524;-78.4578
