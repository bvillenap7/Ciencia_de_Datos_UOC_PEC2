strange flashing blue green and red lights suspended in the night sky;2005-09-20 23:00:00;past few nights;strange flashing blue green and red lights suspended in the night sky We were outside a few nights ago with the telescope, and noticed a strange light in the sky. It flashed some different colors, like red, blue and green so I dismissed it as an airplane. We then pointed the telescope at the moon for a little while. When I turned back around the light was STILL in the exact place it was before. It just hung there like a star, but unlike any star I ever saw. So of course we pointed the telescope at it. When I zoomed in and got a look at it, it was sooo weird. It reminded me of a rocket ship, the way the flames shoot out of the back, except they were flashing lots of colors. There was definetly some sort of solid object in the middle. So thats all it did, stay in one place and flash red, blue and green. After taking my eye from the telescope, I noticed another one,in the same area of the sky. It was a little further away or something because it wasn't as bright, but it had the same flashy colors. So, after looking at it a little longer, we went inside. The next few nights we watched for it. Each night for the past 3 or 4 we have seen them in different areas of the sky. There is one out there right now. I just looked out and saw it. It's starting to get a little strange. I would like to know if it's something that can be easily explained. That would make me feel better.;38.6524;-78.4578
