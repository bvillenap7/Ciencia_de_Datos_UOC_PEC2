Extremely Long Needle (over 2,000 ft) UFO observed 1 May traveling over 1500 MPH at over 70,000 ft;2005-05-01 15:21:00;3 minutes;Extremely Long Needle (over 2,000 ft) UFO observed 1 May traveling over 1500 MPH at over 70,000 ft On the afternoon of Sunday, the first of May, about or around 15:21 PM (EST), my son ((name deleted)) and I were loading groceries in the parking lot of the Wal-Mart in Luray Va. At the time I heard what sounded like a jet flying overhead, it sounded sort of unusual in that it did not sound like a normal jet as it had a very deep resonance. I asked ((name deleted)) if he could see the plane as I did not readily observe it, as there were scatterd clouds in the sky. These clouds were not rain clouds as they were cirrus clouds.  The craft then suddenly appeared out from behind the high cloud cover and I realized that there was absolutley no contrail being emitted from the craft.  The sound immediately indicated to me that the craft was extremely solid and well built as I looked and realized that this craft had to be in excess of well over 1500 or 2000 feet in length.  It was well above the cirrus clouds which I estimate to have been at 40 to 50 thousand feet.   This had a very long needle like appearance and was at about what I estimate to be 60 or 70 thousand feet.  It was very light bright white in color, no lights, and no apparent wings or tail.   In refernce to the direction of Route 340 which generally travels North to South, the craft was traveling due East.  My estimation of the speed at which the craft was traveling, can be arrived at by how long the time transpired from when I first heard the craft to the time when I located it and then perceiving its rate of speed as it traveled East towards Washington, D.C.  I can faithfully say that the craft was traveling in excess of 1500 miles per hour.;38.6524;-78.4578
