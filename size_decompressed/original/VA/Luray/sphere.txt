Glowing spheres over Luray, Va;2005-07-15 04:30:00;1 hour;Glowing spheres over Luray, Va I live just below Skyland Resort in Luray. On my way home from work as I crossed over the mountain at Thorton Gap I could see two large ball shaped objects appr. 2500 feet above the mountains. As I descended into the valley I could see them dancing in the sky above Skyline drive, moving in a North to South direction. At first the two objects appeared to be playing leap frog. After about 30 min the objects started changing colors from blue to green to yellow and then were joined by to other larger orange spheres. When the large two of the objects approached the smaller ones they all became the same color and hovered over the Big Meadows area. At about 5:30 am when the sun started to crest the mountain peaks the objects turned a pale blue and darted at a very high speed first down into the valley before charging straight up into the morning sky, they never slowed to change direction and they were faster then any vehicle I have ever seen. This is the second time I have seen this occur in 30 days, the first time I just thought I was crazy and tired. I will keep a further look out for these objects and report any more sightings.;38.6524;-78.4578
