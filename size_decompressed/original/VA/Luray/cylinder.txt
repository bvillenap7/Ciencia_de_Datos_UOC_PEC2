The object was seen from the road near Luray Caverns airport.  It was above a cloud over the New Market Gap.  It was shaped like a tube, it was bright shiny orange as if reflecting the sunset behind it.  A light flew out of it and then came back to the craft.   After about 5 minutes it disappeared. I was alone so I don't know if anybody else saw it.   Many years ago, in the early seventies, at Christmas, my family and I saw very bright lights in the same area.
