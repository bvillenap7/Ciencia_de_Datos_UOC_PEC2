I saw a slow, silent moving craft with 3 very large round lights in a semi-triangular pattern, flying lower  than a normal	 aircraft, but not extremely close to the ground either. The lights were so bright that you could make out the shape of the craft which also seemed to be semi-triangular. There are lots of trees around my house so I lost complete view after about 2 minutes.  Iâ€™ve seen planes at night before but never one like this.;36.6879395348837;-79.8685558139535
