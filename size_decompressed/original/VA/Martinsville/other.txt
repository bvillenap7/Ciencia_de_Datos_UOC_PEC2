About the size of a penny held at arm reach. Inverted triangle shape bright orange/yellow in color. Spotted low in the NNW sky as it moved in a SW direction. I am 50 years old, a Vietnam Marine Vet,and I have been employed at a local community college for the past 20 years,as a Audio Visual Manager. I have never seen anything like this befor. I would very much like to know what it was. Although I'm sure it wasn't a airplane or any type of aircraft I've seen before.;36.6879395348837;-79.8685558139535
