Dancing orb in the sky.;1970-06-30 19:45:00;15 seconds;Dancing orb in the sky An event that I still remember to this very day.  Waiting for the bus in the morning, and noticed in the sky a white orb.  I thought it was some sort of aircraft, but later realize its no ordinary craft.  This circular orb glide across the sky in a dancing motion, going up and down in ways that no craft could.  Shortly this object disappeared with a blink of an eye.

Three circular formations of green lights seemed to float in the sky around 7:00.;2016-02-17 19:00:00;~3 minutes;Three circular formations of green lights seemed to float in the sky around 7:00. I spotted three circular formations of green lights, two of them moved slowly while one stayed almost still.  They were about 5 bright green lights forming a circle with one red light at the end.  The one that was staying still seemed to be the lowest.  I stopped my truck while driving to see it and the vehicle behind me did the same.  It began to slowly move northwest.  I could not tell where the other two were moving. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));36.6879395348837;-79.8685558139535
