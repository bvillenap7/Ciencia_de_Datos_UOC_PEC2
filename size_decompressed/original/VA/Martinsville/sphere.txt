14 yellowish/orange spears with protruding glowing rod coming out the back;2011-10-30 19:25:00;30 minutes;14 yellowish/orange spears with protruding glowing rod coming out the back While sitting in our vehicle the 1st object appeared in the east.  It proceeded toward us and turned north.  We could see a glowing, protruding rod from rear of object.   Another object appeared from same direction, following the 1st object. We got out of the vehicle to observe.  We did not hear any noise.   Every 2 to 3 minutes another object would appear from all directions and slowly fly over and head in same general direction (north).   During the next 25 mins. or so 12 more objects were observed. One passed directly overhead and we were able to get 4 pics.  That object stopped turned red and elongated vertically.  When another object came close to it, it returned to original form. They both headed north.  These objects were within a 1/4 to 1/2 mile radius.  They were at least 30 ft. in diameter.  These were perfect rounded ember glowing lights with a smooth luminous edge all the way around them.  It was moving vertically and horizontally.  Wow what an experience!
