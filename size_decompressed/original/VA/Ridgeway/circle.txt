My home faces south and my driveway comes down hill from the west. I looked up my driveway to the west and saw a bright light through the clouds and said to myself there is the moon. It was pretty cloudy at the time. I then looked straight up and there was the moon behind some thick clouds so I looked back to the west and the light was still there. the light was bigger and brighter than any star in the sky, I mean a lot bigger and brighter. I said to myself there are no bright stars in the western sky so I focused really hard at the light while I shielded my eyes from my porch light and noticed it was actually moving all around, a little up a little right then back to the left. II then turned the light off and really focused and the object was leaving little trails of light, so I know it was moving. The light then grew dim and went out. I came back in the house and put shoes and a jacket on and posted to face book what I h! ad seen. I went back out and it was there again but a little further northwest. and it grew super bright, and almost looked oblong it was so bright and then it grew dim and went out again. I checked again a few minutes later and it was back again but even further northwest in the sky and was steadily moving away in a northwest direction......I did think I saw a shooting star but it was in a southern direction.;36.59;-79.87
