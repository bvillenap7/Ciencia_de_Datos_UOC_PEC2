four lights moving together;2006-11-11 23:15:00;1.5 minutes;Four lights moving together forming into one and then again spliting into four...kept moving at a rapid pace...I kept chasing it for 1.5 minutes after that it disappearedâ€¦ ((CORRESPONDENCE WITH WITNESS)) Dear Mr. ((name deleted)) It sounds to us as though they may have been advertising lights.  Is that a  possibility, do you think? Cordially, Peter Davenport, Director National UFO Reporting Center Washington State ((END)) ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE OF REPORT)) But the lights were moving...I saw it while driving...and disappeared after some time...the Disappearance is a part which was strange and also it was at night 11 and I dind't see the same lights while returning...   for sure they were not advertising lights...they were like 4 trinangular shape lights moving together...   Just my observation, as it was very strange.   Thanks for getting back.   regards ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM));38.9541131313131;-77.3830663299664
