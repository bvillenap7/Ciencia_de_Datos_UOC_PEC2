Parkway between Herndon and Sterling around 8:00pm when a rather large glowing object brought my eyes up to it.   As soon as my eyes were able to focus on it the the glowing circular object accelerated very rapidly traveling toward the north in a straight horizontal line and vanished.  It must have been going well into the thousands of miles an hour, but without knowing the size and altitude, I can only say  It made those fighter jets at the air show look slow.   By the way the object was considerably larger than the biggest star. There was no sound and no trail.   I will be reporting another siting from 06/07/07 which finally compelled me to report this.;38.9541131313131;-77.3830663299664
