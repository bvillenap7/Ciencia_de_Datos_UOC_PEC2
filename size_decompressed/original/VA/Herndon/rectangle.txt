Rectangle shaped object with blinking red and white lights in Herndon, VA;2008-11-26 06:00:00;30 mins;Rectangle shaped object with blinking red and white lights in Herndon, VA At about 6am the morning before Thanksgiving I was awoken by a loud noise outside of our apartment building.  Our building is near a rock quarry so I assumed the noise was from an oncoming truck carrying materials to/from the quarry.  I initially ignored the noise thinking it would pass and I could fall back asleep and not worry about the noise awaking my young child.  But the noise did not stop after 5-10 mins.   Finally, I went out onto my balcony and looked for the oncoming or idling truck, but there was none.  So I looked up and that's when I noticed the rectangle shaped object hovering above my building.   I sprinted back into our room to wake my husband and force him to come out into the cold to look into the sky.  He eventually agreed, looked and saw the object and stated its probably a helicopter.  But there are no rectangle shaped helicopters to my knowledge.   He later confessed that after coming back into the apartment he thought to himself a helicopter would be way more louder than that object.   I tried calling both the town police department and county department.  The town department told me I was out of their jurisdiction and the county department told me their system was down the day I called (about a week or two after the sighthing).   I'm not sure if this matters, but my apartment building is located near the Center for Innovative Technology building about 2 mins from the Dulles Airport.
