Ball of light at ROTC training;2006-10-07 02:00:00;5 min?;Ball of light at ROTC training This happened during an Army ROTC training weekend in a large wooded area on base.  While on a land navigation exercise in the woods at about 2 am, perhaps 3-ish, two other people in my fire team and I witnessed a large ball of light traveling slowly over the treetops. there was a very high pitched humming noise.  Our compasses were not working, but using terrain association we figured that it was heading roughly north/northeast, at maybe 10-20 mph.  It was moving much too slowly to be a missile or other projectile that I've ever seen, and was far too close to have been mistaken for a helicopter or an airplane.  We have not reported this incident to anyone, although I have heard from other cadets in the NR Battalion besides those in my squad/fireteam that saw the same object early that morning.   It passed almost over us, and I could not discern its shape, it was only a blob of light.;37.2431878260869;-80.4214043478261
