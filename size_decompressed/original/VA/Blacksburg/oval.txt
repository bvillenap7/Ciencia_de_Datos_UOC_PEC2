Bright green object seen in Blacksburg VA.;2002-07-21 22:34:00;15 minutes;Bright green object seen in Blacksburg VA. While my father and i were fishing one night we noticed an oval shaped light glowing in the sky.  We dismissed it as a helicopter and continued on with the job at hand when we noticed the object was hovering above us, but did not make a sound at all.  As we stared at the green oval of light, it began to move a very fast rate of speed.  In no time it was off in the distance, leaving a vapar trail of green light behind it.  There it stayed for what seemed like five minutes, then it began moving again.  This time it flew behind a cloud, at which time the cloud threw off a brilliant green light.  The object never came from behind the cloud, and within the hour the cloud had disapated. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  We presume the witness meant a year of 2002, not 1902, and we have amended the date above.  PD));37.2431878260869;-80.4214043478261
Large greenish glowing light moving very fast.;2011-11-09 19:00:00;3 seconds;Large greenish glowing light moving very fast. Was on bicycle heading west. After turning right I notice a large greenish glowing light heading very fast eastbound.  The object appeared about half the size of the full moon was traveling many times faster then any aircraft I’ve ever seen.  The shape of the object appeared to be a sphere or ellipsoid.  The altitude is unknown.   The object was first observed at about 50° above the horizon and escaped from view in about three seconds.   Object almost appeared to be falling from the sky.  The area has too much light pollution to observe any meteorites (though this object was way too massive to be a meteorite anyway).;37.2431878260869;-80.4214043478261
