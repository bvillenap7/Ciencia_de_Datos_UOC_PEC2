Nov. 14, 2009 - UFO sighting in Blacksburg, VA at approx. 5:45PM - 3 Lights, no movement, disappeared into thin air;2009-11-14 17:45:00;5 minutes;Nov. 14, 2009 - UFO sighting in Blacksburg, VA at approx. 5:45PM - 3 Lights, no movement, disappeared into thin air While driving on Price Fork from Radford, VA towards Blacksburg, VA at about 5:40-5:45 PM on Saturday, Nov. 14th, 2009 I noticed a formation of light in the sky from approximately the Snuffy's gas station until just before reaching Kips elementary school.  The weather conditions were clear skies at dusk - but with plenty of light in the skies to make out objects - blue skies, not complete nightfall. The object appeared to be approximately one mile in elevation and perhaps about two or three miles away from my location - straight shot.  Skies were clear, there is little to no air traffic over southwest Virginia and if there are planes then typically at very high elevations - so lights normally appear very small. The light formation was composed of three large, horizontally oriented, oval shaped lights that were relative close to one another, like my depiction below with parentheses, and the lights appeared to wrap around the structure. (                    )(                   )(                  )   Three things stuck out about the lights:   1) Lights made the structure appear much larger than any aircraft that would normally fly into the private airport that is located in Blacksburg - any aircraft that would be flying that low would be flying into or out of that airport  2) There were no red and blue flashing lights indicating the wing tips that would be required  3) The lights made no movement, they appeared to remain at the same point in the sky even as I drove closer towards them. Finally, the three lights simultaneously dimmed down, like a light dimmer switch you would have in a living room, rapidly until no lights remained.  At this point the sky was still light enough to make out the shape and color of any craft had the lights just been turned off, or if the lights were on the front of the craft and they had just turned a new direction that would not allow the lights to be seen anymore - but nothing remained in the sky.   I pulled into the Kips Elementary parking lot to inspect the sky but nothing was there, only two planes flying at very high altitudes not in the general vicinity of the sighting.   Whatever I saw just disappeared seemingly into thin air.;37.2431878260869;-80.4214043478261
Satellite like object too bright and not blinking (not a craft);2011-08-14 11:51:00;2 minutes;Satellite like object too bright and not blinking (not a craft) A single bright light that was too bright to be a satellite but it was not blinking and was clearly not an aircraft.  It did not follow an ecliptic. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));37.2431878260869;-80.4214043478261
Unusuall objects in the sky over Blacksburg, VA;2019-09-27 08:40:00;5 minutes;Unusuall objects in the sky over Blacksburg, VA On Friday, September 27, 2019 at approximately 8:40pm in Blacksburg, Virginia, I was outside walking my dog on the trail and as usual, looking up into the sky to see what I could see. My first thoughts of the night were who exactly gets to occupy which altitudes in the sky? Because I noticed several aircraft in the air that evening, some at extremely high altitudes and others seemingly occupying various other levels of the atmosphere.  One aircraft in particular, that I presume to be of the private variety local to the Virginia Tech airport was flying in unusual patterns with a green, white and red light on it. I had taken the time to watch it carefully because it appeared to be unusual compared to the other aircraft I am accustomed to seeing in the air at night.  Considering I observe a lot of aircraft in the sky, it’s a regular occurrence here in Blacksburg, this particular aircraft was behaving in a way that made me consider the possibility some kind of driver’s education, behind the wheel class was going on? A minute or so would pass as I continued walking down the path and I looked up into the sky again to see the most amazing things.  There were three objects in the sky, one at the 11, 12 and 2 o’clock positions and they appear to be on fire. They were clustered together, seemingly moving independent of one another but the object at the 2 o’clock position moved around freely, very firefly, serpentine like and appeared to change altitudes and directions efficiently. There was a rocket booster looking affect to the objects, but they were clearly emitting some kind of flame.  Unfortunately, I did not have my camera with me but I did sprint in vein in an attempt to get one. By that point, the objects were gone. The airplane I saw moving erratically in the sky no doubt was observing this same behavior and there was an uptick in traffic in my area immediately following the event, so I would have to think it was witnessed by more than just myself on ground level.;37.2431878260869;-80.4214043478261
