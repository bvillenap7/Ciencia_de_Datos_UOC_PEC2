I heard strange sounds coming from the sky.;2012-01-20 23:00:00;about 1 hour;I heard strange sounds coming from the sky. It was overcast, so I did not see anything.  What happened is that I heard groaning and windy sounds coming from the sky. I've never heard anything like it before.  It sounded spooky and I know that I could not be the only one who heard the sounds.;37.2899;-77.29
