Due to all the Vultures that were flying over head. I told him pretty high, as my son had seen one really high something had caught my eye. Just beyond where the bird was flying, was a stationary object that look like a sphere near the edge of the clouds. It was to the NE of where we were swimming around 30 thousand ft. I pointed it out to my kids and other kids that were with us, which everyone at this time saw it. It would get bright for a second then dim out to where you couldn’t  see it then appear again. We had watched for about 10 mins until it disappeared into some dense clouds and we couldn’t see it anymore. We had stayed another 20 mins hoping we would see it again, but nothing appeared.;37.2899;-77.29
