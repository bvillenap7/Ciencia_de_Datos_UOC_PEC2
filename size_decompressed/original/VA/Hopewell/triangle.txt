As I was pulling out of my driveway a light o my rigt caught my attention and then noticed a triangle shaped aircraft the next block over rise above the tree line and turned its direction away from me. I notice three white lights one in the front and two in the back with a red light in between the two in he back and it was flashing.   This was not a plane it was flying too low and no sound and so close it was crazy I had to question myself all day.;37.2899;-77.29

UFO above my home.;2014-02-17 22:30:00;10 minutes;UFO above my home I went outside because I heard a buzzing noise.  I was immediately drawn to the sky where there was a triangle aircraft hovering over the woods near my home.  There was 1 very bright light in each corner and the aircraft didn't move.   I stared in shock until it finally dawned on me that I was possibly looking at a UFO.   I ran inside, set the alarm on the house and locked all the doors.   The aircraft didn't dart off, it just disappeared after about 10 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Date in original report was flawed, indicating a date of December 17, 2014, which is not possible.
