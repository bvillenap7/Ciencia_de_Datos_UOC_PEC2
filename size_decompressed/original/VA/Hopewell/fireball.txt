Two witnesses saw a huge neon-green fireball travelling parallel to the ground, behind treetops, near Richmond VA on I-295;2000-07-31 21:00:00;3-5 secs;Two witnesses saw a huge neon-green fireball travelling parallel to the ground, behind treetops, near Richmond VA on I-295 Two witnesses in a car observed a large neon-green ball or fireball travelling at a high speed through the air.  The car was travelling on I-295 from Richmond, VA towards Petersburg, VA between 8:30 and 9:30 p.m.  It was extremely dark because of a storm.  I noted heat lightning.  The green ball followed a path that was parallel to I-295, parallel to our direction of travel (towards Petersburg), and parallel to the ground surface.  We could see about 2/3rds of the object behind the treetops adjacent to the highway.  I am a 46 year old female with a PhD in geology.  My passenger was a 10 year old Japanese American boy who shouted, Look, Godzilla, when we both saw the object.  My first impression was that it was a meteor, and looked like a speeding planet.  But it was travelling parallel to the ground.  Also, if a tail were present it was very small.  There could have been small bubble-like features close to the ball.;37.2899;-77.29
Large neon-green fireball, travelling parallel to I-295 (south) at 200 mph and parallel to ground, behind treetops, near Hopewell, VA;2000-07-31 22:00:00;3-5 secs;Large neon-green fireball, travelling parallel to I-295 (south) at 200 mph and parallel to ground, behind treetops, near Hopewell, VA I am resubmitting a report that I filed several weeks ago, since it is not yet posted on the website, and because I note that you are currently interested in sightings on July 31, 2000.  On the evening of July 31, 2000 I was travelling south on I295 between Richmond, VA and Petersburg, VA, with 1 passenger.  It was very dark and stormy and about 9 p.m..  The two of us observed what appeared to be a very large, neon-green fireball travelling south parallel to I295 at what appeared to be treetop level.  It was travelling faster than the highway traffic, probably at 200 miles per hour or so.  The lower third of it was hidden by the treetops.  It did not have a long tail, but could have had a very short tail.  Its surface appeared to have a lot of clear-colored small bubbles associated with it.  Its size was comparable to a lemon held at arm's length.  I thought it was a meteor at first.  After thinking about it for several months, I considered the possibility that it might be a UFO.  The reasons for this are as follows: 1) it was travelling parallel to the ground, not arcing down 2) it did not have a well-defined tail 3) it appeared very large, and appeared to be at a very low altitude.  I am a geologist (PhD) and I knew that if a bolide of this size and scale hit the earth, it would cause a catastrophic event.  I figured that astronomers would have noticed it and reported on it. I heard nothing reported. The alternative explanation is that we were looking at the base or side of a UFO.  Since I do not know if you received my last report, please notify me when you  receive this.  My passenger was a 10 year old boy.  If the object was a meteor, it was gargantuan in scale, and looked like a planet speeding past.  Near Richmond airport.;37.2899;-77.29
