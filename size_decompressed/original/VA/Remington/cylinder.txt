Silver metallic object observed on low level flight.;2018-02-21 14:10:00;5 seconds;Silver metallic object observed on low level flight. I was in my back yard which is open and looks into my neighbor's back pasture at about 1410 hours.  There was a bright sunshine with almost no clouds present.  I caught sight of a silver object, in flight, moving at a high rate of speed across the neighbor's pasture.  The object appeared to be a bright metallic silver color and cylinder shaped.  I would estimate the size of the object to be 3 foot tall by 2 foot wide.  The vehicle was travelling from the SSE to the NNW and appeared to be flying a set altitude from ground level which would vary according to the topography of the pasture.   I was, at most 1000 feet from the object at my initial observation and 75 feet from the object when it disappeared over the neighbor's house and trees.  There were no discernible markings or features to be seen on the object.  No sounds were heard that would have indicated a conventional propulsion system.  There were no anomalies noted that could relate to the sighting.  A! lthough a short duration observation I was able to estimate the speed of the object by calculating the distance seen in flight versus the time of observation.  The vehicle was travelling approximately 250 MPH.   Coincidentally, this sighting occurred the same day as the USAF's NORAD was engaged in a training exercise in the DC area Falcon Virgo 18-05. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sober-minded, and sincere.  We suspect that he is an excellent witness.  PD));38.5304;-77.8035
