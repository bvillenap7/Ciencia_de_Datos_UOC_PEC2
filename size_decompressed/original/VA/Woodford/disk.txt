This evening, 7/31/2017, at approximately 9:15 p.m. EDT, he reports seeing a blue/green disc tracked by laser lights from two high-power helicopters approximately 700-800 feet up.  His estimate is that it was located over Virginia Route 2 approximately where it meets VA Route 745 (Widewake Rd).  This is about Â½ mile from our location to the west on Long Branch RD. One thing that should be noted is that Fort AP Hill (a US Army training facility) is located just to the east across Route 2, and their latest air field/landing strip is located near the western boundary just south of this area.;38.0847;-77.4399
