Large, unknown silver  object near Dulles stationary.;2012-11-11 15:50:00;30 seconds;Large, unknown silver  object near Dulles - stationary On 11/11/12 I was driving to work in Leesburg, Va. At approximately 3:50pm, I noticed as I was looking towards Dulles Airport, what appeared to be at first glance a 747 headed towards dulles to land.   As I continued to look, I noticed 2 things.  I thought it was too large to be a 747 and that it wasn't moving. I had to take the Lansdowne Blvd. exit within about 30 seconds of spotting the object and when I searched again after getting off the exit, I couldn't see it due to the trees and buildings blocking that area. I was able to grab my camera and take a photo at full zoom. I'm sure with some analysis it can be determined if it is a 747.  The only alternatives I can think of are a blimp or balloon, though in my own mind, I don't think so.It was gray, shiny and metallic looking. If anyome else saw this, I'd love to know.I'll look for more posts.;39.1215241573033;-77.5663488764046
