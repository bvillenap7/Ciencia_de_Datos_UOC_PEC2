TRANSPARENT, TRIANGULAR  SHAPED  OBJECT;2001-02-21 22:00:00;6  seconds;TRANSPARENT, TRIANGULAR  SHAPED  OBJECT I WAS  WALKING MY DOG  ON  A  CLEAR  STAR  LIT  NIGHT. I  GAZED  UP  AT  THE  S KY AND NOTICED A  TRIANGULAR  SHAPED FORMATION  OF  LIGHTS. THERE  WERE  THREE NON  FLASHING WHITE   LIGHTS  ON  EACH  SIDE  OF  THE  TRIANGLE. THE  OBJECT  APPEARED  COMPLETLY  TRANSPARENT  LOOKING  WITH STARS  STILL  VISIBLE  IN BACKGROUND, NO  AUDIBLE  SOUND WAS  HEARD. IT  VANISHED  AS  QUICKLY  AS  IT  APPEARED. THE TIME DURATION  OF  THE OBJECT  WHICH  TRAVELED  EAST  TO  WEST  WAS  6  SECS. THE  OBJECT  APPEARED  TO  MISTAKINLY  BE  VISIBLE  AND LONG  BEFORE  IT  REACHED  THE  HORIZON  THE  OBJECT  TURNED  OFF ITS  LIGHT  AS  IF  IT  HAD  A  CLOAKING  DEVICE. THE  OBJECT  WAS  AT  A LOWER  ALTITUDE  THEN  THE  THREE  COMMERCIAL  AIRLINERS  FLYING  IN  THE  AREA. DULLES  INTERNATIONAL  AIRPORT  IS  12  MILES  AWAY, WHICH  LEADS  ME  TO  BELEIVE  THAT  THE  OBJECT  WAS  FLYING  UNDER  RADAR  DETECTION. THE  OBEJECT  APPEARED  TO  BE  300  TO  500  FT.  ABOVE  VISIBLE  TREE  LINES  AND  ROOF  TOPS.  I  ESTIMATED  THE  SIZE  OF  THE  CRAFT  TO  BE  3  TO  5  TIMES  LARGER  THEN  COMMERCIAL  AIRLINER.;39.1215241573033;-77.5663488764046
