Cluster of orange lights on east coast between Baltimore and Washington.;2014-02-08 21:35:00;3 minutes;Cluster of orange lights on east coast between Baltimore and Washington We (2 people, 53 and 17) saw a cluster of orange lights.  Four or five were very close together and could be covered by two fingers held at arms length.  One was lower in the sky about 4 fingers width.  And two or three others were within a hand width of the main cluster.  They were at a bearing of about 80 degrees from my zip code and roughly 20 to 25 degrees above the horizon.  I am an engineer.   I have seen numerous planes lined up to approach a large airport (like Las Vegas or Dulles) and this formation did not resemble anything like that.  In addition they were gone when I stopped the car at home 90 seconds later to get a better look.  They all appeared roughly stationary.  I was driving our car east and was near home.  Once I got home, I hurried to get some binoculars and ran upstairs and they had all disappeared except one and it faded shortly after I found it in the binoculars.  I have never seen lights I could not explain and I believe these must have been military, but I have no idea what they were since they didn't have the light characteristics of a helicopter and were too stationary for planes.  I expected to find an explanation in the news this morning and reports of other people seeing the same thing, but when I didn't, I was surprised and decided to post the sighting here.  As an engineer with a technical background in physics I believe visits from a foreign world are impossible to our planet.  These had an earthly origin, but I have no idea what it was.;39.1215241573033;-77.5663488764046

A single red light travels across the night sky before disappearing.;2015-07-04 22:00:00;2 minutes;A single red light travels across the night sky before disappearing. This is a more accurate and updated version of a previous report.  The object appeared as a single red light.  It was not blinking- but flickering.  Shimmering like a star.  The light proceeded to move horizontally across the night sky, without making noise, until it suddenly shot up vertically until it was out of sight.  It made no noise.;39.1215241573033;-77.5663488764046
