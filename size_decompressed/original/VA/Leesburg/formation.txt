3 rapidly blinking (shimmering) lights in formation;2011-05-25 21:15:00;3-5 mins.;3 rapidly blinking (shimmering) lights in formation While outside I noticed a rapidly blinking object, about the size of a star (to show how high it must have been).  There werent really any colors, it was rapidly blinking, much like a crystal in the light, sparkling.   While looking at this one for about 1 minute later I saw another and another, three of them in formation moving parallel with one another in formation all blinking the same way, but NOT at the same time.   Once I saw 3 of them in perfect formation I called my friend out to observe them, the clouds were coming and had covered up the furthest one (or the one on the bottom of the formation) but she saw 2 of them in formation.   She insisted they were planes simply in formation, but as they went by we saw a plane very high up as well and could easily be identified as one.   Then we watched until the other 2 had gone into the cloud as well, we waited and waited for about 15 minutes because there was just one large cloud and then a clearing but after I had w! aited for another 20 minutes I had realized that they were gone.

16+ Orange Blumes in scatter straight line moving from the northwest to southeast;2012-11-22 21:00:00;7 minutes;16+ Orange Blumes in scatter straight line moving from the northwest to southeast After returning froma Thanksgiving dinner, in the south eastern sky, approx 16 orange blums were seen in a scatter straight line formation, moving fromthe northwest to southeast. We thought these could be Chinese Lanterns but they were to large and could be seen for 7 - 10 miles away. Should have pass right over or to the south of Washinton Dulles Airport.
