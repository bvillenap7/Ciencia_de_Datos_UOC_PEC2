Object with cone shaped tail rises above Dulles, VA.  ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));2009-09-19 19:50:00;20 seconds;Object with cone shaped tail rises above Dulles Virginia In the mostly-clear, east by southeastern sky about 60 degrees above the horizon, my daughter and I saw a bright white object emitting a hollow cone of light as it appeared to be rising vertically at a very high altitude.  The object was in the general vicinity of Dulles Airport, but appeared to be much too high, much too bright, and moving in the wrong direction to be airplane landing lights.  In addition, the lights disappeared from sight vertically.  The object was only about 10-15 degrees away from a planet we believe to be Jupiter, and we noted its relative size and brightness to be similar to slightly larger than that of Jupiter.  A massive cone of white light first appeared below the object, then brightened and grew in size as the object rose vertically.  The object and its' cone of white light disappeared from view after 15-20 seconds.  We estimated the cone of light to have reached a length 30 times the size of the object and was brighter than any manmade light we have ever seen, with the exception of a Cape Canaveral rocket launch.  There was no sound. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));39.1215241573033;-77.5663488764046
