My family went on a walk after dinner and we thought it was a shooting star but it was much closer and larger, it was a large green streak going from east to west travelling almost horizontally but heading south(but not a flare and not like a missile you see on news coverage) with a  larger concentration at the head of it (perhaps a fireball) and we assumed it was a meteor instead of a falling star, due to its volume...we use to live on the prairie in Canada and saw falling stars all the time, but this was quite large....and beautiful..sadly we saw no other reports of any meteors falling but we could only imagine when this one landed someone would know about it.;39.1215241573033;-77.5663488764046

Movement could be described as shooting downwards.  Knowledge of where, or if, the object made contact with the ground was unclear, as the vehicle had approached  a wooded area and the object was no longer visible.  Although impossible to determine size, was substantially larger than a shooting star and appeared much closer both to the individuals witnessing and to the ground.  There was no apparent sound.   There were several planes in the general vicinity, (the closet was slightly further west and traveling northbound), due to proximity to two airports within a 12 mile radius of driver and passenger in vehicle (The Leesburg executive airport and Dulles International  airport.)   Within ten minutes several helicopters had been heard by three adults, and confirmed by several social med! ia comments of people in the area.;39.1215241573033;-77.5663488764046
