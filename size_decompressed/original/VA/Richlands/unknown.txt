MAYBE A DOZEN FIREWORKS HAD BEEN FIRED UP INTO THE SKY WHEN I NOTICED IT.  AS I WATCHED IT, IT TURNED 90 DEGREES TO THE SOUTHWEST.  THE LIGHT WAS NOT AS FAST FLASHING AS A PLANE.  IT TRAVELED A FEW SECONDS IN THIS DIRECTION AND THEN BEGAN TO ZIG-ZAG AROUND SEVERAL TIMES.  EACH TIME IT CHANGED DIRECTION, ITS LIGHT WOULD DISAPPEAR BRIEFLY.  AFTER SEVERAL DIFFERENT ZIG-ZAGS, IT CAME BACK TO ITS ORIGINAL POSITION WHEN IT FIRST TURNED AND RESUMED IT'S SOUTHEAST-NORTHWESTLY ROUTE.  I WATCHED IT TRAVEL TOWARDS THE LAST TWO STARS IN THE BIG DIPPER AND SHORTLY THEREAFTER, IT DISAPPEARED.  MY WIFE SAW IT AND A YOUNG BOY BEHIND US.  THERE WERE MAYBE 60-70 PEOPLE SITTING ON THE HILL BUT NOT MANY SAW IT AS THEY WERE WATCHING THE FIREWORKS.;37.0954;-81.8116
