The 1st of 3 large lights rose above mtn. no sound, it took about 5 min to disappear, straight up. Light could be seen shining threw the trees on the top of the mountain.  I thought it was th moon getting ready to come up. Slowely a big light could be seen in the trees. I told wife I thought a helicopter was up there looking at the area of the airplane crash.  However, the light at about a mile away looked about half the size of the moon and was about as bright as the moon on a clear night.  There was no sound, I became more curious as the second light came up.  then the third.  They appeared to be a couple hundred yards apart. they started picking up speed, going almost straight up.  These were big lights, maybe as big a a hundred feet across.  they kept going faster and fast, getting smaller un till they looked like blinking stars and they were gone.--------I did not ever think I would report this, but since I got a computer I have found a lot of things in it.
