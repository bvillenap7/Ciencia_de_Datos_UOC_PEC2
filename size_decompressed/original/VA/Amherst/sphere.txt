Large orange orb.;2011-08-28 18:00:00;2 minutes;Large orange orb. My wife and I were in the woods just after a storm.  We kept noticing lighting in the same general area through the trees.   I told my wife that if we went out into the field that was across the street we would see a ufo.  I was half joking when I said this but later she said she was thinking the same thing.   We were both shocked when just as we emerged into the clearing we saw what at first looked to me like a planes landing gear light in the southern sky just above the tree line.  It was orange and stationary at first.   It seemed to respond to my thoughts.   As I focused on it, it grew larger and brighter apearing to stay stationary.  It apeared to be about the size of a full moon.  Then it grew dimmer and slowly moved to the east.   I started running into the field to get a better look and it moved faster.  It traveled behind some trees and dissapeared.  The object made no sound. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));37.602;-79.046
