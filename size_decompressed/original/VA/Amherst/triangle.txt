And  I  looked  out  the  window  and  saw  a  kind  of  yellow  ball  moving  around  the  side  of  a  mountain.  I  watched  as  it  started  to  move  kind  of  up  but  at  an angle  and  it  went  up  to  the  sky.  And  that  was  when  I  noticed  the  big  one.  It  was  3  blue  flourecent  lightes  in  the  shape  of  a  triangle.  The  one  that  had  come  off  the  mountain   flew  up  to  it  and  disappered.  And  starred  athe  triangle  I  have  no  idea  how  high  it  was  up  in  the  air.  But  any  way  then  more  balls  of  light  started  to  come  to  it  and  disapper, while  at  the  same  time  I  noticed  it  was  also  kind  of  like  shooting  more  out.  And  this  lasted  till  I  fell  asleep  again  mind  you  this  wasn't  the  first  time  I  had  seen  anything  like  this. But  this  one  was  just  so  much  grander  in  amazement.   I  thank  you  for  your  time . ((NUFORC Note:  We question whether this is an accurate, or serious, report, but that is a guess.  We suspect the witness meant a date in 1998, not 1899, but even that date creates some confusion, given that the report was submitted in February 1998.  We are confused.  PD));37.602;-79.046
