silver cigar shaped craft NO WINGS;2013-10-24 12:00:00;5 minutes;silver cigar shaped craft NO WINGS I witnessed a silver cigar shaped craft being followed by a white commercial aircraft with red stripe.  The commercial aircraft was following the cigar shaped craft on the same flight path, the distance between the two craft was approximately just under a mile if not a full mile.  The cigar craft was all silver no with  absolutely no wings.  The cigar shaped craft looked to be almost the same length as the commercial plane, maybe a little longer. It was very shiny do to the sunlight shinning off of it.  The sky at the time I noticed the two craft, the sky was completely clear.  I did not here any sound do to the height of these craft, i was about 100 yards away from a road at a busy time of day (too much noise from passing vehicles)  How does something fly with no wings??????;38.6495513605442;-77.319244217687
