I saw a v shaped ,silent object moving very quicky in the night sky.;2009-12-10 17:50:00;5 seconds;I saw a v shaped ,silent object moving very quicky in the night sky. I was taking my dog, Sparky, out for a walk at approx. 17:50 hrs on 12/10/09 in the back common area of my townhouse complex.  It was dark at that time, and as I was passing through the opening of two end units, I heard a power hand saw being used by a resident on his rear deck of the townhouses backing up to the drainage ditch which I was approaching from the opposite side.  The sound stopped and I saw him walk back inside his house as I reached the spot where I let my dog loose to run and fetch the ball (I know its dark, but I throw it to a spot across the ditch, just like I have done hundreds of times before). After I threw the ball, I have about 40 seconds before she returns with it, I looked up in the sky just to see the stars on this clear and crisp evening.  Panning the sky to the north, I saw what at first looked like a tighter that usual grouping of faint stars, a shallow V of an angle approx. 135 degrees to the backside of the V.  The V shape wasnâ€™t a group of stars, because it was moving from the north to the south.  There were 5-6 dimmer than a star lights on each arm of the V and a gap of no lights to the front of the V.  The dark frontal gap was approx one-seventh the size of the V.  I spotted it approx 30 degrees from vertical where I was standing and tracked it moving south for only 5-6 seconds before it went dim.  It went dim before it was obscured by the height of the roofs of the townhouses across the ditch. Total view angle was approx 90-100 degrees. The height was hard to determine as I had seen nothing like it before to compare the size, although planes come from various directions regularly coming of going to Dulles or Reagan airport.  The speed seemed very fast even if it was low, but in the relative quiet moment of the evening as it was, I heard not a whisper of sound before, during or after the craft passed overhead.  It may have been higher than I thought but the speed would have been even faster to move across that span of sky.;38.6495513605442;-77.319244217687
