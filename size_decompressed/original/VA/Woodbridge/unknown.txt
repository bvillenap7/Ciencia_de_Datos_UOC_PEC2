massive object falling from the sky and disappearing suddenly before impact;2019-10-13 23:35:00;2 minutes;massive object falling from the sky and disappearing suddenly before impact I heard a loud and massive noise over our home, something similar to a big engine noise. It woke me up. It was like something big falling from the sky and about to crash on us.  I was expecting an impact due to the noise coming closer and closer super fast.  Suddenly a voum sound gave the impression that it was going into another direction and all sounds stopped suddenly, nothing after that (that thing left in less than a second).  It was not the usual airplane sound, it was not an helicopter sound.  But this was flying. There is noway an airplane could drop down on us like that without a crash.  It could not have been a drone, the steady sound was massive.  I could not see anything from the window after the event.  I thought something was falling on us.  I remained in bed super scared and got up minutes after that.  I couldn't see anything abnormal outside or in the sky after that.;38.6495513605442;-77.319244217687
