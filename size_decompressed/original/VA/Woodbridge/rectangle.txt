Two objects, rectangular in shape, were flying in a semi-circular pattern.  I was only able to distinguish them once they were going away from me.  I guess looking at the back end, I could see a bright red light, and only the light.  The light didn't blink, but just faded in and out over time.  I couldn't see the whole flight because trees behind my house blocked the whole view.  But I did see the back end of the pattern four times before I went inside my house.  There were several minutes between sightings.  I could also hear a low rumbling, almost like a jet engine, but it was constant, never really fading too much as the object went away, and didn't really get louder as it came close.  I don't know if this was alien but I don't know what it is.;38.6495513605442;-77.319244217687
