7 fireballs hovering high over Woodbridge, VA.;2014-07-16 07:00:00;5 minutes;7 fireballs hovering high over Woodbridge, VA. My friend and I had been skateboarding out front of my house when I had noticed 7 stationary fireballs in the sky, with no particular formation, behind the treeline.  I asked him what he thought they were and he laughed it off saying Huh, maybe it's a UFO, man and continued skating.  I ignored his comment and kept my gaze locked on them for about 5 minutes, watching them disappear one by one. I have also had people tell me of abduction experiences involving my back yard, with them having no prior knowledge of the abduction phenomena, coinciding totally with public accounts.;38.6495513605442;-77.319244217687
