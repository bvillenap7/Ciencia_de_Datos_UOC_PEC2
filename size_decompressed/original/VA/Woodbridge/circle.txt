BRIGHT OBJECTS  CHASED INTO BELMONT BAY;1975-11-13 21:15:00;10 min;BRIGHT OBJECTS  CHASED INTO BELMONT BAY a friend,my sister& myself were walking in my neighborhood when my friend      looked up &said LOOK AT THOSE LIGHTS! MY SIS & SELF looked up & saw 2 bright lights hovering in the eastern sky. they stayed in that position then started turning blue , orange ' red then white again . then smaller red lights came out of the white lights then the lights started to descend to below the tree line.  just as they got towards the treeline two military jets came THUNDERING  to the area where we saw the lights were on the treeline. they disappeared down under the treeline. meanwhile the mil. jets seemed to be fixed on the area where we lost sight of them but a man who lived on BELMONT BAY which was from our view the treeline  went on a special on WTTG TV in washington dc about the events & said the objects went into the bay as the mil. jets approached them. from whati saw & what he said he saw they matched PERFECT .I  dont remember the military's excuse for being there or what they said it was but they were just as interested in the lights as we were.maybe you could get that special from wttg tv's archives itwas titled i think strange lights over washington dc. i feel bad for the man because they made him out to be a kook but 2 other people & myself saw the same thing at the same time. i was 11 or 12 at the time & didnt tell anyone because i diddnt think anyone would believe me. so the 3 of us just talked about amongst ourselves until it just kind of faded in to memory!

3 objects over Northern Virginia;2009-11-16 19:58:00;10 seconds;3 objects over Northern Virginia While taking my dog out, I was looking up at the sky to check for any meteors (Due to the shower that is happening tonight).  While scanning the sky, I noticed moving East to West, three objects in a triangular pattern.  These objects were circular in shape, had a halo like effect with the center of them as dark as the sky around them.  The skies this evening are clear.  They moved a speed about as fast as a regional plane, but were completely silent.  Within about a half a mile from my sight, they started to shift formation and kind of intertwined each other. They may have gone about a mile West in my view, and then for a lack of better words, vanished. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
