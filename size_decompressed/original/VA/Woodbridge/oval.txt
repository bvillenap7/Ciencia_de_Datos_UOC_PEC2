Tan and Shiny object;2006-01-22 09:44:00;2 minutes;Tan and Shiny object There was one bright ligthed object flying right above my house. I dont know what it is but it looked tan and shiny. i saw it coming too, it came really fast and it was revolving around above our neighberhood for about 2 or 3 minutes. Than when i reached to take a picture of it it went away as fast as possible and then i never saw it again.;38.6495513605442;-77.319244217687
I was driving through Woodbridge, VA, south-bound on I-95 when I saw the green globe that lasted just short of two minutes.;2017-01-21 18:40:00;2 minutes;I was driving through Woodbridge, VA, south-bound on I-95 when I saw the green globe that lasted just short of two minutes. It was very much like the color of a green traffic light, only much, much larger and it was very high in the sky.  It was not an even shade of bright green.  It was brighter in the center and grew darker as the light approached its edges.  While it is very foggy tonight, the fog did not diminish the intensity of the light in any way.  There was only one globe and it suddenly went out like it was never there.;38.6495513605442;-77.319244217687
