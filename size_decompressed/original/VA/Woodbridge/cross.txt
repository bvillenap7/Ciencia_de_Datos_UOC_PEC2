UFO flying high in sky moving all four directions for a prolonged period of time;2011-07-11 03:00:00;20 mins;UFO flying high in sky moving all four directions for a prolonged period of time i was standing on my balcony looked up and saw what i thought was a star but i stared at it, it started moving up and closer to my direction....fyi i cant really tell u how far it was it had to be at least somewhere as far as 10-25 miles northeast of my position.  But then it went backwards and away, then went to the right and then to the left, as if it was hovering and thought i saw a beam of light, light the beam of light from a flashlight only alot further away and alot more dim, and it seemed to do that up until i decided to write this letter, anyways i felt compeled to write this cuz i've thought i'vs seen some activity like this a long time ago and just never thought to write.  And its shape looked as if it was an  X or cross shape and had four points of light, one on each side shining out....ok there ya go! Lol;38.6495513605442;-77.319244217687
