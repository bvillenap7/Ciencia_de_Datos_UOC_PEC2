Fice bright orange objects in sky seen moving slowly and sparadically upwards and also horizontal.  No set pattern, and sometimes they remain stationary.  Were way too close together to be helicopters.  Were too bright to be chinese candles, as they were over 1 mile away and were very bright.;38.6495513605442;-77.319244217687

In the sky it was pretty cloudy out and raining there were 4 bright lights moving in a circle.  They would come out and in and then circle again.I tried recording and taking pictures, but they all look blank.  I called my family to ask if they can see from 4 hours away where they are and they couldn't.;38.6495513605442;-77.319244217687
14-24 CRAFT WITH WHITE/ORANGE LIGHTS IN FORMATION FOLLOWING EACH OTHER;2020-08-02 21:30:00;8-10 minutes;14-24 CRAFT WITH WHITE/ORANGE LIGHTS IN FORMATION FOLLOWING EACH OTHER I WENT OUT TO WALK THE DOGS AND STARTING APPEARING IN A LINE FOLLOWING EACH OTHER FROM THE WEST TO THE EAST, IN FORMATION AT ABOUT THE SAME DISTANCE FROM EACH OTHER.  THEY TURNED AND HEADED NORTH AND BACK TO THE WEST AND DISAPPEARED.  THEY WERE ALL ALLUMINATED IN WHITE TO A PINK COLOR AND MADE NT SOUND AT ALL.  AT THE POINT THAT THEY TURNED BACK WEST I COULD SEE ANOTHER CRAFT WITH GREEN BLINKING LIGHST COMING FROM THE NORTH, HIGHER THEN THE CRAFTS AND DOWN TO WHERE THE CRAFTS STATED TURNING BACK TO THE WEST.  I WAS AS IT WAS DIRECTING THE OTHERS CRAFTS THAT WAS MUCH BIGGER.  THEN THEY ALL JUST DISAPPEARED. I  RETIRED FROM THE ARMY WITH 32 YEARS (ACTIVE AND RESERVE) AND I HAVE NEVER SEEN AN CRAFT LIKE THIS WITH NO SOUND AT ALL.;38.6495513605442;-77.319244217687
