Four red glowing lights in a formation (lined up).;2012-07-08 22:12:00;5 minutes;Four red glowing lights in a formation (lined up). Me and my cousin were on our way to Wall mart when we were close to the traffic light we spotted four glowing lights floating in the sky in a formation (lined up).  The lights were red. I took my cellphone and started recording them, then I kept driving and recording but I thought that I might crash if I kept driving so I stop in a shopping center where another person was recording as well (a 40 yrs lady).  When I got out of the vehicle I started recording but three of them had disapeared but one was still flying over us. then at the end the last one just dissaperead as if it was going to the outer space.  I took a video with a samsung galaxy s2, the quality is not the best but is real. here is the link  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zpPPlrdTNA&feature=g-upl;38.6495513605442;-77.319244217687
