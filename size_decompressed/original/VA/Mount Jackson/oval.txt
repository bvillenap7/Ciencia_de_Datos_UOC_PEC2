Bright fast moving oval object making sudden 90 degree turn;2020-06-11 20:55:00;less than 15 seconds;Bright fast moving oval object making sudden 90 degree turn I photographed an object outside my home on June 11th 2020, at 8:55pm just after sunset (sunset was 20:39:44). It was moving faster than a plane, similar in speed to how the ISS moves across the sky, heading due North and it was illuminated and incredibly bright, like it was on fire. It never lost its intensity. I saw no tail but assumed it was my vantage point as it was approaching head-on. I was positive I was witnessing a fireball until it suddenly took a 90 degree turn eastward, and like a cannon, shot away. I could track it past the clouds visible in the picture to the left until it absolutely vanished from sight.  I am an amateur ISS/satellite watcher so I immediately checked to see what objects were scheduled to make an appearance in my area, and there were none at that time. I also reported it to the American Meteor Society and have checked there periodically and see no other reports anywhere in my area of similar sightings. It’s marked as an invali! d sighting. I’m still amazed and baffled by the immediate turn this object made and the speed at which it flew away.;38.7871;-78.6847
