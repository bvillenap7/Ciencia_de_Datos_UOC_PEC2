The disc came in slow about 45 degrees above the horizon.  It appeared to be approximately 2000 feet in altitude.  It disappeared on its southerly trajectory for 1 second.  The disc then reappeared and accelerated at an ungodly speed due west over the Massanutten Mountain range.  I stayed out for 15 more minutes but the object was long gone at that point.  No other activity.;39.0345;-78.2811
