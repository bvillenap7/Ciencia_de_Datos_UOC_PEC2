Simultaneous flashes of lights;2012-11-03 20:15:00;30-60 seconds;Simultaneous flashes of lights I was driving down I-81 southbound near mile marker 303 close to the middletown exit ramp and while driving i noticed multiple flashes of light in the sky.  I would roughly guess 30-40 flashes simultaniously then just stopped and saw no more.  after witnessing this i called my father who is a air traffic controller and retired marine to ask if he knew of anything that would cause this and from what i described he said there is nothing he knows of that could cause what i had seen but after discussing it some more with him we summed it up to pyrotechnics of some sort until i arrived at my destination about 10 miles from mile marker 303 in Front Royal, VA and i told my fiance what i had seen and what my father and i had discussed and what we summed it up to be until her sister said she and her friend saw something similar around the time i had witnessed. after learning this pyrotechnics were out of the question and there is nothing to explain it.;39.0345;-78.2811
