Dozens of lights moving in single-filed formation flying east;2021-05-08 21:30:00;1:30;Dozens of lights moving in single-filed formation flying east It was a clear sky and I looked out the window with my night vision to see stars and satellites more clearly.  Through the scope I noticed multiple lights moving in formation. I look with my eyes and there are what seem to be 50-100 lights flying in a single file formation headed east. I was completely shocked. It almost looked like auto tracer rounds fired in the sky but the lights kept going and these lights were moving along a horizontal plane. I was able to take a picture where you can see the lights moving. I tried filming through my night vision scope but only got about a secondsâ€™ worth of seeing the objects. I was clearly fumbling because of my disbelief.  There were no sounds, no blinking lights, and no trails. They were moving very quickly up until I lost site of them because of a tree line blocking my view.;38.9637;-77.6099
