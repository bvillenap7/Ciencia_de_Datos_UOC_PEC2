I looked at it for a bit, then stepped out to see how bright the other stars were and to see if I could identify a constellation for reference.  The stars were not bright at all so I wondered if I would hear about this in the news later.  Then as I was watching it started to slowly move, as it moved closer the bright light appeared to be 3 or 4 lights in the center.  At first I thought it might just be a Harrier as it appeared to be over the vacinity of Mt. Weather, VA along the Shenandoah River.  Then I realized the lights were clustered with blinking red lights around that and a few white lights on the outer perimeter.  It came almost directly over me and I know airplanes, I worked at an FBO and there were no outer wings lights, tail or nose lights.  I could determine no shape whatsoever.  I heard it, it was a muffled plane sound.  It was not a chopper.  It went over the house and I went in.  I just kept thinking about it and I am sending this to you and do wish I had grabed my camera or my phone for photo.;39.14;-77.7346
