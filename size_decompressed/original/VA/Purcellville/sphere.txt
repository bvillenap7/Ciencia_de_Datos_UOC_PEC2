Red Orb 4th of July Purcellville, VA with video link;2013-07-04 21:15:00;30 seconds;Red Orb 4th of July Purcellville, VA with video link Red orb appeared just before the local fireworks, came out from behind one tree line, over the highway, and behind another tree line in a straight silent line.   Color changed from red to white to red.   Video is from bridge over highway, and it moved SE to NW direction (opposite of wind) and TOWARD the mountains.  Kids who saw movie, Tangled, thought it was a paper lantern, thus the comment in the video (also being e-mailed).  http://s25.photobucket.com/user/ladyangel944/library/Contact;39.14;-77.7346
