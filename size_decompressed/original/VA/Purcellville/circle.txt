There wasn’t a single cloud in the sky.  I noticed something about half way through the cigarette, a little tiny light in the sky appeared from the right side of the Eastern night time sky.. My first impression was “It’s probably a plane”  But I noticed the tiny orb that looked EXACTLY like a star,(And had no flashing lights of any kind)  It was moving across the sky a little faster than an airplane usually fly’s.  The altitude of the orb seemed way too high for a plane to physically reach. There was absolutely no sound around whatsoever. The orb traveled towards the left side of the Eastern skies, moving in a strange pattern, I guess the most accurate word for it would be “Semi-Zig Zag patterns”  After watching it for a good 2 minutes, It slowly disappeared as it made a turn going even HIGHER into the nighttime sky. (At this point I knew for sure what I saw was NO airplane, & certainly NOT a comet)  The object was also both accelerating and slowing down a few times, but not drastically.  It shined a bright light that made it look like a “perfect star” about half way through the sky.  Then slowly began to fade towards the end of the second minute. I checked several times after, & stared at the sky where it disappeared, hoping to see it again, but it never came back.;39.14;-77.7346
