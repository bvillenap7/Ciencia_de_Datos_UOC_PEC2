Sphere observed in Frying Pan section of Russell Co, VA;2012-10-16 14:34:00;10 minutes;Sphere observered in Frying Pan section of Russell Co, VA While making deliveries at an underground coal mine, I was meeting with mine personnel in the supply yard and noticed a very bright light shining against a clear blue sky.  I pointed the object out to all mine personnel that was around me and we observed the object for approximatly 10 minutes.   The object was stationary and &quotpulsed&quot with brightness about every 30 seconds or so.  We continued to watch the object until mine activities forced us to move.   I videoed with an Iphone approx. 42 seconds of the event.;36.9343;-82.3452
