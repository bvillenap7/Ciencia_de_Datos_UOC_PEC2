Saw two orange balls shape objects in the sky flying east over the Front Royal Airport area.;2015-07-18 21:00:00;15 minutes;Saw two orange balls shape objects in the sky flying east over the Front Royal Airport area.  They were close and separated by about 1,000 feet and looked to be about 1,000 feet off the ground.  Thought is was odd they did not have a sound and did not have blinking lights to signify an aircraft.  They flew west to east and out of site.  5 minutes later saw the exact same think with the exact same flight path.  Waited for 20 minutes to see if it would happen again but did not see it again.   Called the airport and they did not know of anything flying over.;38.9301;-78.1887000000001
