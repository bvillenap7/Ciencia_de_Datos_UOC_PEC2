I was distracted while I made a turn to family dollor wharehouse , after making the turn I looked back and the orb was gone . The weather conditions where perfectly clear taht day and route 522 runs along a ridge and at that point has almost a 180 dgree horizan. This location is also in the landing control area of dulles international airport. I later asked a friend of mine who had retired from the airforce as a pentagon empolyee[ what dept?? no clue] he kinda grinned and told me the upper level winds can do some unusual things . I later asked yet another friend that worked at Greenbelt navigation center .
