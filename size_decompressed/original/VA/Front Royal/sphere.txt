I am a very open minded person who intelligently considers various explanations before coming to a conclusion. On multiple occasions from 2013-2014 I personally have witnessed flying crafts and orbs of light that linger, glide closely overhead and abruptly change direction then accelerate and speed off into the distance.  Front Royal, Va, has a lot of airplane activity daily and is not uncommon because there is a small airport in the town.  I KNOW the difference! Especially growing up in Washington, DC, where we have planes flying over almost every 15 mins.   I am currently back in the DC area and have furthermore verified that what I was seeing was not a manmade craft or hoax.  That town is in the Shenandoah valley and fairly secluded.  It definitely needs to be investigated if only for a week or two.  I assure you that a sighting will be made.  The most disturbing sighting was on a cloudy night as I was on my front porch smoking a cigarette.  A dull metallic object caught my eye as I looked up at the sky as I often did to appreciate the view of the stars.  We don't get a great view here in the city so I made a point every night to enjoy the beauty.  As I looked up, as God be my witness no more than 30 ft directly above my head was a cigar shaped metallic craft gliding completely silent over my head then behind my house.   I rushed cigarette still in hand which is odd because there is no smoking allowed in my home to the back deck to find the object nowhere in sight.  I was petrified to say the least.  Usually I would see multiple orbs of light far up in the sky,but this was literally right above me and absolutely NO NOISE. It was enough to keep me awake for nights on end and for me to be writing this message.  I always wondered if they would come, logically we can not be the only ones out there in our universe.  I now have proof because of my own two eyes that we have been visited.   As I said I've since moved back to DC, but that area needs a looking into.
