Strange lights were hovering above the valley,they remained in the same location for over an hour tonight.;2003-03-15 23:30:00;2 hours;Strange lights were hovering above the valley,they remained in the same location for over an hour tonight. The object was blue,green,red,even purple at times,we saw this collage of colors hovering just over the northern shennandoah valley,just 30 minutes ago.It never moved,during the first hour.Then it started moving south west,and is now moving farther away now.Our home sits on the top ridges of Paris mountain,and we have an unobstucted view of the whole valley,we are at 2500 ft.I can now hear military jets flying past us,this is very unusal at this time of the am.The jets are heading in that direction.I guess I'm not the only witness up here.the object just was hovering and flashing,very strange. ((NUFORC Note:  The star, Sirius, would be in the southwestern sky at the time indicated by the witness.  PD));38.9301;-78.1887000000001
I must say I would have thought it was a shooting star if it was not for the speed at which it traveled.;2013-04-12 09:50:00;30 secs;I must say I would have thought it was a &quotshooting star&quot if it was not for the speed at which it traveled. It glided through the sky and &quotslowed&quot its speed for about 3 seconds and then immediately rocketed off into the night sky. I am reporting from Front Royal,Va and moved here about 8 months ago.   Since December of 2012 I personally along with a few neighbors have witnessed numerous sightings of UFO's. I am not sure if this is a &quotHot Spot&quot or the next Nome,but I believe it warrants an investigation. When I say numerous I mean literally upwards of 6 in the last few weeks. These are naked eye sightings NOT to be confused with airplanes because we get a lot of that activity and are more than familiar with airplanes flying overhead. I will most certainly be documenting the next sightings because there will be more I'm sure. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.

Three bright whight ligts flying stright up fallowing each other like rockets;2013-11-03 22:23:00;2 minutes;three bright whight ligts flying stright up fallowing each other like rockets I was sitting in my living room watching to and rocking my little girl to sleep. when i noticed a bright white light outside my window.  At first i thought headlights being as i live close to a road. when i looked to see what it was i notice the light was in the sky.  the i though police helicopter. however when it did not move i realized it was something i had never seem before. then the light got even brighter and (from my point of view) flew straight up like a rocket.  just as the light was almost out of view. i could see small red green and blue lights attached behind the whit light. then another bright white light appeared in about the same spot at the first bright white light. Which proceeded to fly straight up like a firework with small red green and blue lights attached behind the white light. then a third and final bright white light appeared in about the same spot at the first bright white light. and again it flew straight up like a signal flare. with! small red green and blue lights attached behind the white light. i would describe what a saw as the helicopters from the movie Independence day that try to communicate with the aliens. except that that moved much much faster. Also there where about two real helicopters in the sky that looked to be far away from the lights. and flying in a different direction.

Five stationary lights in sky consisting of a series of vertical lights.;2016-06-12 21:00:00;Still there;Five stationary lights in sky consisting of a series of vertical lights. I was walking my dog at around 21:00 and looked up to the sky.  I saw a series of vertical lights stationary in the NE sky.  I watched them for about 10 minutes and they did nor move.  I went to get my wife to show her.  When she came out I saw another set of lights towards the north.  I started ti scan the sky and saw three more of the same configuration of lights. None of them were moving.  They were equally spaced about going from the North to East of where I was standing.   I continued to war has them for about 1/2 hour.  They did not move.   I just looked out and the lights are still there it is 21:46.  I will look tomorrow to see if they are still there. When looking at the moon one of the objects was to the right, the others were to the left.
