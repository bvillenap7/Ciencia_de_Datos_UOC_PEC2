Another co-worker who was walking to her vehicle also saw this object as well. I can only best describe it as a glowing green fire ball shaped object with a tail that trailed behind it.  The object disappeared behind the trees.  It only stayed in my view for no more then ten seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.
