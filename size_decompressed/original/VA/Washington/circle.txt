I got out of bed and looked through the window there was a strange circular object in the sky it had a few lights on it.   This was no airplane I repeat THIS WAS NO AIRPLANE!  The wooshing noise stopped and the aircraft slowed down a little.  It had some haze around it.  The UFO flew directly over our house it was flying right over many trees.  I could not tell what color exactly the object was because it was fairly dark and blended into the backround. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report elects to remain totally anonymous.
