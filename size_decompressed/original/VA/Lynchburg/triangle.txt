Triangular Aircraft Flyby;2002-11-19 04:30:00;10 seconds;Triangular Aircraft Flyby On November 19, 2002 at appromatly 4:30 am est. a coworker and myself stepped outside of our workplace to observe the Leonoids, As we were looking skyward we observed a triangular aircraft traveling in a north to south direction for a period of about 10 seconds. I estimate the craft to be 150 to 100 feet in length, traveling at a speed of 300 to 400 mph at an altitude of 1500 to 2000 feet, and emitted no sound. There were circular, dimly lit, pink-orange lights on each corner of the object. No other light was being emitted from the craft. The object was solid and cast a definitive triangular shape against the night sky, blocking out stars as it passed by. The object appeared to be matte-black in color and had no distinguishable detail other than some contrasting color that was situated in the center of its triangular shape. I will be sending a computer graphic that I made that represents what I saw.;37.3971115789474;-79.1822468421054
Black Triangle, Three White Lights, What was that?;2005-10-06 21:30:00;45 Seconds;Black Triangle, Three White Lights, What was that? At 9:30PM my wife and I were outside loading our car for a trip.   While waiting for her to load some items I noticed a couple of small planes flying overhead at normal altitude and then noticed a large white light moving steadily from east to west at a very low altitude, I would guess under a 1000 feet.  I asked my wife what is was and she could not tell either.  What was alarming to us both was the fact that this thing made no noise and was large, as large as a 747.   It was very dark (new moon) but as the light got closer we both could see the visible outline of a triangle.   The craft rolled at an angle for us both to see one large white light in the front and three white lights in a row at the back.  In the middle was one red light and one green light.  None of the lights blinked.  We were able to view this for approximatey 45 seconds before the trees obstructed our view.   Neither of us beleive in aliens or any sort of thing like that, but what we saw was something we will never forget.

Lights in the sky;2013-04-26 22:00:00;10 minutes;I was outside smoking and I saw three bright reddish orange lights in the sky in a jagged line.  They were very bright at first.  Then two more followed, followed by three more then two more.  I went and got my husband and children to see.  They seemed very bright at first then fading as they traveled very fast across the sky east to northwest.  It was unlike anything I have seen before.;37.3971115789474;-79.1822468421054

I watched it move very slowly to my 10 o'clock by the time the light that i was stopped at changed green, I had to go through the intersection so I lost sight of the craft.  But the whole time I never heared an engine not a sound from it!  When I got home, I told my wife what I saw, and at this time still not sure what I saw, she tells me she saw the same craft and could not hear it, that morning on her way to work. The distance from her sighting and mine was about 30 miles.   Both sighting locations appeared to be off main highways about 25-50 meters into the treeline, if we had to pin point it.   My location was Lynchburg Va and hers was Hurt Va.;37.3971115789474;-79.1822468421054
Orange triangular object flying around Lynchburg;2014-07-04 22:30:00;10 minutes;Orange triangular object flying around Lynchburg While driving home from seeing fireworks we noticed two bright lights hovering to our left one of them then vanished.   After seeing that I starting looking around to see if there was anything else and to the right I saw a large triangular object that was orange.   Since I was driving I was not able to look to closely, but my boyfriend watched it and said it was moving in zig zags almost.  It then went straight up and was gone.   When we got home, another man who lives with us said that he was outside with the dog and that he saw the triangular craft as well.  He that it flew directly over our house and it was making a humming sound.  He also said that the dog didn't seem to like it at all, he bristled up and growled until the object was gone.;37.3971115789474;-79.1822468421054
