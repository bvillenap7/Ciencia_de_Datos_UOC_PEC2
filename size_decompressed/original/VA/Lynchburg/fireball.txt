He told me where it was located but I couldn’t find it, so he came over.  We went in my backyard where there is a huge clearing to look at the sky and UFO through binoculars.  The UFO that he was looking at was to the right of the dipper and to the left of the moon.  So the star was between the two.  I couldn’t tell that it was moving.  But what I did notice was a plane that had took off from the airport and was heading in the direction of the supposed UFO.   And what was unexpected, we weren’t even looking for it a big bright light that was located in the dipper took off in an s shape up.  My brother said the light looked red/orange. It appeared white to me.  It was just a stream of light.  The event only lasted seconds.  Where ever this UFO was I didn’t see it until it was this bright light in the bottom right of the dipper and went in an s shape up to the left corner of the dipper.  I know for sure that this wasn’t an airplane since I live right by the airport I know the difference. This event took place between 8:14 and 8:20pm.;37.3971115789474;-79.1822468421054
Six bright orange fireballs or orbs of light travelling in a formation wsw away from Timberlake VA.;2014-05-24 21:30:00;5 minutes;Six bright orange fireballs or orbs of light travelling in a formation wsw away from Timberlake VA. My wife and I had just dropped off my roommate's girlfriend and when we drove up to the stop sign we both witnessed what appeared at first to be a very, very bright constellation in the sky.    My first initial thought was, wow a constellation - but this only lasted a millisecond because these were no stars for sure.  There were 5-7 objects, bright, round, with a definite orange/red glow to them.  They were obviously very far away from us and I could't guess at their altitude quite honestly.   I want to say the best way to think of these would be to imagine seeing the constellation Orion in the sky, but the stars were bright and orange.  Of course it wasn't this exact shape but there were something like two lights, left to right, then below another two, and then on the bottom of the formation at least two more.   They were headed west, southwest and we were basically at Timberlake (the lake, not the city) Virginia.  I looked at a map and I'd guess the lights would be somewhere close to Smith Mt. Lake or between that and us.   We sat there in the car watching them and I was really flustered and didn't know what to look for.  Had this been a regular occurrence I would have paid more attention to the details.  I can say that there was some movement among the individual objects, but very slight.   We watched them for at least five minutes.  They kind of just faded away one by one and there was a large cloud formation they seemed to get lost behind.   My wife and I drove in the general direction as best as the roads would allow but we never did see them again.  Definitely a very intense few minutes and I only wish I could see them again.   Oh, the color would be exactly what you would expect from a hot air balloon come to think of it, that fiery red/orange flame color.;37.3971115789474;-79.1822468421054
((HOAX??))  Red ball with fire over Lynchburg, Va.  ((anonymous report));2017-03-04 18:42:00;3 minutes;Red ball with fire over Lynchburg, Va. I saw a red ball like object that appeared to have a flame of sorts around it.  It moved upward and proceeded slowly in a horizonal motion then increased slightly in speed.   As i was driving, I was unable to keep a constant visual of the object, and it disappeared.   I have never witnessed anything like this.
