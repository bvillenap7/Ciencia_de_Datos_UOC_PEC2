White cigar shaped object was stationary in the sky and then it was simply no longer there.;2005-09-02 09:40:00;3 minutes;White cigar shaped object was stationary in the sky and then it was simply no longer there. I was driving on route 460 by the city of Lynchburg (by Liberty University) and witnessed a cigar shaped object in a stationary posistion west of the city for about 3 minutes time. The sky was totally clear (blue skies) with visibility at least 30 miles as I could clearly see the Blue Ridge Mountains in the background. The object seemed to be around 10 thousand feet in the air. The object was white but seemed to glimmer a silver color. The sun was low in the sky in the east and the object seemed to be reflecting the sun, much like a mirror does. The object really struck me becuase it was not moving at all, there were no markings, lights, or other things that made the object look like a plane. I lost sight of the object (sky) for about 15 seconds as my car passed a row of trees. After passing the row of trees the object was gone. I have never seen anything like that.;37.3971115789474;-79.1822468421054
maybe sighting of ISS?;2005-09-18 21:00:00;about 15 seconds;maybe sighting of ISS? Sitting in my back yard I observed a cigar shaped light gliding slowly along in the sky.  It was not blinking and was very bright and moving pretty slowly.  There was an airplane (jet) in the sky at the same time and it's light was blinking and was nowhere near the size as this light...that is how I could tell that it was not an aircraft.  I figure maybe it was a sighting of the International Space Station?  Anyway, it disappeared into the clouds but the brightness could still be seen for a few more seconds thru the clouds.  That is how bright it was.  And compared to the plane that was in the sky at the same time it was significantly larger than the plane and definitely a cigar shape...longer than a jet (from grounds-eye)and much, much brighter.;37.3971115789474;-79.1822468421054
