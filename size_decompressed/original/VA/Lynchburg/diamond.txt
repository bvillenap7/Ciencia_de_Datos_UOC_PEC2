update to eariler report (3/23/04);2004-03-23 21:30:00;30+ minutes;update to eariler report (3/23/04) This is an update to my report submitted on 3/23/04.  In the NUFORC note at the bottom of my report it said that I didn't indicate which direction the object was.  It was spotted toward the west.  Also, NUFORC said that my description was not inconsistent with a sighting of Venus.  I thought that also, but what concerned me was that the object was VERY MUCH brighter than I have EVER seen Venus, plus the fact that it just disappeared after about 30 minutes.  Also, the next night, Venus was not in the same position in the sky.  The star or whatever we saw was down lower to the horizon and a little more towards the north than Venus. I'm not saying we saw anything, but it just was a very strange sight, unlike anything I've seen before.;37.3971115789474;-79.1822468421054
VERY bright, diamond shape  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus??  PD));2004-03-23 21:30:00;30 min+;VERY bright, diamond shape My husband and I were leaving my parents house a few miles east of Lynchburg, VA. at about 9:30p.m. tonight.  We noticed a VERY bright light, very close to the back of my parents home, not too high in the air but larger and brighter than any other thing in the sky.  At first, I thought it was just an air plane, but then my husband noticed it as we were backing out of the driveway and asked me if I saw that strange light in the sky.  We then noticed it was a diamond shape with small beams of light shining out of it from both sides.  As we traveled towards our home in Lynchburg, about 14 miles, it got even brighter then we noticed it started to travel away from us as it got dimmer.  I also noticed a small puff of smoke just when it started to move away. We watched it even after we got home for about 5 more minutes as it traveled further away from us.  Then about 10 minutes later we looked out at it again and it was as small as the other stars in the sky but it was very red at that point.  Then about 15 minutes later, it was just gone.  We are not sure what exactly it was, but it was definitely a diamond, very bright, unlike anything either of us has ever seen in the sky before. ((NUFORC Note:  The witness does not indicate the direction they were looking, but her description is not inconsistent with a sighting of Venus, we observe.  PD));37.3971115789474;-79.1822468421054
