Extremely bright white light stationary over the Blue Ridge Mountains to the North of my position.  Object EXTREMELY bright as if Magnesium burning.  Began slow movement Easterly along the mountain skyline.  Lost sight due to building blocking further view. Intensity of light fluctuated consistant with magnesium burning. No pulsations observed with periodic intervals. Intensity so great that it illuminated the skyline of the mountains within a couple degree arc.;37.3971115789474;-79.1822468421054

At first I dismissed it as an airliner since it was close to the typical flight path of passenger jets I often see flying overhead.  What caught my attention however was that I DID see an airliner and at that point I could compare/contrast the two.  The bright orange light had no blinking navigation lights, no spot lights, and was easily traveling 3-4x the speed of the jet â€“ on which the blinking lights were very evident.  There was no evidence that the orange light was aware of the jet or visa-versa.  The light traveled from south to north-east crossing the night sky in about 30 seconds at about a max of 40 degrees elevation.  The color was a very distinct orange that never wavered.  The flight path seemed constant, but the distance away was hard to determine.  There was a faint sound of jet engines but since there was another plane in the sky I could not pinpoint the source. My next thought was that this could be the ISS which I have taken time to spot a few times with my son.  So as soon as the light passed behind the tree I did a quick online check and verified there are no ISS sightings for our location for a few more days.  And since the shuttle flight was canceled yesterday, there was no need to check its flight path. So all that said, I still cannot dismiss it as satellite or even a very high-flying advanced aircraft of some type.  It did remind me greatly of other ISS passings and being about an hour before sunrise, a satellite makes sense.  However, the speed, brightness, and orange hue were unique enough for me to submit a report.;37.3971115789474;-79.1822468421054

We parked on a street behind a grocery store nearby the stadium.   While waiting for the fireworks to begin, my son pointed out an bright orange orb shaped light in the sky. The orb was larger than any star or light on an airplane I've ever seen.  It appeared directly over top of the grocery store and seemed be still and not moving at all.  I couldn't really tell how high up in the sky it was, but it appeared to be no higher than a low flying plane.  It was not flashing or blinking in any way.  It didn't change color or fade in and out, it was just a steady, bright orange colored light.   It began moving very slowly toward us going from south-east to north-west.  It made no sound as it moved.  It also moved very smoothly in a straight line, not changing it's speed or jerking in any way. It moved approximately 200 feet in 3-4 minutes.   While we were watching it, an airplane flew right by it going in a south-eastern direction.  Almost immediately, after the plane passed the object, it turned to the north and seemed to just fade away.  Other than myself and my son, two women, and several children were watching the object, but I didn't get their names.;37.3971115789474;-79.1822468421054
About 10 minutes into the New Year a slow moving orange ball of light was observed with no sound nor was there any flashing lights;2012-01-01 12:10:00;5-7 minutes;About 10 minutes into the New Year a slow moving orange ball of light was observed with no sound nor was there any flashing lights I took my dog out to potty after doing the countdown for New Years with my 2 awake sons and my mother. The time was approximately 12:10 and I seen a bright orange light come out from over the trees. My 1st instinct was fireworks being the New Year was just rung in, but it was a constant orange light. Then I thought it was a flare due to the color??? But the 1 bright orange light  was slowly mo ing in the direction of our house. I had enough time to call my mom and oldest son outside to see, which the light was still traveling, but had steered  in another direction towards the back of the house keeping the same constant bright orange glow, even while moving away from our house. We did not see any flashing lights as on any aircraft nor was there any sound involved. The light continued on until it was lost in the trees. I am a 33 year old mother of 3 boys (my oldest who is 12 is one who also witnessed it along with myself and my mother). No alcohol or drugs involved. Clear night. I have never seen anything like it before in my life!!! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.  PD));37.3971115789474;-79.1822468421054
6-10 Orange lights move slowly and silently across the sky, and then suddenly disappear.;2014-03-01 21:00:00;~5 minutes;6-10 Orange lights move slowly and silently across the sky, and then suddenly disappear. It started off as just one orangeish red light moving slowly across the sky, and then suddenly several others followed in a perfectly formed line.  These lights did not blink or flicker and they were silent, so I know it was not an airplane or anything like that.  As these orange lights moved across the sky,they then just randomly disappeared.  Me and my parents saw about maybe somewhere between 6-10 of them move across the sky, and then randomly just disappear without a trace.  It was very mysterious.

A green and yellow glowing, circular light appeared in the sky falling toward the earth before fading out of sight.;2015-09-09 04:50:00;2 seconds;A green and yellow glowing, circular light appeared in the sky falling toward the earth before fading out of sight. Toward Candler's Mountain this morning around 4:40-5:00-ish, I was driving and on my way to drop my friend off at his work.   On a long stretch of bridge (over the James River), you can see a grand portion of the sky for a few seconds within that few seconds, something somewhat large, extremely bright and colourful caught our attention over the downtown Lynchburg area.   It left a little bit of a trail behind it and it was a green and yellow light plummeting toward the city.   Before we could really stop to watch it it flickered out of existence, or at very least, our sight.;37.3971115789474;-79.1822468421054
Strange star changing colors and moving slightly but remaining in the same part of the sky for 20+ minutes.;2015-10-11 22:00:00;~20 minutes;strange &quotstar&quot changing colors and moving slightly but remaining in the same part of the sky for 20+ minutes While walking my dog at about 10pm I noticed a red star in the NNE sky as I was looking at the beautiful star lit night sky.  As I watched this star I noticed that it was not red, but it was infact just a bright star...then it turned green, then red then back to white.  I thought it could perhaps be an aircraft traveling toward me and that is why it looked like it was stationary but then it moved slightly to the left (about an inch in my view, which could be many miles in the sky) then back to the original position.  I went and got my daughter to come out and look at it and it did the same thing while she was with me....turned red, then green, then clear for a while then moved slightly to the left and this time up then back to the original position still changing colors.  I even got out binoculars and while it still looked like a star I could see the color change easier thru the binoculars than with my naked eye.  Not saying this is a! UFO, but it was definitely something strange....it stayed in the same spot for about 20 minutes (except for the 2 times I saw it move) then I went inside.  I do not know exactly how long it had been there or how long it stayed after we went inside.  There were planes in the area as we live about 15 minutes from the airport but this didn't move like a plane and looked like it was farther away then when the planes fly over.;37.3971115789474;-79.1822468421054
Dimming Objects over Lynchburg;2021-05-20 23:18:00;10-15 seconds;Dimming Objects over Lynchburg Reporting an observed anomaly in the Southwest Sky between the moon and the star Arcturus.  There were two lights which appeared to be bright planets such as Jupiter or Venus stationary about two lunar diameters apart.  They did not move but simply began to dim and then vanished from sight.   I am an amateur astronomer and fairly familiar with the night sky. I knew there were no planets visible from my location at that time, yet these initially appeared to be planets.  The entire event duration was between 10 and 15 seconds. I checked the Heavens-Above website to see if there may have been iridium satellites visible from my location but did not find any.  This remains a mystery to me especially since there was no movement which would preclude most logical explanations.;37.3971115789474;-79.1822468421054
