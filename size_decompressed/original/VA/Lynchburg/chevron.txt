I went outside and looked toward Lynchburg Airport and observed 2 V-22 Ospreys getting ready to land at the airport. I noticed it had become completely silent in our neighborhood but when I let my two dogs outside they became skittish and refused to come out.  I looked toward the north and observed another fairly large chevron shaped craft with multi-colored lights about a mile from the Ospreys.  The planes went from going in to land to going back up and heading toward the craft.  The ospreys where heading north to chase the craft but the object picked up speed and was gone out of sight.  I witnessed this for approximately 10 minutes after this I started to hear the dogs in our neighborhood bark and both my dogs where no longer skittish.  I have spent 13 years in law enforcement and have never seen or witnessed anything like! what I saw.;37.3971115789474;-79.1822468421054
