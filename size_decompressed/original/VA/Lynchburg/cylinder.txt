As I was scanning the sky toward the NW I saw this white cylinder craft moving exactly like the ISS and I was so excited because I've seen hundreds of night ISS sightings but never one in daylight!  It was just hanging there, moving along, very large and white against the blue morning sky.....no sound and no contrails.....so I get in my car and as I'm driving out of the driveway it hit me....that wasn't the ISS because it was moving the opposite direction of the sighting information!  This craft was moving from NE to SW.  I stopped and could still see it floating on away.  I got 2 pictures of it and as I am researching the images online I find a ton of people with pictures of the same thing just seen at different times, in different years.  They are calling it a Tic Tac s! haped craft.  I don't know what it was, but I KNOW it wasn't any type of jet or airplane that I see going over my house on a regular basis.  It wasn't up as high as the big jets that cross over my house but it was higher than the small planes that cross over my house.;37.3971115789474;-79.1822468421054
