TWO DISTINCT ROUND WHITE LIGHTS STANDSTILL IN THE NIGHT SKY, THEN LIGHTS WENT OFF.;2004-11-26 17:30:00;5 minutes;TWO DISTINCT ROUND WHITE LIGHTS STANDSTILL IN THE NIGHT SKY, THEN LIGHTS WENT OFF. While driving with my friend in her car, I looked at the sky, noticed two VERY distinct round lights, they were not pulsating, just two lights, bright white in color... AS we kept driving and getting closer, the two white lights shut off, and the odd thing was:  THEY JUST STOOD STILL IN THE SKY...can an aircraft actually do that?? Not sure, but I felt it was unexplained as to what the two lights were.  Thats my report: ((name and e-address deleted));37.3155;-79.5335
