Three lights moving slowly overhead, no sound;2005-11-02 22:00:00;15 min;Three lights moving slowly overhead, no sound I was watching television and noticed what appeared to be very bright lights (approx. the size and brightness of car headlights) in the sky coming towards my house.   I stepped onto the porch and saw three very bright lights coming from the southeast.  The object appeared to stop then made a sharp left turn.   I could not distinguish any noise from the object.   It continued on a slow westerly track and disappeared into the horizon.  I am a skeptic and would like to think that I observed a military aircraft of some kind but this object made no sound.   The object was at an altitude well below where normal aircraft would fly, as I am not near an airport or military installation.   The object was also close enough that I should have heard some kind of sound.  Please do not publish my name or any identifying info. as this could be damaging to my reputation.;37.3155;-79.5335
Silent, slow moving triangle shaped craft.;2008-08-05 10:15:00;15 seconds;Silent, slow moving triangle shaped craft. While driving home, I witnessed a triangle shaped object moving very slowly across the sky.  It had 4lights, 3bright ones on each tip with a dimmer one in the center.  As it passed over a bright part in the sky I saw that it was clearly a complete triangle and not the shape of any jet that Iâ€™m familiar with, it also moved very slowly across the sky, to slow to be any jet. It was completely silent, and had no jet wash.;37.3155;-79.5335
