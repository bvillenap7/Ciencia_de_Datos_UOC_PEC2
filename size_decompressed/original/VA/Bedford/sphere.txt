It seems strange to me because I have never seen anything like this, it didn’t move nor had sound, but eventually it did move to another spot, but within a 7 minute time frame to another spot that we seen it at, it could have went to another area before we seen it again, it’s odd that it seems like it has a stop and go pattern like it may be looking or waiting for something.;37.3155;-79.5335
