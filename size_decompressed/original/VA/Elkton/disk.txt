Multiple lighted unexplained aircraft hovering above the sky in rapid movements;2010-11-22 18:15:00;4 Minutes;Multiple lighted unexplained aircraft hovering above the sky in rapid movements I was sitting outside of my home at 16:15 on the end of my car port grilling out steaks due to the nice weather. I had just closed the lid of the grill when I turned towards the horizon and lit a cigarette. After watching the sky, I noticed 4 objects hovering above the horizon, 3 being in the shape of an orb while the last object being in the shape of a saucer. They changed into multiple colors, such as red then blue then green and back to white. The shapes went from left to right in rapid movements and then after about 2 minutes shot directly vertical into the sky. They were no longer seen after that point.;38.4039;-78.6308
