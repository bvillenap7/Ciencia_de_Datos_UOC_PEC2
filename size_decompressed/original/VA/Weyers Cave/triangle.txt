Triangle Aircraft With Bright Lights;2012-01-06 18:00:00;About an Hour;Triangle Aircraft With Bright Lights While traveling Southbound 81 from Harrisonburg to Weyers Cave I spotted a bright light and assumed it to be some sort of spotlight on an aircraft. As I continued to watch it formed a triangle with a light at each point.  Later these lights would blink also forming a line at time (around 4 or 5 dots/lights) blinking in intervals of red and white lights.  Pulled over at a gas station off of Weyers Cave exit and watched also mentioning it to other people who saw and did not recognize the aircraft.  It circled around the area (From Weyers cave to Bridgewater, Va area)and did this for around 45 minutes.  Got to my house and eventually saw it in the distance heading over the mountain range towards Charlottesville VA. I am thinking this was some sort of military aircraft, just not one I am familiar with or have seen before. I also tried to take a video with my phone and pictures with my camera on my droid X but my phone displayed an error message reading Files ca! nnot be displayed at this time  By the time I got home (About 8 minutes away from gas station and away from aircraft)  I was able to get into my videos and pictures. Of course I was unable to record anything...sigh.;38.2895;-78.925
