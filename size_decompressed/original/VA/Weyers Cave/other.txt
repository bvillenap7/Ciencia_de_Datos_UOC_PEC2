U-shaped object above trees with white lights,and blue revolving lights on bottom of it (Feb.1999,Va.);1999-02-21 18:00:00;2min.;U-shaped object above trees with white lights,and blue revolving lights on bottom of it (Feb.1999,Va.) On my way home from work in Harrisonburg,Va.traveling south on interstate 81 it was at dusk I noticed an object above the trees.At first I thought it must have been a newly placed cell tower but as I drove closer parallel to this object with bright and different lights on it I new it wasn't a tower afterall.It was on my right and since I was driving at 65mph I couldn't observe it very long but here is my best description The object was U-shaped with two white lights on each top of the U( The shape is vertical in the sky).It is wide at the bottom of the U with a row of blue revolving lights there. I had power windows and rolled the passenger side down to see better and there wasn't any sound or movement at all it was just stationary up above the treeline.I have always been a skeptic untill that evening.I haven't heard of any other UFO's with this shape,if I were to guess it's size it would have appeared to be larger than a helecopter and similar in shape to a cell tower without a support platform under.Every time we travel through that spot we call it UFO hill.

Man shaped, silent, rotating, black, and hovered ~100 feet about the ground and slightly curved in its path.;2019-06-15 20:34:00;90 seconds;Man shaped, silent, rotating, black, and hovered ~100 feet about the ground and slightly curved in its path. We saw this thing completely black in shape looked just like a person rotating 100 feet in the sky no noise nothing we saw it go about a mile and it never returned so doubt it was a drone and it looked nothing like a drone and behaved nothing like a drone.  We all have pondered or the possibility of what this ufo could possibly be but we are clueless.;38.2895;-78.925
