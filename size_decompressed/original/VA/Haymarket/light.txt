Orange lights over Haymarket Virginia at9:30pm on 11/30/13.;2013-11-30 21:30:00;2 minutes;Orange lights over Haymarket Virginia at9:30pm on 11/30/13. My wife and I are both clinical psychologists.   We  saw approximately 7-10 orange lights in the sky over Haymarket, VA.  3 of them were in a cluster while one light moved quickly ahead of them.  There were more following in a line formation.   I got out of my car and was approached by a police officer in his patrol car who also saw the orange lights.   The lights hovered for about 3 minutes and then quickly moved east and disappeared out of sight within a couple of seconds.  The time was 9:30pm on 11/30/13, and there is no airport in this area.;38.8672;-77.6488
