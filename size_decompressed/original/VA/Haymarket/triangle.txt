I saw some lights following me, like an airplane or helicopter. I was only traveling about 35 mph because of the deer on the rural roads in the area.  The lights followed me for about a mile. Then they got closer. I slowed down. It slowed down. I rolled down the window and looked and could see triangular shaped object closely following me. When I slowed almost to a stop it was right overhead...about 100 feet overhead. Silent. Greenish white lights at the corners of an equilateral triangle. Maybe 100 feet each leg of the triangle. I stopped my truck. It stopped directly overhead. I grabbed my .223 Ruger Ranch rifle from behind the seats and slammed in a magazine and started shooting. After I had shot maybe the first 2-3 rounds the lights went out on the triangle and it just disappeared. I shot 7 rounds more. They were all aimed at where the triangle was or had been. I shot for maybe 10 seconds. Then I took off at about 60 mph for home. When I arrived home I looked up UFO via the Google search engine. I had a girlfriend who thought she was abducted by aliens while driving alone in rural Nebraska in the late 50's when she was about 21. She was always afraid of driving alone in the country. I carry the Ranch Rifle because there are now coyotes near my farm and I raise chickens. I shot at the triangle becasuse I did not want to become an alien science project. At Noon on March 12th I returned to the place where I fired at the triangle and found 10 empty cartriges. No evidence I had hit anything. Just trees and fields. Nearest home is about 2/3 mile away. No electrical problems with my truck since. ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS)) Following up...I drove to the spot where I shot at the triangle during daylight and there was no indication that I had hit it. The spent .223 cartridges were scattered on both shoulders of the road. No homes in the area, just fields and woods. I carry a Ruger Ranch Rifle because there are now coyotes in the area and I have chickens on my small farm. I was about 4 miles from my home when I saw the triangle at 10 PM. A former girlfriend thought she was abducted by a UFO and she was scared to death of being alone in the country.

We doubt that the firearm would have an effect on a UFO, and the consequences of initiating hostilities could be unwelcome.  PD));38.8672;-77.6488
