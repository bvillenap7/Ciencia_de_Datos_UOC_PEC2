Bright light in the sky continually changing shape with red and blue alternating flashes.  ((NUFORC Note:  Star or planet?  PD));2015-04-18 09:00:00;5 hours;Bright light in the sky continually changing shape with red and blue alternating flashes. About three weeks ago my uncle saw a light in the sky that was very bright but off in the distance.   My father, mother, boyfriend, and daughter all came out and witnessed this event.  The object remained at the same altitude and location in the sky for several hours and this leads me to believe that it was not a planet or a star or it would have moved with the earthâ€™s rotation.  It was an object that changed shape and appeared to have blinking blue and red lights.   We all looked at this object first with binoculars then with a telescope and it was constantly changing shapes.  After a while this object began to make erratic movements with G forces that no human could endure.   My uncle who watched this object for several hours noted that at one point he witnessed a beam of light emitted from this object that lasted only a couple of seconds. This has occurred every night for several weeks now.  On one occasion there were three of these objects in the sky for sev! eral hours.  I have searched to see if anyone else has reported this however nothing resembling this observation has surfaced.   Not sure what this object is but would like to know if anyone else has witnessed this strange phenomena.;38.8672;-77.6488
