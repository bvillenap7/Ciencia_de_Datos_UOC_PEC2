Multiple colors blinking.  4 witnesses total.  No sound. Three small circle crafts flying close but then quickly separating.  They were traveling at a pretty high altitude.  One went straight up, one went far left.  The lights were blinking in a line around the circle, blue, red, green.  They would come close together and then dart off again.  Two vaninshed and one was left.  After about 1-2 minutes, the last one also vanished.  They were silent.;37.712;-77.8288
