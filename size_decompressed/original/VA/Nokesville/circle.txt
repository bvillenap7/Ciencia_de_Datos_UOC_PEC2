I was outside waiting for the NASA rocket to be sent off.  They said at 6:00pm, and that is when I was out.  At exactly 6, something caught my attention from the corner of my eye.  I than looked and there was this disc like object just sitting there.  It had many lights on it and the lights were very visible, and so was the craft.  I tried to pull my phone out to record but there was than a bright light and a loud roar.  I looked back up and it was gone.  Than I got a text from NASA that there was some sort of 'delay'.  That sounded very weird to me that there was this weird object at the original time.;38.7006;-77.5475
