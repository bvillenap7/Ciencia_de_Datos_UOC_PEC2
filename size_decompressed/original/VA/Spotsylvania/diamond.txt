At the light in front of chick fa le turning right onto route three it was first going the same direction as us.  And then quickly reversed and started going along right beside our car about normal building height.  It turned sideways and the lights started changing to yellow and it starting racing downwards scaring us half to death because it was so close we thought it was going to crash into our car.   We sped up and it attentively returned to normal direction. It follwed us unrolled we parked. Yet it stayed in the sky all night but moving upwards until it looked as small as a star.  The next day when the story wa! s told to our parents they said they had seen the same thing flying around the house at ten pm last night.;38.1775285714286;-77.6727857142857
