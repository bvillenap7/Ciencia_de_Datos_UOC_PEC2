White then orange orb gained a tail of light when chased off by a heli.;2014-12-12 00:00:00;1 minute;White then orange orb gained a tail of light when chased off by a heli. We were driving home when we saw an orb of light hovering over the north eastern sky that looked like the moon behind the clouds.  While this is happening, the radio gets real staticy (older radio so wouldbt put my money on that one).  We looked again after a break in the trees and we see a heli flying to it and the object flew away straight out of the atmosphere leaving a trail like a comet behind it the heli then hovered where we sighted it for over two hours but the strange orb of light never returned. It was an whitish color at first but then as it sped off fleeing the heli, it was a vibrant orange.  We thought it was a comet because of the tail on it, but then both agreed it had no tail but a minute ago while it was stationary.  And it had this strange aura to it like the moon has thats why we first thought it was the moon.  It was almost like exactly what has been depicted as a warp drive with the streatching trail of light.   Crazy :) and I wouldnt even say it chased the ufo, the ufo left it in tge dust...like the heli didnt even gain on it the ufo was just gone!;38.1775285714286;-77.6727857142857
