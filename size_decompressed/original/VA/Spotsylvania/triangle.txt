Triangular shaped object floating above Rt. 3 was seen and followed for serveral minutes.;2002-12-16 20:30:00;30 mins;Triangular shaped object floating above Rt. 3 was seen and followed for serveral minutes. While on our way to workout my brother and I noticed a strange grouping of lights in the sky floating above Rt. 3.  The lights slowly began to move.  We decided to follow the lights.  As the craft passed in front of the clouds it was breifly backlight revealing a triangular shape with red and green lights at different points on the craft.  The object then disappeared over the treeline and we decided to go workout.  A half hour later while coming back down Rt. 3 on the West lane we noticed the craft still in the air above us only now coming our direction.  We began to follow it until we lost sight of it for good.  Several days later on Christmas day my other brother and I we outside talking at around 9:00 pm when I noticed the same craft in the sky near our house.  He tried to dismiss it as a helicopter but it was making no sound.  I then began to drive down the road and lost site of the craft.  About 15 minutes down the road the craft appeared on the opposite side of the sky now with several other lights around it.  I lost sight of it shortly after that.;38.1775285714286;-77.6727857142857
