I was driving west on a clear day when I suddenly saw a bright, green ball of light fly at high speed across the sky from I believe North to South, then disappear.;38.1775285714286;-77.6727857142857
strange lights moving(communicating?) rapidly;2008-10-26 21:00:00;At least a hour;strange lights moving(communicating?) rapidly I was taking our dog outside when I looked up in the sky, something I do every time I take her out, only to see a single, rapidly flashing light to the north. It stayed still momentarily, but then rapidly moved in all directions. I went inside and got my parents, and my little brother came outside, too. We then noticed that there were 2 more objects, all 3 forming a triangle. My Mom and I have seen a large triangle fly over us before(did not know about this, it was about 3 months ago), so we thought it was that. But, the 3 objects were moving in turns, meaning they were taking turns, almost as if they were communicating. It was not our eyes, because my dad brought out a pair of binoculars and they were moving while stars behind them were not. The objects were moving very oddly, going west and instantly stopping and going east. Therefore, it was not a airplane or helicopter. No meteor has ever moved like that. And, if there was a human piloting it(top secret aircraft), they could not handle the g's of the weird movements. We also saw some blue and red beams shoot out of the main one(brightest one) and disappear within half a second (there were about 10 beams, 7 blue, 3 red);38.1775285714286;-77.6727857142857
