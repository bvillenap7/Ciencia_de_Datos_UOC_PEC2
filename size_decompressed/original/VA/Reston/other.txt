PD));2016-06-30 23:00:00;30 seconds;I was walking with my two dogs as I do every night, I saw in the sky what seemed to be a star, I happened to actually catch this one on video from my cell phone camera.   On this particular sighting, I only caught 1 on camera, it just appears from the black sky and looks like a star, but then it begins to move in zig zag random motions.  I have it on video. My cell phone held by my hand.   I walk with my two dogs on a daily/nightly basis, I am a fan of looking at the sky and I happened to actually be able to catch this particular sigthing.  I have had some in the past and not to this exact description, but this is the only one I have managed to capture on video.
