Red/orange, round, glowing object moving slowly and southeast at 1:45AM on 12/05/12.;2012-12-05 01:45:00;30 seconds;Red/orange, round, glowing object moving slowly and southeast at 1:45AM on 12/05/12. OBJECT: The object was mostly spherical. It seemed to change shape but mostly because the light was bright and the edges of the object appeared to blur slightly.  While it wasn't a fireball it's colors were reddish orange and was extremely bright.  It seemed to be moving slowly and southeast in direction.  Its path never changed direction as it flew directly over my building. I followed it until it flew out of view over trees and other buildings.  While not moving very fast it was in and out of view quickly.  Living in the DC area I am privy to jet fighter flyovers, search helicopters and and a host of commercial aircraft.  This was not the shape, color, size, speed, or sound of any aircraft I have ever seen.  OBSERVER: I am a 42 year male. I work as an art director for a large technology firm and I teach graphic and web design for a prominent college university. I have lived in the DC area all my life.;38.9577001788906;-77.3472699463329
