Several white lights darted and zoomed in random patterns across a small area of sky.;2013-06-29 23:00:00;10 minutes;Several white lights darted and zoomed in random patterns across a small area of sky. There were at least half a dozen white lights darting around in a small area of the night sky.   At times, they all moved toward each other, at other times seemed to be following each other from right to left and back around.  They disappeared behind clouds and re-emerged on the other side of the cloud.  As a group, they slowly headed west, until we could no longer see them. 4 of us from two different households saw the lights.

Strange amber lights, streaming from the east, making now sound and disappearing.;2016-03-11 21:30:00;5-10 minutes;Strange amber lights, streaming from the east, making now sound and disappearing. Last night, at about 9:30, as I was watching TV, I noticed out my sliding glass door (which faces woods) bright amber lights coming up out of the east.  I watched at least 15 to 20 of them come one right after the other.   They made ZERO sound and disappeared right before my eyes, as they hit a certain point in the sky.   I'm not a believer in UFO's but this freaked me out.;38.9577001788906;-77.3472699463329
