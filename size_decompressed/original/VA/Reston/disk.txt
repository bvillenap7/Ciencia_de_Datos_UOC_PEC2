Disc-shaped Object Motionless in Daytime Sky Over Reston, VA on June 7, 2014 at 1:41 PM;2014-06-07 13:41:00;10 minutes maybe;Disc-shaped Object Motionless in Daytime Sky Over Reston, VA on June 7, 2014 at 1:41 PM This was years ago, but I have just decided to file a report, along with a photo I had taken. I was a 15-year-old student at South Lakes High School when, on June 7, 2014 at 1:41 PM, I was getting ready to step on the field for soccer practice and noticed an object in the sky. It was a disc-shaped object and largely white and grey. It never moved for as long as I observed it, which was probably about 5 minutes, until I had to attend practice. When I looked back maybe 10 minutes later, it was gone. From the standpoint of the photo, I was standing on the main field, looking through the field goal uprights in the NNE direction towards Langston Hughes Middle School.;38.9577001788906;-77.3472699463329
