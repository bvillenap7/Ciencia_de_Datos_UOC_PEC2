PD));2012-03-20 23:00:00;on going;Large blinking object with sparks of red, blue, green and orange around the edges. There is currently an object in the southwest sky. I have been observing the object with binoculars it is amazing and beautiful red, blue, green and orange sparks are flaring out.  I noticed it with the naked eye it is much larger than the other stars but is stationary and blinking.  I wish I had a picture so I could share it with the world.
