They would go diagonal into the sky and disappear.  They seemed to follow a straight line. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

I was reading a book next to my bedroom window when I saw 3 triangular crafts with red, orange and blue lights appear out of nowhere.  I watched them slowly they just sat there.   I got up to get my Phone then it lagged and they shot out of the sky.  I was perplexed.;38.4587360294118;-77.448005882353
Large triangle shaped craft in Virginia;2018-08-01 02:30:00;15-20 seconds;Large triangle shaped craft in Virginia To whom this may concern,  About a year and a half ago at 2:30am I woke up and heard helicopters.  I looked out my window and saw a huge triangle shaped craft about the size of a 747, with only one light on the front it was slowly moving across the sky very low.  I soon realized the noise was not coming from the object but the 2 choppers following it.  I live very close to the Quantico Marine Base in Virginia . It only lasted about 15-20 seconds.  My wife would not wake up so she never saw it.  I told her about it the next morning.  Iâ€™m only disclosing this in case maybe someone else might have reported it.  It could help corroborate another sighting.  What I saw was amazing and NOT normal. Best regards, ((name deleted));38.4587360294118;-77.448005882353
