The object left a purplish pink haze or flame right behind it, but no smoke like it was exhaust like from a rocket.  It disappered after about 30 seconds into thin air, like a hole in space.   Then about a minute later we saw a very bright pink light behind some large trees and behind where the object vanished.   Iâ€™m not sure if my neighbors saw it but they were outside when it happened. There was only one and it flew straight in the air. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));38.4587360294118;-77.448005882353
