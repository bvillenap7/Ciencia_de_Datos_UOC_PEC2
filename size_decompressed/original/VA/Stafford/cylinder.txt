Strange sighting in Stafford, Va.;2008-01-31 05:40:00;5 mins;Strange sighting in Stafford, Va. Opened my front door, and to my surprise, hovering just above the trees I saw something that was very wide, 2 lights in the middle, and one light on each end of the wings. Large lights. NO SOUND AT ALL. I closed the door, and had my daughter come to the door and check to make sure that I wan't a nut, and she saw the same thing. Very scary. We closed the door and went back to the patio door, just in time to see this object leaving. Very wide, and one large light in the back middle portion of this thing. Still heard no noise. This thing was just above the top of the trees, so it was very close. Was low enough to shine the lights into house.;38.4587360294118;-77.448005882353
