Zipping White Light.;2003-12-05 11:00:00;5 minutes;Zipping White Light. I was looking out my window at the sky and saw this weird white light zipping across the sky moving fast and changing directions.  It was very small but definitely noticeable.  My grandfather was with me at the time and I pointed it out to him in which he also saw it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Appear like full moon like light not where moon is and photos make it look like rows of lights can't see it that well;2012-07-08 00:00:00;hours;Appear like full moon like light not where moon is and photos make it look like rows of lights can't see it that well. I have seen on numerous occasions what might be classified as a UFO, but since I live near Quantico, I think maybe it is a govt thing.  It appears to naked eye like full moon but it moves quickly to side at tops of tree hovering possibly and disappears.  First started noticing around 1997.  Last year decided to see if I could photograph and the pictures with my camera came out nothing like what I was seeing with the naked eye.  I was thinking about the WW2 Foo Fighters developed to throw enemy off.  So when you look at this need to figure out what it is but to naked eye appears like a round full moon.  See attached photos from late at night EST NW sky at my address.  Last time it was in another location above trees reason knew it was not moon is because moon will not be there that time and it moved in a way that defied logic.

Bright white light, moved in straight line from south to north, just disappeared. Stafford, VA;2012-09-06 21:20:00;1-2 minutes;Bright white light, moved in straight line fm south to north, just disappeared. Stafford, VA I was in my backyard, looking up at the sky when I saw a bright light pretty much directly overhead, heading from south to north.  Before I realized it was moving, I thought it was a bright star. It moved at a medium speed in a fairly straight line for about a minute, then it just winked out.  I waited, but did not see it re-appear.;38.4587360294118;-77.448005882353
