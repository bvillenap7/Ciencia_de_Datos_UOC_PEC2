On November 17, 2012, at approximately 6:30 p.m. my husband was outside and called to me to come quickly. I ran outside, and we saw a swarm of bright-colored objects floating noiselessly very low to the ground.  We live in Stafford, Virginia, near the Quantico Marine Corps Base, so we thought at first that it might be a group of helicopters, but there was no noise at all. We estimate there were more than 10 and less than 20 of these floating objects. They had bright red and white lights and moved quickly from northeast to southwest.  I could not get a good sense of whether they were sphere-like or boomerang in shape, but they seemed to cluster together and move effortlessly.  Some appeared to hover and loop back, while others kept floating at a quick pace across the sky above power line level. I have never before seen anything like this nor have I reported any such incident. As quickly as they crossed the sky, they seemed to vanish.;38.4587360294118;-77.448005882353
