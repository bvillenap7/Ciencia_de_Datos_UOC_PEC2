I SAW A LARGE DARK RECTANGULAR OBJECT IN THE SKY.;1997-07-07 14:30:00;2:00 minutes;I SAW A LARGE DARK RECTANGULAR OBJECT IN THE SKY. IT WAS A SUNNY CLOUDLESS DAY ABOUT 2:30 p.m. I WAS TAKING A SHORTCUT BEHIND A LOCAL SHOPPING CENTER NEAR QUANTICO, VA.  I NOTICED 2 MILITARY HELICOPTERS HOVERING SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE INTERSECTION OF RT. 610 AND ONVILLE RD.  ONE OF THE HELICOPTERS WAS SOMEWHAT HIGHER THAN THE OTHER AND OFF TO THE LEFT.   ABOVE THEM WAS A VERY LARGE DARK RECTANGULAR OBJECT.   I LOST SIGHT OF THE OBJECT AS I WAS PASSING A SMALL STAND OF TREES.  WHEN I PASSED THE TREES I LOOKED UP AND THE OBJECT WAS GONE.  THE HELICOPTERS WHERE STILL THERE.  I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT WAS.  LIVING NEAR QUANTICO I THOUGHT I HAD SEEN EVERY AIRCRAFT THERE IS.  THIS WAS NOTHING I HAD EVER SEEN.

On Halloween night 2003, the night was clear when a huge retangular object flew directly over my house.;2003-10-31 18:30:00;2-3 seconds;On Halloween night 2003, the night was clear when a huge retangular object flew directly over my house. It was Halloween night, October 31, 2003, in Stafford, VA.  I was listening to the news this evening and heard the International Space Station was to be orbiting over the area and was to be visible.   Around 1800 hours, I was getting my kids ready for Trick or Treating in the neighborhood.  They left around 1810 hours with my wife while I got the bucket filled with candy.  I was outside setting up for 2 reasons:  1.	  So I was comfortable while giving out candy to all the kids.  2.	  To see if I could get a glimpse of the International Space Station. At close to 1830 hours, I saw my neighbor across the street on his deck and then immediately a huge rectangular, metallic looking object flew directly over mine and my neighbor’s house.   We looked at each other and I yelled to him that it was the International Space Station.  I also said, that I was overwhelmed that they would actually fly the station this close to earth, because it appeared to fly so much lower than what an airplane flies. I quickly went about the night and was telling everyone I saw the International Space Station.  Another neighbor when he and his kids came by was excited to hear what I saw.  He asked me to come over to his house the next night because he knew the Station would again be flying over the area the following night. When I went over to his house the following night, he had his Telescope set up in his back yard.  I kidding around with him, telling him he didn’t need the Telescope because what I saw flew so low, it was clearly visible.  He explained that the Station while flying over you still needed either a Telescope or Binoculars to see it.  I then kept my mouth shut and when the station did fly over, what I saw through the telescope, it was clearly what I did not see the night before. What I saw Halloween night was rectangular and appeared to be about 50 yards in length.   It was metallic, made absolutely no noise, and it flew off so quickly that at the time my mind could not comprehend.  More specifically, at the moment it passed over, I cognitively thought I was seeing the International Space Station, and with it in space I knew its orbit would pass quickly and what I did not calculate in my mind was the close proximity it was overhead. The UFO that I saw was not smooth and had its metal fabric skinned over every fitting it precisely.  What I’m saying is the skin had nooks and crevices.  There were no lights but appeared to have been laminated from the reflective lights of our neighborhood.  I only had 2 seconds to see and comprehend what I saw, because has fast, as it appeared it too had disappeared.;38.4587360294118;-77.448005882353
I was looking to see the International Space Station on Halloween night when a craft flew directly over my home.;2013-10-31 19:00:00;Seconds;I was looking to see the International Space Station on Halloween night when a craft flew directly over my home. It was Halloween night and on the news that evening, the weatherman reported the International Space station would be visible.  So between groups of children where I was handling out candy I’d be looking up in the night sky just to see if I could see it.  At approximately 19:00 hours while looking up directly flying over my house in a westerly direction I could only see the bottom of this craft.  It appeared to be approximately 40 yards long with the bottom being metallic, but not being smooth.  The bottom of this craft looked molded to circumvent or to go around internal equipment. The craft shot off continuing West faster then ANYTHING I have ever seen.  My neighbor across the street was on his deck cleaning up and asked what that was. Initially I was excited because I actually thought I’d seen the International Space Station.  The following day I was speaking to another neighbor who is in the FBI and a huge Amateur Astronomer.  I told him I saw the Space station! and he stated how?  He set up his telescope that night and I again said he would not need the telescope because I saw clearly with my eyes.  He set it up anyway and when he located the Space Station via the telescope I explained that that was not what I saw. I’ve told my family and close friends about in passing conversations but it has just become a moment in my life I’ll never forget.;38.4587360294118;-77.448005882353
