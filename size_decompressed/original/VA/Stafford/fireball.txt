They did not streak across the sky, but merely floated. It seemed there were 3 or four formations with 3 or 4 fireballs each.  This event was witnessed by me and my wife as we were driving in Aquia Harbour at about 6:30 p.m., as were heading to the local movie theater to see the movie Lincoln.  I have seen others report this incident and was glad to see that my wife and I were not the only ones to witness this event.;38.4587360294118;-77.448005882353
