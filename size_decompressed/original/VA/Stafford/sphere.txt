extremely large object hovering over the tree tops, then vanished w/o a trace;2008-04-22 21:00:00;15 mins;extremely large object hovering over the tree tops, then vanished w/o a trace As I pulled up to my house on Tuesday April 22, 2008 (around 9pm), I heard a very loud noise, such as a helicopter hovering right over my head. When I looked up, I saw no helicopter but  an extremely  large spherical object  surrounded by very dim lights right over the tree tops.  I stood looking up at the sky for about 10 minutes while the object just hovered in the same spot. Then when I was walking inside to get everyone outside, it just vanished, instantly. Living right by Quantico for a long time, I know that this was no normal aircraft, not with the size and shape of the one that was hovering that night.
