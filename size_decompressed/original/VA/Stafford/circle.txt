Circular glowing objects flying in the sky.;2012-11-17 18:30:00;3-5 minutes;circular glowing objects flying in the sky While dri1vng with my boyfriend on Saturday 17 November at approximately 6:30 we saw about 10 bright orange lights in the sky.  They started out just above the tree line continuing up directly above.  They seemed to be square and in a geometric pattern. After pulling over in a parking lot we noticed that they seemed to be moving slowly moving all at the same speed, they were not blinking and remained the entire duration (about 3-5min) of the citing and they made no sound.  Some clumped together and they one by one disappeared.  There were no clouds in the sky and after contacting the federal aviation agency there was clarity of 10 miles.  They were moving from north west to south west and the wind was moving in the opposite direction.;38.4587360294118;-77.448005882353
Luminous Bright Orange Lightballs Traveling in a Pattern in Stafford VA;2012-11-17 18:33:00;3 minutes;Luminous Bright Orange Lightballs Traveling in a Pattern in Stafford VA Taking place in Stafford, VA from approximately 6:33 P.M until 6:36 P.M, there were roughly eight to ten very bright luminous orange balls of light in the sky.  Traveling at a constant and steady speed, many of them broke off into groups and continued to travel in separate directions until just disappearing without a trace.  For a brief moment, they appeared stationary but as they became more visible it was obvious that they were traveling at a considerable speed.  Way faster than a helicopter, but it made absolutely no sound.  It was clearly in sight and would have made sound if it were a familiar object but remained silent and clearly visible until disappearing one by one.  Some appeared to be very close to each other, almost touching but moved uniformly and at a steady speed.  Appearing in different groups and formation, the bright orange lights stretched across the sky traveling some in the same direction and some in different directions all traveling from the Northeast.  All of them gradually disappeared heading Southwest checked the local weather immediately after and visibility was 10 miles 46 degrees wind northeast 4 mph (groundlevel). ((NUFORC Note:  The witness also called our Hotline, and added that the lights were not blinking.  PD));38.4587360294118;-77.448005882353
Large, white, unmoving object above tree line.;2015-10-08 21:30:00;60 seconds;Large, white, unmoving object above tree line. Noticed a large, solid, white light above the tree line larger than a star and obviously a solid light.  No red or green wing lights to indicate aircraft.  Object stayed in place, was not moving.   I called my husband to observe and confirm aircraft (he's a pilot, said it was not any aircraft he's ever seen) as we watched, it disappeared and did not return.   The whole scenario lasted approximately 60 seconds from start to finish and I have been scrolling the news to see if there was any explanation for the occurrence.  Have never seen anything like it and I will probably not be stargazing again for a while.  Lol;38.4587360294118;-77.448005882353

The Stars were out.  But I noticed something strange. There were lights in the sky, all aligned in the shape of a circle.  I noticed this above a tree and I was studying these strange lights.   Then I knew for sure they weren't stars either because I realized they were moving.  Very slow and quietly, and all of a sudden it disappears into the sky.;38.4587360294118;-77.448005882353
Very bright light with small light circling around it.;2016-03-28 19:49:00;5 minutes;Very bright light with small light circling around it. A very bright light that started to blink then got dimmer and then eventually faded out.  Meanwhile another light had circled around it and disappeared before the larger brighter light.;38.4587360294118;-77.448005882353
