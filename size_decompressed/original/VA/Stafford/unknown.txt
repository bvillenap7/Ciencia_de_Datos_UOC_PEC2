Possible rocket launched from eastern shore of Chesapeke Bay. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Wallops Island, VA.  PD));2006-12-16 07:00:00;five minutes;Possible rocket launched from eastern shore of Maryland/Virginia (Chesapeke Bay) certainly not extraterrestrial, but odd.  Trajectory almost precisely (apparently) east-west.  Similar in behavior and speed to commercial airliner, but with only one contrail while flying, but odd for its time of day, apparent altitude (seemingly lower than trans-atlantic jet airliner), and flight corridor - no airplanes have ever been seen flying at that altitude, and certainly no trans-atlantic commercial jets.  After returned (20 seconds away) from getting my camera, the contrails (which had been straight) were wavy due to wind (no doubt), but the odd thing is that the UFO was still shining bright - probably reflection of the sun - sun was rising, but hadn't yet risen, but was apparently stationary.  It faded over the next minute.  I have a couple of photos of this. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Wallops Island, VA.  PD));38.4587360294118;-77.448005882353
Fast moving object flies over my house and vibrates it b4 shooting up in the sky.;2013-11-13 18:40:00;Ongoing;Fast moving object flies over my house and vibrates it b4 shooting up in the sky I was cooking dinner which something flew over my house so low and shook house.. Ran to look out my deck door when I witness something taking off and flying straight up in the sky. It got to a certain point and just stopped and stayed there..  There was noticeable blue & white lights coming from the object.  After some time I saw a helicopter circling the sky then take off and leave.  When the helicopter came the object flew further up in the sky.  After some time it can back down some. Event started around 640 and is still ongoing . Object has been stationary for like 2 and a half hours.;38.4587360294118;-77.448005882353
