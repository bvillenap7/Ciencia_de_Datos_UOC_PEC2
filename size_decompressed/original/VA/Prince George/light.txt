An object that resembles a star that slowly gets brighter, moves slowly, and then speeds up, fades. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS?  PD));2011-05-04 22:10:00;3 minutes;An object that resembles a star that slowly gets brighter, moves slowly, and then speeds up and fades back out. This is the third time in a year I have seen this.  I looked up among the stars and one of them caught my eye because it slowly started getting brighter.  Then I noticed it was moving slowly.  It got as bright as the brightest star in the sky and then slowly started dimming back down.  I noticed the movement was not consistent in direction or speed.  It seemed to slow down and speed up slightly, and it seemed to drift as if not on a straight course.  It got very dim and then eventually faded out of sight.  At times I have thought that maybe it is a satellite or the ISS that is casting an inconsistent reflection from the sun due to its angle, but that is just me speculating.  I see planes in the sky at night often, but their running lights are very easy to spot, and their speed and direction are consistent, unlike this object.  This is also the first time I've ever made this kind of report. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
