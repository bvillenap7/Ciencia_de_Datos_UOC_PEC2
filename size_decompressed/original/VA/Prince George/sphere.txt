Two large, animated, glowing lights Prince George;2003-06-29 23:00:00;Approx. 2 min.;Two large, animated, glowing lights Prince George Two large glowing white sphere shaped lights with a light orange resonance were noticed over an area close to the James River in Prince George Virginia.  The lights were about a quarter of the size of the moon and appeared to be 1.5 miles away from us (witnesses).  I estimate they were .5 mi. above ground level.  The two objects first hovered stationary for over a minute and seemed to move independently of each other.  They then spiraled upwards around each other, then floated back down to a similar altitude as before.  They rested in this position for approx. 5 seconds then shot straight up out of sight.  No noise was recognized as being related to the objects.  I believe them to be two separate objects because when spiraling around each other nothing blocked the light produced by the other.
