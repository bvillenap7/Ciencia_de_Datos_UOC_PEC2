The object was a pulsating sphere that turn a brilliant bright whitish color. The object was moving at a high rate of speed, as the object got brighter it suddenly disappeared. There were no cloud cover, totally clear sky.  The report above was submitted by an anonymous source from Woodbridge,VA on 7/22/13. Tonight, I was riding up Rt. 1 in Dumfries with a friend and we saw this exact sight. We were traveling on a section of the road that goes from Southwest to Northeast and the object appeared high in the sky directly in front of us.  The glowing sphere/fireball appeared to have red lights behind (above since it was diving)the main body of the craft and it appeared to be falling toward Earth.  Then, just before it reached the horizon it disappeared.  There was no noise from this event, and no impact as far as I know.;38.57032;-77.2960320000001
