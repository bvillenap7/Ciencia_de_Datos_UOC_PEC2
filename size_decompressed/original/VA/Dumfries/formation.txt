Several Objects spotted flying over Dumfries, VA, March 09, 2013;2013-03-09 18:00:00;1 hour;Several Objects spotted flying over Dumfries, VA, March 09, 2013 I spotted multiple objects in the sky between 18:00 and 19:00 over Potomac River, Dumfries and Woodbridge in Virgina March 9th. The objects were flying northbound from the southeast. The objects were approximately 20+ thousand feet. I am a private pilot and I used commercial aircraft flying above as a reference.  Aircrafts usually flies between 35 â€“ 40K feet. I also spotted several flocks of seagulls flying.  I used them as reference as a determining factor that the objects where not birds or planes. My only guess was the seagulls were using current winds aloft to glide. I later debunked that theory after researching. I did take several pictures, unfortunately only one came out. I would like somewhere to analyze the photograph and to make more conclusive to what that was inthe sky. I will keep looking and report more sightings. Thanks,;38.57032;-77.2960320000001
