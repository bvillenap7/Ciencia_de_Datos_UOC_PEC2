I lived in a subdivision that was not fully developed and no street light. A friend and I were out walking through the subdivision at night around 9pm in the middle of the summer. We were walking on a desert section of road and a strange shaped craft flew over us maybe about 300 hundred feet above us, it looked like a plane at first but no lights expect on head light shining straight in front of it. It was flyingnot straight but sideways. It had a large wing span but a short body, didn't know which end was which expect for the direction on travel and head light. It suddely came right over us and it's light turn down on us. It made no noise at all and it's light was so bright you could see dust particles floating around in the beam. It stayed over head  about a minute or so, enough time for me to fall in a ditch and get up a run, and then it went dark and took off like a bullet. We ran off back to my house and I sprained my wrist when I fell. The part I will remember was the bright light that spot lighted us and the complete silence when it came over head, all of the night bugs went quiet and I could only hear me and my friend breathing. I was 15 years old then.;37.5182;-77.1515
