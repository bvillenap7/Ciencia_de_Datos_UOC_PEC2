It was a glowing green in color and seemed circular.  Size proportionate to a dorm refrigerator. I operate a small business in Powhatan VA, a rural county west of Richmond.  Thursday night, March 9,2000, at approximately 7pm I was on the front porch with my husband.  It was dark.  We were listening to music and I was just looking out towards our horse field when I saw a glowing green object swoop down onto the pasture and proceed to move horizontally but in a circular fashion to the north going up the field.  It irradiated a green color and lasted about 5-8 seconds and just disappeared.  Mu husband was not looking that way and saw nothing.  It seemed about almost as high as our 2-story house so it was fairly low to the ground.  I ruled out a child's toy or anything else and for lack of a better word, call it a ufo.  I have no idea what it was.;37.5453;-77.9187000000001
