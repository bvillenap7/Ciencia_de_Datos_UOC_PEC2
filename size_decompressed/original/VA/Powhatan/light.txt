Every night around 12:00pm, over the skys in Flintrock Powhatan Virginia, there have been about 100 or so objects, bright yellow, white, that shoot around my house, they make no noise what-so-ever, they dart across the sky and into fields, and they pass through the dense woods without ever crashing, or even slowing down. These lights have even come to the windows of my house, not actually stopping, but just passing by in groups of about 10, wizzing by at around 300 mph, this can be judged from my past experience as a local Powhatan cop. Every night for about a week, these lights have been appearing, I don't know what to do. But if anyone else has experienced these lights, contact me at ((personal data deleted)). I will keep you informed of these lights, along with pictures soon, from my digital camera.;37.5453;-77.9187000000001
