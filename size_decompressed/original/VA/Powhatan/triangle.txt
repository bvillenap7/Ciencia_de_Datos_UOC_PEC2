Triangle craft with one large softwhite light on wingtip each and multi-color nose lights in a oblong area.;1988-03-08 05:20:00;12 sec.;Triangle craft with one large softwhite light on wingtip each and multi-color nose lights in a oblong area. The Object I saw had to be black. Why? This Object passed directly over my head no more then approx 70'. It was Approx 5:20 in the morning , a clear starry morning, as this craft very slowly passed from my right then over my head silently then perhaps 20' over a tree. This craft had one softlight Big white light on each wingtip and the nose light consisted of multi-color lights neatly packed in an oblong shaped area. The big white lights were easy on the eyes,The nose lights did not blink or pulse. I felt no downward air or heat as it glided over me.Only I think a slight very low blowing noise. I witnessed this object in 1988 while at my job outside a cottage at Beaumont Juvenile Correctional Center as I was about to re-enter Bell Cottage after a task given Me.  I learned a little over a year later another Officer had watched it from another Cottage Window.  He told me It was a wedge shape with lights that was hovering by the Infirmary then started to move slowly down Cottage row then suddenly speed away very fast.   I've always since have belived this craft was trying to sneak over me as I approuched Bell Cottage  But my eye caught it as it moved toward me overhead.   Also, I want to say I served 4 years in the Air Force in Fuels and know alot about aircraft.  This object is like nothing Iv'e ever witness before.  And these Objects are real without a doubt!  There is NOTHING WRONG with my eyes!! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));37.5453;-77.9187000000001
