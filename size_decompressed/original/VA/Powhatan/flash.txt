I was following behind my fiance in my car, going west on Route 60 through Powhatan.  We had just entered the county line.  It was dark and cloudy outside with a good amount of wind and a slight drizzle.   We both saw a huge bright blue flash from above the clouds that turned red towards the north part of the sky.  It looked like an explosion from behind the clouds.   I turned my music off and listened for a boom or sound and it was silent.   This happened 20 minutes ago and there are no thunderstorms or severe weather in the area.;37.5453;-77.9187000000001
