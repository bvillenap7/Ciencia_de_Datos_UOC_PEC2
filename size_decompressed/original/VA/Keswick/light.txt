5 redish orange lights/fireballs moving slowly across the sky, at one point in w formation.;2015-08-14 22:00:00;10 minutes;5 redish orange lights/fireballs moving slowly across the sky, at one point in w formation. 5 glowing orange red lights/fireballs not blinking slowly made their way across the sky from east-ish to west-ish.  At first thought they were brightly glowing planets but they were too big and I realized they were moving.   Then I thought they were planes but they moved too close together and the lights weren't blinking.   At one point, they were in a perfect w formation directly in front of me across the sky as I was driving towards them.  They kept moving slowly across until I lost sight them because of tree cover.  I am an attorney and was returning home late in the evening. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.  PD));38.0547;-78.3348
