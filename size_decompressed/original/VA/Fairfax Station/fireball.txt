Red/Orange Fireballs in the Sky;2013-04-27 21:45:00;2 minutes;Red/Orange Fireballs in the Sky I stepped outside at approximately 9:45 PM and looked north.  I saw one large bright red/orange ball, glowing very brightly, traveling from east to west.  A second ball appeared from behind the trees just a little higher than the first's path, then a third followed immediately after.  No more followed these 3. They were traveling very close to a typical flight path where I tend to see airplanes, but these were larger than a normal airplane light and were not blinking.;38.7616;-77.3017
