It flew very quickly. I could see its trail outside the ball, it was a lighter glowing orange.  It flew for a total of 3 seconds across the sky.  It looked to have gone about 600 ft if I measured it with the trees, but I felt it was much further away.   I fell silent upon seeing it, tears fled my eyes, my face became incredibly flushed, it felt as if a wave of strange sensation fell upon my face, goose bumps developed, all of this happened within the 3 seconds.   I immediately tried to call my boyfriend, but my phone wouldn't send out calls until I restarted it.;37.4561116564417;-77.6500331288342

All 5 were amber and red in color, a very rich pretty color.  They traveled at a steady pace all in the same direction headed north - east from our position.  The five of us witnesses could not identify what we know we saw.  We believe it is much like the objects seen by the lady in Harrisburg, PA last week.;37.4561116564417;-77.6500331288342
