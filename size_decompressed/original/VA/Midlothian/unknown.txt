Two objects seen flying together over Chesterfield,VA;2021-09-04 21:00:00;30 seconds;Two objects seen flying together over Chesterfield,VA My wife and I were fishing on a dock at Swift Creek Reservoir around 9:00 on Saturday 9/4/2021. We were looking up at the stars trying to identify which were planets and which were stars. I noticed a very small, faint object which appeared to be at a very high altitude moving at what looked to me as a very fast speed. I thought that maybe my eyes hadn’t adjusted to the darkness and maybe the object was a glare of some sort in my vision from looking up for so long. I looked away from the object and focused on a star that was nearby. The object kept going and I was able to clearly follow it across the sky (west to east). I yelled at my wife “Do you see that? She came over and could see it immediately. As we followed it, it seemed to start to “wobble”. Then a second object appeared next to the original one. They maintained the same path of flight but looked as if they were spinning around each other. The two began to change course and head north. This is when t! hey began to drift apart at the same rate of speed almost mirroring each other. As they got further away they both appeared to “wobble” again and they just flew away until we could no longer see them .;37.4561116564417;-77.6500331288342
