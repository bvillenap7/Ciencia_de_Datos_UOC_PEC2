On the evening of January 8th, 2002 my girlfriend and I were coming back from my brothers house that lives in Mosely, Va. ( approximate;2002-01-08 20:30:00;5 minutes;On the evening of January 8th, 2002 my girlfriend and I were coming back from my brothers house that lives in Mosely, Va. ( approximately 20 miles south west of Richmond, VA) I was driving in the east bound lane on highway 360. I spotted this cluster of yellowish orange lights with a large red pulsing light from a distance of about a mile away. The most peculiar thing about this, at that moment in time was the distance of the red pulsing light to the cluster of lights. The red pulsing light was hanging below the cluster of lights. This object/craft was heading west(towards us). I had the video camera with us in the truck. The model is a Sony TRV520 digital video camera with a 20X optical zoom. So, I found a good spot to pull over. My girlfriend and I both got out of the truck.  I grabbed the video camera and she grabbed the binoculars. After realizing that we still had the lens cover on the camera I was able to get the craft focused and zoomed in on it. This is the most bizarre craft I have ever seen. It flew under a star, and as it did, you can still see the star. Transparent? The craft is a cluster of small lights in a hexagon formation. There is a triangular portion in the front from which the large red pulsing light is affixed. I have video of the craft. I will be submitting still images which are video captures to Peter Davenport/NUFORC ((NUFORC Note:  We have viewed the video and the stills, and some object apparently was captured on film by the witness.  We do not know what the object was, but judging from the video, it seems to have generated a noise that sounds to us similar to the noise generated by a jet aircraft.  However, I emphasize that we have no idea what the object is.  PD));37.4561116564417;-77.6500331288342
i reported 2 star like lights to the police and then within 15 min there was a dozen aircraft giving chace north from richmond va 2 D.C;2010-07-03 22:10:00;15.min;i reported 2 star like lights to the police and then within 15 min there was a dozen aircraft giving chace north from richmond va 2 D.C I was driving west on highway 60 with my girlfriend at approx. 10:05-10:10pm on july 3rd 2010.  I saw 2 star like objects at 1-oclock and 5-oclock low in the night air.  I called the non emergency police and reported what we had seen and asked if any one had reported anything simalar. Im not sure how serious she thought i was. We had a solid minute looking at the objects before we had to turn into our neighborhood.  We got home a few seconds later and walked out front in the road to see if we could see them from our house. Then we saw a aircraft coming over head silentley that displayed 4 lights. green, red, blue and white.  It looked to be coming down heading north towards D.C. then it turned into one solid star like object and started going upwards never changing course.  Then to my amazment we saw 2 triangular objects with bright white lights in each corner coming over head silentley, slowly, and pretty low also heading north. They were both low enough that i could confidently say that it was a dark metalic looking aircraft. With in a 15 min. span we saw over a dozen aircraft flyin north almost like they were giving chase?   I had just reported them first 2 lights to the police just 20 min, earlier.  It was ruly mind boggeling!!;37.4561116564417;-77.6500331288342
