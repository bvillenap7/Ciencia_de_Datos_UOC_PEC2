I woke up, to get the door, since my mother in law went country line dancing and was returning home. Something had me look at the window in the family room and I noticed that something with Blue, Red, and White Lights was surveying (the only words I can use to describe how it was moving) the woods. The distance was about 5 to maybe 10 miles from my house, it was hovering over the wooded area just either circling or going back and forth. When it would move in the west direction, the lights red and blue would appear. Then when it returned movement back toward the east a bright white light would shine down, like it was surverying something. I noticed it first, then went upstairs and grabbed my mother in law, and we both went on the deck to watch this happen. It would not stop and there was no noise coming from the object. I watched it for about 10 minutes, then I noticed that another object was flying across the woods, and went in the west direction, this object was a solid red color, like a ball or something. Still watching the bigger object, another object that was white in color and long (cigar shape) went in the west direction as well. Both secondary objects disappeared from my view. It was weird.

Ball of lights very far out in the AM sky over 23112;2011-12-29 06:30:00;20 min;Ball of lights very far out in the AM sky over 23112 On 12/29/2011 at 6:30 AM I saw a cluster of lights over Midlothian VA. It was very far out and did not look like it was moving. If it was moving it was very slight.  My wife and daughter looked but said it was nothing or a star.  I got some binoculars and with those it looked like a perfect ball of lights.  And looked like a pretty dense pattern of lights.  Thatâ€™s all I got.  Thanks;37.4561116564417;-77.6500331288342
We saw a bright green ball of light last night moving steadily across the sky in a straight line. ((anonymous report));2016-07-29 00:26:00;2 minutes;We saw a bright green ball of light last night moving steadily across the sky in a straight line.  The object did not streak fast like a meteor and was very easy to track.  It crossed directly over the house and we ran out front to see it continue in the same line before it disappeared behind the tree line.  My feeling was that the object was large and quite high up in the sky.  I was very surprised to see no mention of this on social media or news sites since this object was very bright and noticeable since it remained visible the entire time we were watching it.  The only thing I could assume is that, because it was late and this is the suburbs, people simply weren't outside and didn't observe it.
