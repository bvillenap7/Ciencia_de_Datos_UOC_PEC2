My female friend and I were walking around her condo.;2006-10-28 22:00:00;6 seconds;My female friend and I were walking around her condo. A night we could clearly see a series of lights in a chevron pattern. If you made a chevron with your fingers and held them at arms length, that would be the initial size. Her response was 'well look at that&quot. The lights were somewhat brighter than the stars as we could see Orion. As the lights got closer to us from  45deg angle to overhead they changed to amber and it appeared to grow in size. I could see the amber lights recesed into a round fixture and they were now about the size of a dime held at arms length. Other that that, I could not see a defined structure, wing etc. The lights were definately attached to some kind of structure because they did not wobble, very stable. We watched it until the trees blocked the view. It was silent, no humm no airplane. We did not speak for about a minute. Just awed at what we witnessed that night. I told her to draw what she saw and I drew what I saw. The only difference in the drawings was she had more lights than I. It seemed to grow larger as it glided silently overhead. I am 60 years old and will never forget what we saw. Very much like wittnesses saw when describing a variation of the Phoenix lights.
