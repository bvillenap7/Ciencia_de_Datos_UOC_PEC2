Unreported 1992 Sighting;1992-04-15 19:30:00;roughly 2 minutes;Unreported 1992 Sighting When I was 14, a friend and I were riding our bikes in a subdivision of our then quaint little town when, in the distance, I spotted an egg shaped aircraft flying above the large, two pronged radio transmission tower.  I pointed the object out to my friend who said it reminded him of the UFO in the film Flight of the Navigator  We watched it smoothly fly across the sky until it faded from site. I don't know if this qualifies to be posted since it was reported twelve years after the fact, but I thought maybe you'd like to know ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
