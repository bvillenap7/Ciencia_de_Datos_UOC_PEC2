I went to walk my dog around 8 pm. I stepped outside and let the pouch pee. As soon as i looked up from my dog I noticed this large light a good distance away. It was yellow/gold and just sat there. At this moment I'm just thinking, That's a pretty big light.  I don't remember exactly how big the light was, but it was pretty big, bigger than any of the stars or other lights around.  So after staring at this light for a moment, it began to move to the left pretty fast. While moving, the light disappeared but left three other small lights in a line. It continued moving to the left, then stopped. The large yellow light came back, except it was blinking. It moved back to the right, still going pretty fast, and while it was moving back, the yellow light would dim till it wasn't seen. It stopped again, and three small lights came on, two yellow, 1 red. And at this time i realized it was quite a distance away, which then means that the yellow light was maybe bright! er than i thought. So anyways, it went back to moving to the left, then came back to the right once more, and encountered another triplet of lights identical to itself. Both pairs of lights stopped when they were close together, then they both continued to go, the original lights kept going right, and the others, left until both were out of sight. At first i thought, Well maybe it's a plane.. but planes don't emit that kind of a light, and wouldn't go in that kind of a pattern, back and forth.;37.4561116564417;-77.6500331288342
Lights moving erratically in night sky.;2016-05-08 21:00:00;3 minutes;Lights moving erratically in night sky At approximately 9:00 pm, or slightly after, my wife and I were leaving our daughter's house after a Mother's Day dinner.  As I stepped into the driveway, I noticed what appeared to be an airplane moving about 30 degrees to our left.  It was visible right beside the crescent moon.  I didn't really pay much attention until I saw it suddenly come to a dead stop and hover for 2 or 3 seconds and begin to move back the way it had come.  I called to my family and 6 adults all saw the object moving at seemingly random directions in the same area.  Again it appeared about 30 to 45 degrees off the horizon of trees, and was near the location of the crescent moon.  The event last for maybe two or 3 minutes before the object moved below the tree line and out of our sight. The object appeard to have 3 solid red lights, close together in a vertical triangular shape.  It had a flashing white light very similar to an airplane marker light and that's why I didn't initially react to it.  The object was about the size of a pencil eraser held at arm's length or maybe just a bit larger.  It moved slowly traversing no more than about 10 degrees arc, primarily traversing from our right to left, back and forth, up and down.  It was absolutely silent.  Unfortunately, we had no frame of reference to guage its size or distance from us. I joked about a UFO but also suggested a drone closer to us as it seemed a more likely explanation.  However, if it was a drone, I would have thought we would be able to hear it. None of us was remotely frightened but all were very curious.;37.4561116564417;-77.6500331288342
