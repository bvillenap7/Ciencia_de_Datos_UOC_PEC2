Extremely three bright  lights that were shooting start fast.;2013-02-23 06:50:00;10 minutes;Extremely three bright  lights that were shooting start fast. PLEASE HELP!!! Im not joking. A few minutes ago I was walking my Dalmatian, Harley and I saw three BRIGHT lights.  As I was watching them IT zoomed across the sky.  Trust me I have seen jets, shooting stars and tons of fast planes.   At first I thought this was a bright shooting star but about 5 sec. later it ZOOMED back.  It was the FASTEST thing I have ever seen.   So I sprinted home, yelled at my mom and sister to go onto the deck to see this.  She called her friend/our neighbor and we watched.  They did see it come to a hault and this thing was silent.  I have much experience air  planes fly over all the time. And this thing did NOT make a noise.  It also stopped and completely changed directions.   I AM FREAKED OUT AND PUZZLED ALONG WITH MY FRIENDS/FAMILY!!!!!;37.4561116564417;-77.6500331288342
Three red rights shaped like a triangle.;2013-12-25 20:00:00;3 minutes;Three red rights shaped like a triangle I walked outside to let the dogs do their buisness and notice three red-tinted lights in a triangular shape slowly rotating.  Then after a few minutes the lights one at a time slowly faded away to nothing.  The fading happened within 30 seconds. No noise was heard.;37.4561116564417;-77.6500331288342
