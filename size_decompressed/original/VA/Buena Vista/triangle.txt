Triangle Shaped Craft Hoovering over small town in VA.;2001-04-25 03:40:00;5 minutes;Triangle Shaped Craft Hoovering over small town in VA. A friend an I were walking home and looked up into the air. There was a small triangular shaped craft in the air. We both looked to see if it could possibly be wings of a plane, but if they were, there was no back end of the plane. It had some sort of bright 'headlight' leading its course which I myself have never seen on an airplane. On the extruding side, it had small green lights on each end, but i have been familiar with only red ones on a plane, but never in pairs. The wierd thing the two of us noticed was that from its low altitude, it was not making the slightest noise. Our town was quiet as could be at 3:40 AM also. Another wierd thing about the craft, was that it was hoovering, not as much flying. It was late, neither one of us were drastically tired, intoxicated, nor had any drugs in our bodies and are truthfull behind what we saw. This may have been an airplane, because there are 3 airports in a 50 mile radius, but, a triangular airplane, with side green lights, and a bright headlight?;37.7406;-79.3422
