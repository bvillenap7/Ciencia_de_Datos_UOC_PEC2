Blue orb seen in southwest mountains of Virginia in 1999.;1999-03-13 05:55:00;10 seconds;Blue orb seen in Southwest mountains of Virginia in 1999. I was on my way to pick up a friend for a trip to Charlotte, NC.  I was about 10 miles west of Galax, VA, in a very rural, sparsely populated, area of the Blue Ridge Mountains.  It was 5:55 am.   As I drove south on Cold Springs Lane near my friend's house, I noticed a blue orb approaching from the west.  It was about the size of a tennis ball.  It was silhouetted against a mountain ridge in front of me and about 15 degrees above my position.  Due to these facts I know it was low and moving slow.  It appeared to be moving up the whole time I observed it.  It exited my field of vision to the east behind a grove of trees.
