I was facing north, 2 bright amber glowing objects, moving together due W across the sky. ((anonymous report));2017-05-20 21:02:00;120 seconds;I was facing north, 2 bright amber glowing objects which reminded me of fireworks, moving together due west across the sky.  The top one wound up traveling fully to the left and disappearing halfway across the sky and the light changed as it got smaller, the bottom one dropped down at a harsh angle and also disappeared as it approached the horizon, slightly above the treeline.
