I watched it for about 5-7 seconds untill it was blocked from my view by some trees. I then got up & went up to my fence so that I couls see it again when it came out from behind the trees. I did see it again for approximately 3 more seconds untill again it went behind some trees. The object was traveling 3 to 4 times faster then any jet airpalne that I've ever seen, perhaps faster. There was no sound relative to this object. There was no deviation of it's coarse, it traveled in a straight line. Perhaps it was a satellite but the satellites I've seen previosuly were at night & much slower.;37.6537903846153;-77.3307374999999
