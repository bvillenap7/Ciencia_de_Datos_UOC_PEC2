2 disk shaped UFO's over Mechanicsville, VA.;2006-06-26 03:00:00;About 30 sec.;2 disk shaped UFO's over Mechanicsville, VA. I was trying to trace a drawing when I saw them. I put the real drawing underneath a blank piece of paper and held it up to the window to try and use the sunlight to trace it. Thats when I saw one disk shaped UFO that looked like it was kind of far away, then about 7 seconds later another UFO appeared. This time I grabbed my camera and snapped a picture. It didd'nt come out verry good because they were moving pretty fast but you can still see them. Then another 10 seconds and they were gone. Since everyone who lives near me had gone to worK this morning, I think I was the only one to see them.  ((NUFORC Note:  We cannot be certain as to whether this is supposed to be a serious report.
