At approximately 10:00 pm flashes of light started appearing above a line of trees over the town of Stanardsville, Virginia.  They were moving very fast and when we first saw them they were very high up in the sky.  After a few minutes, they started dropping down into the trees then started coming closer to houses and outside sheds. It is hard to say how many it was but it seemed the longer we watched the more there were.  We also saw a stationary light near the mountains which are considered Skyline Drive.  It was yellow and orange in color. We've never seen anything like this before. I am 45 yrs. old, my son also observed this and he is 19 yrs. old and my Mother also saw this and she is 72 yrs. old and has lived in this area most of her life.;38.2586;-78.4074
