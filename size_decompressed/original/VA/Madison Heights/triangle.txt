Three red lights in triangle shape hovering.;2016-07-03 09:20:00;2-3 minutes;Three red lights in triangle shape hovering. After hearing fireworks nearby we went outside to look at the sky, but what we first saw was three red lights in a triangular shape hovering in the distance.  They did not appear to be moving but when we got to the camera on our phone one had already become far enough away as to not be seen by the naked eye.  The other lights did the same one by one. The sky had been cloudy the entire day so no stars or normal night sky was visible at this time. We have never witnessed anything like this before.;37.4532;-79.1091
