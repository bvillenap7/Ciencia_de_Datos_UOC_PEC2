Next to Venus is a giant orb of multi-color light.  ((NUFORC Note:  Rocket launch from Wallops Island.  PD));2017-06-29 05:00:00;10 minutes;So what just happened a little while ago blew my mind.  Coming home from work, I get out my car and I look into the sky and I see Venus (a normal night sky star) but then next to it is a giant orb of multi-color light.  No bright.  But prominent in the night sky.   As I'm staring at it, it starts pulsating, and I immediately fumble for my phone so I can try and record and take pictures.  Which didn't turn out as great as I hoped.  But then the singular ball breaks off into the 4 balls shown in the picture and continuous break down into more faint balls.  A total of 9, I believe?   But then became more faint as they broke down.  Until eventually it become a glowing mist blob that dissipated.   Was truly a breathtaking experience.  The one picture turned out better than I had expected.  And is beautiful but confusing at the same time.  You can see the outline of the colors and in the last few the glowing mist I was talking about.  Idk what to make of this.  (the photos where enhanced so that way they could be seen better) ((NUFORC Note:  Rocket launch from Wallops Island.  PD));38.1551;-79.0608000000001
