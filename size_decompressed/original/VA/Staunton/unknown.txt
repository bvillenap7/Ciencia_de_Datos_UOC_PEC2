This actually happened in 2005 but I remember it like it was last night. I was a junior in high school then but it was a weekend. I lived in Willow View Apartments in Staunton Va.  I had been hanging out around the apts with friends all day as usual and it was starting to get late...prob around midnight or so. Everyone decided to call it a night except for me and one of my friends so we walked up to my apt and sat on the steps talking and joking around. I was getting ready to call it a night myself when I happened to look out in the horizon and I saw it!  Staunton is a very hilly city and where I lived was on a hill so when looking at the horizon you can see very far and notice distinct land features(mountains,ECT...)  With one mountain really more of a really big hill to the SW of my porch that to me always looked to be out of place being an almost perfect pyramid with no other mountains close to it. Back to the story when I looked out there I noticed a very very bright light right above the peak of that oddly shaped mountain.  It looked the same as someone pointing a bright flashlight about 100 yards away from would look.  It did not move and did not make any noise that I could here.  After staring for a moment or two and letting it process in my brain I pointed it out to my friend.  We both agreed that it was way way to big and bright to be a star or planet and could tell it was far off but not very far probably within 10 to 50 miles. We watched it for what seemed like forever but was really about ten minutes and it didn't move or dim or even flicker the whole time.  Then out of nowhere as we both were watching as fast as you can blink it just simply disappeared like it was somebodies huge lightbulb and they hit the switch.  It never came back and have never seen it again.;38.1551;-79.0608000000001
It was flying low and loud and must have been several because the roar lasted long.;2015-09-03 23:00:00;30 minutes;It was flying low and loud and must have been several because the roar lasted long. Was ready for bed, heard sound like a very very long train OVERHEAD IN SKY.  I DID NOT LOOK OUT.    WHEN THE ROAR FINALLY STOPPED, I went downstairs and told my husband...just as we heard a loud sound like a large airplane flying low over our home.   I keyed in on internet, AIRPLANES OVER STAUNTON VS 11:30 pm TODAY, and got this site.;38.1551;-79.0608000000001
