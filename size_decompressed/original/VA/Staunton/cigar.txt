Cigar w/ two lights (--).  Staunton, VA;2003-10-26 23:00:00;1.5 hrs.;Cigar w/ two lights (--).  Staunton, VA Noticed object in sky SW of Staunton, VA at about 11:00 PM.  Watched for over an hour.  Object moved in every direction in short bursts.  It moved around, but stayed in the same general area.  Looked like two long slender lights parallel to the ground, like this --.  Viewed object in sky until I fell asleep around 12:30 AM.  This object was quicker and more agile in the air than I can explain.  It would take off real quick in a straight line, then seem to turn 90 degrees, then up and down and left and right.  No blinking lights on this craft either.  Can't tell how far away it was.  I feel sure there will be more reports than this one about this sighting.  I don't know what this thing was, but it was pulling off manuevers that I think could be beyond human technology at this time(public technology).;38.1551;-79.0608000000001
