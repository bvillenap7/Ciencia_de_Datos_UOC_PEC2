Silent Cloaked object with 2 witness and radio interference;2002-08-08 04:00:00;5min;Silent Cloaked object with 2 witness and radio interference Hello,  This is my story.  It was probably around 2002 this happened.  I was in Staunton VA, on the Blue Ridge Parkway, at one of those scenic overlooks . It was dark, probably 3-4am.  My boss liked to take us out to bar after work, me and my coworker took her car to the overlook when we left. First thing that was weird – there was all manner of animal on the parkway that night.  Deer, skunk, opossum, fox, rabbit, even some cows randomly in the ditch on the way up. We’re at the overlook taking in the stars.  I have a handheld police scanner radio I kept with me at the time.  It was on, I had it in my hand or it was in the car fairly close. Through the trees, which would be off the side of the mountain, my first impression was someone had launched a firework. There was a sudden bright flash of only green light, not one point, but a firework like burst. There was no explosion, or ‘report’ from a firework. The color burst moved over the trees, and behind us on the road. About the time the ‘firework’ appeared, the police scanner (which was in scan mode) started picking up on static, I tried manually cycling though channels and every channel was static. The Object was no longer a burst of firework, but a nearly invisible blob shape that hovered over the road probably 100 feet or so from us and maybe 30 feet off the road.  There was never any sound except the static on the scanner. Within a few moments the object took off following the road. We were so stunned we did not consider following it. Thank you for your time.;38.1551;-79.0608000000001
