1 rectangle ship flying beside rt.262 staunton va;2007-11-15 02:00:00;1 minute;1 rectangle ship flying beside rt.262 staunton va i was on my way home from dropping a friend off and before i seen the object i noticed that i was the only person driving down a main road, i was on my phone when i seen a blue ball shoot over the hill in the distance. i took a glance and it was like it drew me in, i couldnt help but watch.. as i watched it came closer until it was 20 feet from my driver door flying beside the guard rail (it is a 20 foot plus drop below it). it was a perfect rectangle with no windows but it had 4 huge white lights on the side and a 50 foot long jetstream of the most insane color blue i have ever seen to this day. it was so strange because the ship was dead silent!! i was going 60mph when it came along side of me and as it started to speed up and get ahead of me i hit the gas to follow and by the time i hit 64 or 65mph it came on the road in front of me and shot (litterally SHOT) into the sky... it scared me more than anything i have ever been through or seen, i was a total n! on-believer before i seen this..... i dont know if it was aliens or the government but it was out of this world all the same......
