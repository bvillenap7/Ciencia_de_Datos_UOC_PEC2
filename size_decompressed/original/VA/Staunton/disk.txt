Saucer seen over Staunton, Virginia;2008-10-03 18:00:00;5 mins;Saucer seen over Staunton, Virginia My two friends and I were sitting at a stoplight in Staunton. We were getting ready to get on the interstate to go to Harrisonburg. They noticed something strange in the sky. It was hard to see at first because it was just above the mountains and other buildings on the horizon. We watched it wobble and hover and discerned that it was saucer-shaped and has red and blue flashing lights. The lights went up the sides of the craft instead of along it, like an airplane might. I attempted to take pictures with my digital camera, but it didn't really work. Although when looking at the pictures on the computer, there are orange streaks where the saucer should be. Interestingly, the saucer was grayish and had red and blue lights. When the stoplight turned green, we drove away and the saucer continued its slow wobble to the northwest. We are still not sure if this object was truely a UFO, but there seemed ti be little else it could be.;38.1551;-79.0608000000001
