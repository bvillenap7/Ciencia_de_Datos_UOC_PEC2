Orange white ball of light east of Harrisonburg VA;2020-05-16 04:45:00;10 minutes;Orange white ball of light east of Harrisonburg VA Not usually up at this time but happened to look out my window early the morning of 5/16/20 and noticed a bright orange-white object in the sky East from my vantage point in western VA. Because of clouds moving across the sky, the object was in and out of my view and at one point seemed to change shape..almost a rectangular shape, small end up. I could not discern any movement, it seemed to be stationary.This was a very bright light tho not quite neon. Eventually disappeared or was covered by clouds tho I did hang around to see if it would reappear...it did not.;38.4564295154186;-78.86005154185
