Very bright disk shape eastern sky Harrisonburg. ;2009-09-19 19:50:00;1 minute 30 sec;Very bright disk shape eastern sky Harrisonburg I was standing on the porch and looking toward Eastern sky. A disk shape object appeared and got brighter and brighter. A cone shape of light came down slowly from the disk. I do not know the elevation, but a plane flew under the object and the plane looked in comparison to be an ant. It was huge and was the brightest light I have ever seen. As the plane flew underneath it dissapated and was gone.  The cone shape light emitting could have been the smoke from a missile, but why would it retract up when the plane flew underneath and the smoke not lose its shape?  Called UFO hotline and was told it was a test missile.  If this was a test missile why are they shooting missiles in a flight zone and at night. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.
