What caught my attention was a bright light up and southward, I said “wow that sure is a big bright star” after looking at it about 2-3 seconds it started moving south for about 3-4 seconds then it stopped for 1-2 seconds then started moving again for about 2-3 seconds then stopped again for 1-2 seconds,  at that time I was right outside the door so I rushed in to grab my binoculars, because that was just weird, which took about 3 seconds, when I came back out and looked at it was still moving south for about 4-5 seconds then got dim real quick and disappeared.  I’m not sure what it was while looking through my weak binoculars I couldn’t really make anything out, I couldn’t get them to focus in time. 6-11-08 As usual I was out on the back porch smoking, not sure probably around 9 or 10pm, and of course I looked up at the sky and I can usually see satellites often, well I spotted one heading north as I watched it for about 8 seconds, it got real bright for about 4-5 seconds still moving then got dim quickly as I followed it with my eyes until I couldn’t see it anymore lasting about 4 seconds. 6-12-08 Weird enough, it was about 10:30-11pm at the time, and I was talking to my mom over the phone out on the back porch as I was talking to her I was looking up at the sky, and saw a satellite directly overhead heading north so I followed it with my eyes for about 8 seconds while still talking on the phone and I started laughing at mom and looked down from the sky about 3 seconds then looked back up again and saw the same satellite going the opposite way southward, I am just freaked out a little from the past 3 days of weird stuff in the sky, I don’t know if this means anything , but I’ve been trying to see online if anyone has seen any of these for the past 3 days and so far I have nothing.;38.4564295154186;-78.86005154185
A contrail was headed toward the ground and then changed direction after 3 more aircraft were drawing near;2020-01-06 13:45:00;15 minutes;A contrail was headed toward the ground and then changed direction after 3 more aircraft were drawing near As I was driving to work I noticed a very short contrail plummeting toward the ground. About 5 minutes go by, and 3 aircraft coming from NE, N, and NW start closing in on the object.  As soon as the aircraft coming in from NE drew near, the contrail changed direction and started heading South.  After 10 more minutes all three aircraft were closing in on the contrail, but that was all I got to see before my exit.;38.4564295154186;-78.86005154185
