Strange lighted craft flies low in Grassy Creeks.;2007-12-23 02:00:00;8 to 10 mins;Strange lighted craft flies low in Grassy Creek. As I was leaving a friend's house, I observed what looked to be a helicopter at street level with its searchlight on.  As i began heading towards it, I noticed that this craft was below the treeline.  As soon as my headlights hit it it began to rise very slowly and the searchlight went off.   I stopped to see what it would do and it began to slowly move left and right still hovering approx. 25 to 30 feet off of the ground.  As it moved closer to me i noticed that there were several lights on the craft some singular and three linear banks of lights.  What was odd was that the lights were not the kind seen on conventional aircraft.  The single lights were very brite white and 2 of the banks were a very brite amber color, and the last bank of lights were both white and yellow and only the yellow lights oscillated.   Also, I noticed that the craft stayed situated exactly the same way as it rose from behind the trees and never moved faster than 2 or 3 mph for as long as I saw it.   A few things about this sighting did not seem to make since.  First, it was wintertime at almost 2 am and the weather was not condusive to flight.  It was like 10 degrees below 0 and the wind was blowing that nite from 25 to 35 mph with gusts up to 60.   I stepped out of my car as it crossed the hood of my car and there were visible means of propulsion or any wings or fuselage for the lights to be attached to no wings or anything other than the lights, it was perfectly silent!   I lost sight of this craft as it slowly went over the house i was stopped in front of.  It was then that I realized that the lights on the craft were configured to look like a helicopter, but it was indeed ABSOLUTELY NOT a helicopter.   I went around the development to re-aquire this craft and never saw it again.   I meant to say there was NO visible means of propulsion! ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is not indicated by witness.

Saw a bright light a few hundred feet in sky.  The object looked as if it were on fire because it was glowing so bright.  Drove closer,;2015-05-10 21:00:00;1 minutes;Saw a bright light a few hundred feet in sky.  The object looked as if it were on fire because it was glowing so bright.  Drove closer and I was almost directly underneath the object.  I got out off my car to get a better look and I saw the object hovering in the sky still glowing bright red.  And no more than a few seconds of watching the craft, it began to move, first very slowly but then it appeared to move in bursts leaving a brief light trail..  It then lit up in a bright white light then the lights turned off. I then saw the very dark silhouette of what appeared to be some sort of air craft.  (It was kind of boxy in shape) and there was no sound what so ever coming from the craft and then it vanished in the distance.   Not saying it was an alien but it may have been a drone..  I'm not sure;38.4564295154186;-78.86005154185
