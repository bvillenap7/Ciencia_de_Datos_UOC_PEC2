Circular object offwhite in color, emiting no sound traveling at supersonic speed.;2001-10-15 17:25:00;3 t0 4 sec.;Circular object offwhite in color, emiting no sound traveling at supersonic speed. Standing on my deck, looking to the Northeast when I notiticed at about 45 t0 60 degrees off the horizon a Circular object. At first I thought it was a Plane of some sort but then I noticed it didn't omit any sound. The object passed by so quickly that I estimate that it was maybe 3500 to 4000 feet high. It may have been a lot higher but I'm not really sure about that. The Object was circular, solid in appearance but without any distinct markings. It almost resembled the color of a cloud.( offwhite) The object I feel was going supersonic speed because it was out of sight in no time at all, headed in a Northeast direction. When I first noticed the object, it was about the size of maybe a nickle or a quarter from my perspective. as it traveled to the Northeast, it rapidly decreased in size rapidly until I lost it over the Horizon. There were no clouds in the shy,just a beautiful evening. This is the first time that I ever noticed anything like this and I tell you that I was really taken back in awe about the event. Could it have been a Satilite, I don't know since the sighting was in daylight.;38.4564295154186;-78.86005154185
Brilliant spherical object traveling S to N at low alt., high rate of speed with no sound. ((NUFORC Note:  Report from USN pilot.  PD));2011-11-12 17:00:00;5 seconds;Brilliant spherical object traveling S to N at low altitude, high rate of speed with no sound. A brilliant spherical object which appeared to be 1 cm to the naked eye traveled from south to north (right to legt).  The object was totally silent, and left no visible trail such as smoke or exhaust.   From my 8 years experience as a Navy pilot, I would estimate that the object was at an altitude of approximately 1000 feet above the ground, at an estimated speed of  600 - 700 knots.   As the object was traveling away, it was observed to slightly vary its course from left to right, rather than follow a ballistic trajectory.;38.4564295154186;-78.86005154185
