Very bright, completely silent, slow moving and flying low over Harrisonburg, VA;2015-05-23 22:00:00;4-5 minutes;Very bright, completely silent, slow moving and flying low over Harrisonburg, VA I was sitting in my living room watching tv, when I noticed  a light moving across the sky through the window.   I went outside expecting to hear a helicopter because it was too low to be a plane.  It was very bright and completely silent moving in a straight line.  It flickered and was almost pink in color.  It was easily seen for four or five minutes and then disappeared.   My husband observed it for a moment with me before it disappeared.  It wasn't so far away that we couldn't see it, it just vanished while it was easily observable!    The sky was very clear, no clouds, and no sound other than cars occasionally on the road.  I could see the lights of planes much farther up but this was much lower and much slower.  Certainly close enough that we should have heard it.;38.4564295154186;-78.86005154185
