Triangles dancing in the sky;2010-10-06 07:50:00;5 minutes;Triangles dancing in the sky It was late dusk with verk low cloud cover and I apologize for my lack of aeronautical knowledge.  I was facing east when I saw 2 blue/white florescent lights hovering below very low cloud cover.  They were a few hundred feet apart and no more than a few miles above my house.  They seemed to be dancing with each other moving in circular patterns quickly accelerating and performing maneuvers in the air that are physically IMPOSIBLE.  They were black triangular silhouttes with one neon/white/blue headlight.  These objects would circle around the sky and accelerate quickly and then stop and move at a measured pace -periodically stoping and floating/hovering in the same spot.  They moved through the air with ameoba like precision and performed calculated routines that seemed to be for surveying the area below.  After 5 minutes due to the cloud cover and the fact that they were headed west (headlight leaving me) I lost track of them.  Again I am not a physici! st but what I just saw defied the laws of nature and gravity and was like nothing I have ever seen or imagined I'd be reporting.;38.4564295154186;-78.86005154185
Triangle, white centerish area with rainbow emitting from it to shape the triangle.  ((anonymous report));2019-04-24 22:45:00;0.5 second;Triangle, white centerish area with rainbow emitting from it to shape the triangle Shape of a right triangle, with a white light in the central area and rainbow emitting from the white light, forming the shape of the triangle.  As soon as I saw it, it compressed or concentrated into a single straight, white line and vanished.  Appeared and disappeared without any sort of special effect.  It appeared as if it was there the whole time and disappeared as if it was never there. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
