As a friend and I were walking across the campus, a ball of light shot past us and then disappeared.  The object was only 20-30 feet above ground, and was no larger than 6-12 inches in diameter.  The speed of the object was somewhere around 30-50mph.  It came from behind, startling my friend and I, then quickly disappeared.  It's flight path was an upward arc, kind of a swooping motion, arcing upward after passing us.  This object made no sound at all.  There were no electrical storms, no powerlines nearby and no one else directly around us.  My friend and I were college students at the time.  I am a former Marine and have had aircraft observation/identification training.  I didn't think much of this incident until I saw video taped evidence of balls of light nearby or directly above crop circle incidents.  When I saw those video images, it brought back to memory what I had seen.  I'm not sure if the object was a spacecraft or some natural anomaly, but it was definitely real.
