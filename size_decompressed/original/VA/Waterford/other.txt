Parallel white lines then flashof light.;2015-11-01 22:44:00;15 seconds;Parallel white lines then flashof light. Damp overcast sky saw two faint white lines thru the cloud cover, space beteen them...not flying on the leesburg, Va approach path helicopter going low from south to north roughly...low and not close to where lines were.  Was to the left of where brighter star is, between 10 and 11 clock in the sky, going towards NE.   There was a flash of light and the lines were gone...weird,  Did not look like lights at all  no sound from above, just heli in background towards Camp David?;39.1888;-77.6258
