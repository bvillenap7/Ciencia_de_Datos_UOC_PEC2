Two bright lights moving mostly south.;2015-07-10 18:02:00;1 minute;Two bright lights moving mostly south Two bright lights heading South by West.  One following the other separated by three fingers at arm's length.   Clear sky, some high clouds.  No sound, however they were very far away.  About 40 degrees above horizon.   This area is in the landing pattern for Dulles airport and they were using no typical path through the area.  Below clouds but no idea of altitude.   I moved some as there were power lines and trees to look around but seemed that both disappeared, that is did not fly out of my sight line.   I first thought they were just airplanes with sun glint, but the two together was unusual and it just didn't seem right.;39.1888;-77.6258
