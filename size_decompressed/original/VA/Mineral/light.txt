An large light was noted coming from east towards the west.  The light was moving towards us but to the side (its left) a cloudy area was illulminated with light also.  We watched, thinking it was an airplane with landing lights on but wondering what the cloud to its left was.  Suddenly the light dissappeared but the hazy area remained for a short time.  Nothing else remained.  We continued watching thinking an thinking something should remain--absolutely nothing. I first spotted the object.  I am ((medical professional)).  My husband is attending ((school deleted)) to attain a ((subject deleted)) degree.  Of the other two witnesses, one is an orderly in a hospital and the other works in city goverment.  We are all over forty years of age.  This area is extremely rural.
