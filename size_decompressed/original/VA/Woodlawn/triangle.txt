Triangle of 3 white lights over Woodlawn, VA;2010-06-15 20:30:00;20 seconds;Triangle of 3 white lights over Woodlawn, VA I was standing on the front porch of my house when I happened to look up. I saw a series of three small white lights, arranged in a triangle formation about 10 to 15 feet in diameter. The lights were blinking erratically, and they appeared to be moving east at a very high speed.  There was no sound emitting from the object, and it appeared to me to be about 450 to 500 feet above, about a half-mile away.  I observed the object for around 10 seconds before I stepped inside to alert my cousins. Unfortunately, before they could join me outside, the object had already disappeared over the tree line.
