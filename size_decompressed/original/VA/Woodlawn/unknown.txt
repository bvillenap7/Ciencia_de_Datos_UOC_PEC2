UFO TRAVELING AT SAME RATE AND SPEED FLYING PERFECTLY RIGHT BESIDE AN AIRPLANE;2004-03-20 06:00:00;about 5 min.;UFO TRAVELING AT SAME RATE AND SPEED FLYING PERFECTLY RIGHT BESIDE AN AIRPLANE Later in the afternoon, me and my buddy was outside his house waiting at his car for my dad to come pick us up. We were talking and I looked up in the sky and I saw an airplane. The weird thing was that there was another flying object flying perfectly right beside the airplane. I mean it was going at the same exact speed that the airplane was, without moving or turning or anything. The unknown object beside the airplane looked as though it was larger than the airplane and it had a very bright glow to it. But the oddest thing about the object was that, unlike the airplane, it looked as though it was floating through the air and there was no smoke cloud left behind it like all flying aircrafts make when theyre being flown. Which leads me to believe that this was a supernatural occurence and that it was a UFO. After about 4 or 5 minutes the object and the airplane got so far away that they werent visible to us any longer. I wonder if anyone in that plane saw anything during their flight and if their were any reports? It was so high up, I couldnt tell what shape it was. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
