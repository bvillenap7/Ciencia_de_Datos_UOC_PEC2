I, my wife and stepson saw a orange/red/white light sitting in the sky.  At first sight thought it was a star, but the more I watched it I noticed it was oscillating then it moved latterly across the sky probably a half mile in a second or two. then shot back to where it started.  After that it shot over the opposite direction probably the same distance and once again back to original starting point.  It then was oscillating and after a couple minuets began to fly straight towards my house in a very uncontrolled manner.  As it came closer it got higher and faster as it went. Tonight was a similar occurrence but it seemed to be 3 lights in a triangle and the main light had blue orbs entering and exiting the light. there appears to be multiple main lights tonight at different elevations all in triangle formations.  This is very much freaking me out, because they seem frequent and lots of them. does any one know or seen these things?;37.0602;-80.3226
