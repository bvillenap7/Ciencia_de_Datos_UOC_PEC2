((HOAX??)  Watching this super bright obj. in sky for several mounts now.  Can see in at night, dawn, and dusk clearly.  ((Venus??));2017-03-12 20:43:00;25 seconds;Been watching this super bright object in sky for several mounts now.  Can see in at night dawn and dusk clearly. Tonight we watched it as usual and it just took off and shot actoss the horizon toards new york.  We thought at first it was the north star, it was so bright, but later we found out it was not.  Not shown on any stat charts or planet. ((NUFORC Note:  Polaris, the North Star, is not a very bright star.  We have amended the time above, in order to reflect a nighttime sighting.  We attempted to contact the source of the report via telephone, but the number is not valid.  We receive many, many hoaxed calls and reports from Virginia, and we wonder whether this one might be yet another.  PD));37.4149;-76.5441
