Large white light;2012-01-27 22:00:00;1 min 30;large white light I had just arrived home after getting groceries late Friday evening Jan. 27, 2012. My oldest son was helping to unload the groceries out of the back of the car when I got a phone call and sat down on our screened in porch talking on the phone with my husband on his way to work.  All of a sudden my son said, What is that in the sky? Then he really got scared when it finally moved.  When I first viewed it, it was a HUGE ball of white and appeared totally round in the sky and it was really low.  It didn't appear to be moving but hovering.  Then it slowly moved upward and then stopped. It proceeded to move to the right in the sky (our left) above the trees.  As it moved to the left of us we could see there was a small steady red light that was on the end of this object.  As large as this object was there was absolutely no sound.  It proceeded behind the trees at a very quick speed behind the neighbors yard across the road until it was no longer visible.  What could th! is have been?  The scariest thing is that I saw this EXACT same object do the same exact thing at what appeared to be the same area of the sky maybe two weeks ago when I was outside on the phone, but I never had a witness to that sighting.  This is the second time I've seen it and I've never seen anything strange in the sky before now.   What's so astounding is how large this white light is in the sky!!! It's way larger than any star in the sky that's visible! It's a HUGE white light?!?!!;37.4149;-76.5441
