Shapedlike pietin Est. diameter (given altitude) maybe 50'.  This was only saucer Ive ever seen in my life, yet 6 days earlier at 09:30 saw white dot in West Sky flying N to S, est.altitude 10,000', traveling Mach 15-20. There was no contrail or noise and far away but very bright.  I assumed it was a meteror judging by its flat trajectory.  However, when I got excellent look at obvious saucer on 2/21 I thought about its relation in timing to news at the time i.e. second major attack on Iraq and wondered if it was military.  It was very clearly circular however and definitly not conventional or even Black Ops.;37.9176;-76.9092
