Disk shaped pinkish purple object high in the sky made no sound seen through camera screen. Photographed.;2007-09-15 14:00:00;3.00min;Disk shaped pinkish purple object high in the sky made no sound seen through camera screen. Photographed. After having completed installing our church flag pole I did a trial run of raising the two flags into place.  I knelt down to take a digital photo of this flag installation. I noticed a pinkish purple colored disk shaped object in the LCD view finder screen but after taking the shot did not see it in the sky as it was close to the bright sun and there was no noise at all.  Upon downloading it to my home computer in order to print the photo for the church newsletter I noticed the purple, pink disc shaped object with a elongated oval shaped pod on its underside, directly above the US flag.  I have zoomed in on this object in the next two enlargements. Just for the record I am 64 years old, hold a commercial pilots license flying since I was 16 years old. Have 20/20 vision wearing glasses. Have been in law enforcement most of my life and have never seen this object before.  I was alone on this sparcly populated area hilltop church parking lot near Norton Virginia that has a ground elevation of 2400 Feet above sea level with a clear sky. GPS coordinates 37. 00' 26 N  082. 39'08W  As a pilot I have come across St Elmo’s fire phenomenon, Bermuda triangles instrument and electronic effects, glowing phosphorous clouds, green glowing sea alge and countless weather happenings but how this reflected light back into my Kodak 6.2 mb camera I can’t explain.
