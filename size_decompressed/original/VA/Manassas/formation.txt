Seen 4 lights, high speed, very high altitudein the Manassas, VA area.;1997-03-24 23:40:00;20-25 secs.;Summary : Seen 4 lights, high speed, very high altitude in the Manassas, VA area. I was outside walking my dog and observing the lunar eclipse around 11:20pm, I had been outside for about 20 minutes.  I was getting cold and it seemed like the eclipse wasn't really getting full, I was getting ready to head in and I noticed a very faint light, like a blur, kind of like when a search light goes across the sky.I looked back up and I seen 4 very soft or faint lights directly overhead and very high up.  I looked up with my binoculars to get a better look and I could see 4 lights, shaped like a triangle with 1 of the lights sort of trailing off the back right one, closer to it than the rest were to each other.  I watched them through thebinoculars for about 10 -15 seconds before they were out of sight.  The whole thing happened in about 20 - 25 seconds.  The lights were very faint sort of a hazy yellow color.  The sky at the time was crystal clear, about 10 minutes before the sighting the last of some clouds had passed by.  In comparison to any airplanes flying aroundtonight these lights were probably 3 or 4 times as high and 10 times faster.  I didn't hear any engines.  The whole thing is a bit of exciting also a bit of alarming, its the first time I've ever seen something in the sky and couldn't figure out what it was.  It might have been military stuff but I don't think so, it was really very fast.I would just like to know what it was, I figure with all the people observing the eclipse tonight someone else should have seen it too.  If this service hears of someone else seeing it please e-mail me and let me know. Thanks.;38.7551561170211;-77.4905670212765
observed a formation of approx fifty craft in upper atmosphere traverse night sky.  formation was traversing sky fromwest to east and h;1997-12-31 20:30:00;30 sec;Summary : observed a formation of approx fifty craft in upper atmosphere traverse night sky.  formation was traversing sky from west to east and had a diamond like formation at it's center. Objects in the formation were oval shaped with slight points at their sides.  All were identical and were a light brown or tan in color. The formation did not break as it traversed across the night sky.  I called Andrews AFB and the SDO gave me the # to the FAA which turned out to be a fax #.  I called Wash-DC info and got the # for the FAA which gave me the # for MUFON.  Very interesting...that the govt. does not want anything to do with UFO's and would rather pass any reports onto a privatley run civilian organization. My fight has only just begun. I will make my sighting known.  I have nothing to lose since I am not a public figure...yet.;38.7551561170211;-77.4905670212765
3 lights hovering in Virginia;2011-12-01 19:45:00;3 minutes;3 lights hovering in Virginia At around 7:45 on December 1, 2011, I went outside my house to get firewood.  I head a noise that sounded similar to a low flying airplane.  It almost sounded like a whale call. I looked up and saw 3 low-flying lights moving very slow.  I turned around and called for the other 2 people inside (my brother and his girlfriend).  They came outside immediately (took about 15 seconds), it was already roughly a half mile away.  It hovered for about a minute and a half before it moved out of site.  In roughly 2 minutes what looked to be several military airplanes headed in the same direction. I called my grandmother at this time and could hear an echo in my phone.  We tried to get on the internet on our phones and it did not work, there has never been an issue getting on the internet in this area before.  We live about a half hour from Dulles Airport, we see airplanes all day, everyday, and this did not look or sound like anything we have ever seen or heard before.;38.7551561170211;-77.4905670212765
