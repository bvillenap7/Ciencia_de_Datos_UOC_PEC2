Strange glow in the sky;2003-05-12 03:30:00;10 Minutes;Strange glow in the sky First off the only rational answer for this I could come up with was that it was the moon with clouds passing over. Anyway, I went outside to smoke and I noticed a bright orange half cirle shape in the distance. It wasent a perfect circle but thats the best way I can describe it. Over the course of me standing there watching this thing it seemed to move and get smaller untill all that was left was a diagonal line with two small circles on each side. The two small circles is the only reason I thought it to be something other than the moon even though it seemed odd as soon as I saw it. THinking it was the moon and clouds had just blocked my veiw I waited to see if it came back and it never did.;38.7551561170211;-77.4905670212765
