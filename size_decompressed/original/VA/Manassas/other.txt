black cube that flashed coded lights;2005-06-17 13:40:00;2-3 minutes;black cube that flashed coded lights Unidentified over Manassas June 17, 2005 1:40 pm EDT  A neighbor first spotted it, thinking it was a bird.  She pointed it out to me.  It appeared to be an all black cube, moving from north to south, just below a layer of cumulus clouds.  It was to the southeast of our site.  The side toward us was pulsing/flashing a code—blink, blink, blink, pause, blink, long pause, then repeated again and again.  It stopped its forward N-S motion, and slowly ascended into a cloud.  At the time there were several planes in the area, and also high flying birds.  It was not one of those.  It was difficult to judge the size of the cube, but I would say it was about the size of an airline fuselage.;38.7551561170211;-77.4905670212765

It had 4 lights -- one mustard-yellow light on each corner. It was dark and I was driving home from work and was almost home when a strange object in the sky dipped down just ahead of my car and then gracefully soared upward and through the tree tops.  As it went through the tree tops in turned sideways at an angle and then straightened out after going through the trees and disappeared behind the trees.  It was the shape of a SQUARE with 4 mustard-yellow lights (one light on each corner) that were very bright.   When I first saw it I was almost to the stop sign near my home so I stopped and watched it until I could no longer see it.  My first reaction was “what the heck is that!”  It was so close to me that it shook me up.  I can’t stop thinking about it.  It’s hard to say how big it actually was, but I can tell you that it looked like at least a 50’ to 60’ square.  I had my car windows down on both sides and even stuck my head out the window and could not hear any sound whatsoever.   It moved so gracefully through the sky. It was a strange sight to see, certainly not the ordinary.;38.7551561170211;-77.4905670212765
