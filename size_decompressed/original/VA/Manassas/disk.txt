The kids flew their kites and many adults also flew kites and we had a nice picnic.  They were giving prizes for the best kite, the highest flying one, etc.  They even had a hot air baloon for the kids.  Anyway, about 5 pm, the announcer told the crowd that one of the kites was caught in a thermal, a hot air convection and was about 800 ft and going up.  So, everyone is looking up and I was eating.  I stopped, looked up and saw some white bugs in front of my eyes, or so I thought!  I refocused and suddenly realized that I was focusing on some silver dots flying about 30,000 ft up.  They were going from east to west directly into the soon to be setting sunlight. I think the sun set at about 6 or so.  Anyway, 2 of the disks suddenly moved quite a bit ahead of the others, which seemed to be swarming.  They then were lost in the sun.  My friend came from the other side of the park, about a mile away and asked, did you see those things flying up there?  He said all the people were really excited about seeing something, but it happened so fast that you didn't realize what you were seeing until you actually thought about it a bit.  They looked EXACTLY like the old movie of the UFOS in Montana in the late forties.  Silver dots and I would say they covered half the sky in 10 seconds.;38.7551561170211;-77.4905670212765
Saucer shaped object stopped then zoomed across sky , possibly landing on near by open field.;2014-09-07 20:10:00;35 minutes;Saucer shaped object stopped then zoomed across sky , possibly landing on near by open field. A disk or saucer shaped object stood high in the sky without moving for about ten minutes . It had one steady dim orangey light. After it stood still for a while , it started to move across the sky very quickly.  It had moved a couple miles towards the right of me and then stopped again.  It began to changed colors and more noticeable.  It had a steady white light on top of what appeared to be a saucer and a red light going around it repeatedly.  Once it's lights changed that's when I begin to notice that this saucer was coming down from the sky and possibly landing in a nearby field .;38.7551561170211;-77.4905670212765

The objects were not making any noise and appeared like silver saucers. The bottom of them seem to be spinning and it look like it had boosters in the rear. Was no smoke or trail behind the object and it seemed to seamlessly move across the sky at a slow to moderate rate. The last one we saw was going in a completely opposite direction the rest of them seem to be going in the general direction of the first one sighted. Birds could be seeing flying away in the opposite direction in large numbers. Entire event started at approximately 1900 hrs. and continue through approximately 1934 hrs. The last object was seen by myself my 10-year-old son and my wife. We took a picture with her cell phGone and when you zoom in it does look like a silver saucer like object still. No define details however. No we are not the type who highly believed in uni! dentified flying object's prior to this event. We also saw a regular plain black in color flying in the same general path as the objects however the objects were not present at this time and had already passed.
