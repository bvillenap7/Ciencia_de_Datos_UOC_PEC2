Object hovering over homes in Manassas, VA.;2014-11-24 18:40:00;90 seconds;Object hovering over homes in Manassas, VA On 24 November 2014, at about 6:40 pm, I was driving southwest on Hastings drive coming from Liberia Avenue.  I stopped at the 4 way stop intersection and noticed three red lights hovering over a section of houses.  The lights were not evenly spaced but from my view it look like the object was triangular shaped.  The lights were solid, not flashing like an aircraft, and it was too big to be a drone.  As I went through the intersection, the object slowly began to move in the direction of Lake Jackson.  So I u-turned and tried to follow it but lost it as the light went past the top of the tree line. My first thought was “what the hell is that?”  It was a dark night, because the moon was crescent, but the sky was clear, no clouds.  It was dark enough that I could not make out the shape of the object but I could tell that it was bigger than the house it was hovering over.;38.7551561170211;-77.4905670212765
