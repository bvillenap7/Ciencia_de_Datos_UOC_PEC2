3 lights in triangle shape or form silently zipps over Manassas, VA;1989-05-15 21:30:00;7-10 seconds;3 lights in triangle shape or form silently zips over Manassas, VA One spring night in 1989 me and three friends of mine were standing outside talking. I wasnt really involved in the conversation and happened to look up. WHen I did I immediatly saw 3 lights in the shape of a triangle moving very fast but didnt make any noise nor did it have any blinking lights. I yelled What is that!!!. At nearly the same time my friend Mark saw it and we both started running after it while pointing up in the sky saying  look! look!.  Some how our other two friends never saw it but I never forgot it. I was 12 years old then and I'm 29 now and have just seen a show on UFO's that included sightings just like mine. I never believed in the ability of a ET to travel the incredible distance to Earth due to the mind boggeling amount of energy needed and time. But after careful research and my own sighting of a UFO I guess I can no longer rule it out.  I am also hoping that maybe someone else in Northern VA may have seen the same thing. If so POST IT!!!! I want to know.  Thanks ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));38.7551561170211;-77.4905670212765
Black Triangle seen low over town of Manassas  ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));2004-12-16 21:50:00;10 Seconds;Black Triangle seen low over town of Manassas I pulled into the parking spot in front of my home and happened to glance upward in time to see a large, black triangle passing over my house.  I could only watch it for around 10 seconds before it passed over.   The aircraft was black or gray, with no lights at all and only visible due to the slight reflection of city lights on the underside. I could just make out circular patterns on the underside of the craft, one large ring or circle in the middle and smaller circles at each corner.  I estimate each of the  three equal sides were around 100 feet in length. The black craft was very low, just over the trees, making no noise that I could hear. The first thing that occured to me when I saw the black triangle was that it was man made, some sort of top secret black stealth.  There are air bases, NASA, Lockheed Martin and government agencies dotted around the Northern Virginia and Washington DC area. I can understand why a black stealth would fly low, to evade radar, but why would a top secret aircraft fly or hover over a city so early in the evening while people are out and about?  This black triangle looks more advanced than any man made aircraft I've seen before, perhaps the fact that it looks alien provides a cover in itself.  How many witnesses of the black triangle would risk telling others about their sighting?  The risk of losing credibility from a black triangle sighting will keep many quiet, others may get labeled as UFO weirdos, perhaps the government is counting on this as part of the Black Stealth's cover.

Huge up close triangular craft.;2013-10-20 21:00:00;1 hour;Huge up close triangular craft I was by taco bell on Liberia avenue on 28 we where sitting in the home depot parking lot eating.  I looked over and saw a huge white light.  I looked at my husband and said hey look at that light in the sky.  We watched it for a while it did nothing.  Then we looked around and all the sudden saw like ten or more flashing red, purple, blue lights all circular.  Then they stopped we looked back at the huge white light a little while later and saw another huge white light coming towards that one.  I said look at that again now there is two.  We where looking at it and it started moving then we started following it in the sky in our car. It slowly hovered back down 28 and right over lomond drive to that seven eleven up the street from guapos.  As we where going down lomond drive we saw it horizontal in the sky.  Then we kept driving down the road and saw it hovering over the seven eleven probably about 200 feet in the air.  We saw a huge triangular craft in the sky with red white and green lights.  Circular and long lights on the under body of the craft.  It looked like a bunch of little fans there was no sound and we saw a little lump at the top.  Like where someone would be flying the craft. Then i was yelling out the window and pointing at it and after i looked at it hovered to the right and then back and back and back we tried to follow it to see where it went but we could not find it.  I think it landed. I am not kidding.  I have never seen anything like this in my entire life my husband has not either. It was not far up in the sky i would say it was a close encounter.  Anyone else who has seen it that night at the seven eleven please post and tell us what you saw.;38.7551561170211;-77.4905670212765
