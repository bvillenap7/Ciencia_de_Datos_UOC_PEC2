Huge glowing green object in Northern VA.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor.  PD));2004-12-11 19:55:00;15 - 20 sec.;Huge glowing green object in Northern VA. I had just picked up my Son from work in Manassas, and we were driving in a Westerly direction, toward home, at approx. 07:55 PM (EST). The night was dark, clear and starry weather...no moon in sight...with some, not many,  scattered clouds. Several, easily visible, and identifiable commercial jet aircraft were inbound to the Dulles Int'l Airport, and were flying their regular approach traffic patterns...of which we are very familiar. Suddenly, we witnessed a growing green glow approaching from the west, and increasingly lighting up major portions of the sky, very bright, almost neon green. Clouds rapidly became brightly backlit, and sillouetted. Then we were stunned to witness a huge, brightly glowing, green object traverse the sky, almost horizontally, from approx. southerly to north / northwest direction. It appeared, at first to only be a few thousand feet in the air...but this was hard to judge....it flew on very rapidly , trailing a sort of vapor in its wake, and then, just as suddenly as it appeared, it suddenly descended to earth, with extreme speed,and this was followed immediately by blackness (darkness). It appeared to us, from our vantage point, to have come down to earth, either crashed, or landed, perhaps within several miles to the west.... We were puzzeled because there was no sound, no sonic boom, no sound of a crash, and no smoke on the horizon... We discussed the incident together, and thought perhaps it was a meteor???, but dismissed that because we had seen several meteor showers before, and they never resembled anything like this object. It was extremely large...glowed very brightly, neon green incolor...had a vapor trail, traveled at extreme speed (at least ten times faster than jets in the air that night), and then suddenly dived, or descended rapidly....and almost certainly landed, or came to earth via a crash...all without a sound. It lit up an enormous portion of the sky..from our vantage point. I am puzzled as to what that was???...and if anyone else in the region,or on board a flight that evening had a glimpse of the same object?

I am not exag;2013-10-04 20:00:00;3 hours;Walked outside before 8 pm and 1st one I saw was white/yellow slowly blinking lights in the sky.  Very Bright, Very close.  I am not exaggerating when I say that there was one in every direction that I was looking at.  Some were the white slowly blinking lights, others were tiny ones off in the distance moving at a rapid speed, and others were flashing red, purple, blue, and white lights, and moving slowly.  I’m talking 10, 20 UFO’s in the sky ALL AT ONCE. I kept thinking, at first, that they were planes, but it’s impossible that so many planes were in the sky all at once, and each plane having different light patterns. The most intriguing ones were the red, purple, blue, and white lights because they were flashing horizontally and the lights were flashing one after the other, so it wasn’t just one big flash.  This was going on everywhere! Everywhere in the sky I then noticed what looked like military aircraft in the sky.  My theory is that if these were in fact alien aircraft the military were trying to divert them and basically “shoo” them away.  OR they were trying to disguise the UFO so that people wouldn’t panic.  This was surreal. I can’t believe what I and so many people in the city of Manassas witnessed. The only reason I am afraid is because I feel that maybe if it was Alien aircraft they were trying to warn us or tell us something OR they were planning an attack.  Either or, Idk, these are just all the thoughts running through my head. I think telling others around would be a bad idea, because they panic so I’ve decided that I would not.  But reporting it here is best, in case someone is trying to investigate. At one point, one aircraft was right on top of the other. I think the one below was military aircraft that was trying to ‘shoo’ away the other UFO right above it.  I know it’s hard to believe, but I’m honestly having a hard time making sense of what happened a few hours ago.  Thank you for your attention.

Moved forward, then stopped and hovered before continuing forward.  Then the light suddenly changed direction then seemed to drop extremely fast then come back up a bit then dropped again this time out of sight for me.

6 red lights near Lake Jackson.;2014-11-27 18:35:00;10 minutes;6 red lights near Lake Jackson. Just reporting that my family and I saw six red lights in the sky flying low and making no noise which we have planes fly over all the time but it being thanksgiving air traffic was non-existent and so we definitely suspect these lights to be UFOs.   The lights did not flash or blink, but were a constant red/orange color.  They also seemed to fly in pairs in a line with the last two side by side.  They flew over our street Margarite towards Lake Jackson and furthermore towards Quantico.;38.7551561170211;-77.4905670212765
UFOs in Manassas, VA!!!;2018-03-11 00:30:00;45 minutes;UFOs in Manassas, VA!!! I was outside smoking a ciggrett, looking at the stars, and noticed a weird looking one.  I stared at it for a few minuets then saw other lights on it and figured it was a airplane,  i live near the flight path of Dulles Airpor, but it seem to hover in the same spot for a while.  It was just a ball of light with a flashing light on it.  It started to move a little bit when an airplane started going towards it, but still stayed where i could see it.   Then i saw what looked like a shooting star pass by it, and another one appeared a few feet away from the other one.  The second one looked like a red star and moved the same way as the other, they both just hovered for a while,  i went inside to get a camara but when i came back out they were gone.  I've always been skeptical but now I'm a Believer!!!! ((NUFORC Note:  In a telephoned message, the source of the report assures us that the report is an accurate representation of the facts.

3:15 A.M. Bright Sphere in NW sky between Elnath (Taurus) & Capella zipping around in erratic pattern. High altitude.;2019-12-25 03:15:00;10+ minutes;3:15 A.M. Bright Sphere in NW sky between Elnath (Taurus) & Capella zipping around in erratic pattern.  High altitude. I took my dog outside at 3 am so she could do her business. It was a clear crisp night, with little cloud cover, so I was admiring the beautiful stars in the night sky.  No moon was visible at the time. I looked to the NW at Capella which was very clear & bright.  Then I looked towards Elnath in the Taurus constellation, which was also clearly visible with the naked eye.  Between these two stars were a few fainter stars,Kabdalinan &  Mahasim, and then I saw movement. In between Elnath & Capella  where no visible stars were, an object was zipping around in an erratic manner.  Sharp 90 degree turns right, left, up, down & then diagonally.  No dissernable path or logic  was evident in it's flight pattern & no great distance was covered. It would move a couple of inches left then up a couple then back.  It was extremely high up, but was not moving between the stars, more like it was searching the area for something.  I heard no sound, & there were no airplanes or helicopters in the sky at that time of the morning.  Stars don't move in different directions & back & forth. I got my binoculars out to make sure I was seeing this thing move & sure enough it was still zipping in every direction.  I watched it for a good 10 - 15 min. totally amazed at the manuverability of this object  I've lived near numerous airports & military bases & have never seen any air craft with this capability. I ended up leaving the binoculars out, so that I would remember this event in the morning. Even as I was doing so, I was trying to convince myself it was a dream. But I figured if they were left out & not put away then they would remind me of the encounter in the morning. No binoculars - it was a dream. Binoculars left out... It really happened. Low & behold they were there in the morning. I shared my experience with my pilot husband & daughter, & we joked it was Santa delivering toys, but if it was he has whiplash because those stop on a dime & change direction moves couldn't be ensured by humans. I just went out at 3:30 this morning 12/26/2019 to check the same spot. Same clear crisp weather, no star or object is visible in that part of the sky.;38.7551561170211;-77.4905670212765
