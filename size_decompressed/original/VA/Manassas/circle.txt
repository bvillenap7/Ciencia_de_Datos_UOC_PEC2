sitting outside, saw bright light in sky, traveling at a high speed.;1999-09-22 00:20:00;30-40 seconds;sitting outside, saw bright light in sky, traveling at a high speed. My friend and I were sitting outside of the plant we work at.  I happened to look up at the sky and saw a bright orange ball (almost like a ball of fire in the sky) travelling at a high rate of speed.  I pointed it out to my friend.  At first we thought it was a comet, (but it didn't have a tail), then we thought it might be a meteor or a shooting star.  However it was neither.  We watched it coming down toward earth at like a 45 degree angle, then it abruptly started falling straight toward the ground.  Thats when we saw it like transform into like a triangle and had bright lights that lit up on the bottom of it which we think might of been thrusters.  The lights were really bright, then this object shot into the sky and dissapeared completely.  This all happened in approximately 30-40 seconds.  As close as it was to us, had it of been any kind of aircraft, we would have heard something.  As it is it was completely silent.  It was also a cloudy and semi stormy night, and it was traveling under the clouds, and even though the actual object was bright, no light reflected off the clouds.;38.7551561170211;-77.4905670212765
I looked up and saw what looked like a column of discs flying silently in formation as I arrived home around 10:pm 12/21/03.;2003-12-21 22:30:00;1-3 minutes;I looked up and saw what looked like a column of discs flying silently in formation as I arrived home around 10:pm 12/21/03. I was arriveing home around 10:30pm from playing a gig at a christmas party when, as I'm walking toward my house from the car, I glance up to look at the stars because it was such clear sky, and I think I see something like three or four falling stars at once. As I start to look down again I do a double take and they're still there. I see these gray circle shaped objects moving across the sky from south west to north east approximately. They were completely silent from my perspective. They seemed maybe three times the diameter of Jupitor but not as bright. I'm not sure but they seemed to be in rows of 6-9 across moving in a column. Their speed was about the speed of a passenger jet comming in for a landing at Dulles Airport. I happen to live under flight path to and from Dulles. These craft, or whatever they were, seemed to follow that flight path. I have no idea what their altitude was. If I were to guess I would say maybe seven or eight thousand feet. I can't be sure though. To give you some idea of what it looked like to me, the first impression I had was that of a planetarium moving the lights across the sky. Eccept the circles positions relative to each other were not stationary. They sort of floated very slightly in relation to each other as they moved across the sky. I can't say how many because the column was there when I looked up. From what I saw it could have been anywhere for 15-1500. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness observed.  The report does not seem to us consistent with an observation of a flock of migratory birds.  PD));38.7551561170211;-77.4905670212765

Two sets of three were in v formation It was dark and I was on my way home from work and driving on a busy road through a residential area when I saw off to my right ahead of me there were a number of large round mustard-yellow lights (approximately 10 to 15) in the sky that were simply hovering and not going anywhere.  Each one appeared to have one round yellow light (without a beam) that I could see, and I could not hear any sound. Two sets of three lights were in a “V” formation.  I saw the two “V” formations slightly move once for each of them.  The two “V” formations were parallel and the others were spaced around and between them in a general congregated area.  These lights were not like airplane lights.  The lights stayed consistent without any flashing, blinking, color change, beam or any change at all. These lights appeared larger than the lights we normally see in the sky on regular airplanes and jets when flying at the same level.  These lights were not at a high altitude, but not close enough to see other details in the dark.  This sighting was over a busy, small city and I could not tell if they were positioned over the business or residential district. I did not see any other aircraft in the sky at that location. It was not raining and there was nothing obstructing my vision until they were hidden by trees as I passed by in my car.   I do not have a camera phone so I was not able to take pictures.;38.7551561170211;-77.4905670212765
