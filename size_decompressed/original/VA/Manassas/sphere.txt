(i am a mechanic for a major airline and work at dulles. i live 17 miles from the airport and am located at the southern approach to dulles).i then noticed that the light had dissapeared. then about 30 seconds later the reapeared again in the same spot. i then ran in to get my video camera and started taping the event.the craft just hovered very low and in the same spot for a time. i zoomed in on the object and i could see that it was not totally spherical. i could see that the top had a w shape to and the bottom had a triangle shape to it. i continued to tape the craft and noticed small jet aircraft circling the object. they were not commercial airliners on approach for sure. the object seemed to be moving awat from me but it never lost altitude from my position. during all the taping the craft dissapeared and reapeared about 3 times and never moved.the jet aircraft kept circling this for the whole time. the craft finally dissapeared and i never saw it again for the rest of the night.;38.7551561170211;-77.4905670212765
I observed a bright blue soccer ball size object travel at high speed just above the tree tops.;2005-03-01 22:30:00;2 seconds;I observed a bright blue soccer ball size object travel at high speed just above the tree tops. While standing on the back porch of my town home, I observed a bright blue sphere about the size of a soccer ball that I perceived to be about 100 to 200 feet above the ground. It is possible that because of the night sky and the brightness of the object that is bigger and higher than my perception.  I was struck by how perfectly round the object was. It was a self illuminatined ball bright blue in color traveling northwest directly accross the roof of the town home beside me. It was a clear night and I by shear chance I was looking directly at the spot where the object appeared or I might not have seen it at all.  The speed it hard to guess but the object was visible for no more than a second or two and disappeared beyond the houses a few hundred yards away. There was no sound at all.  I was an air traffic controller earlier in my life and have seen lights appear to be many things they were not. The clarity, brightness, and speed of this object is something I have never encounted before. (NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD));38.7551561170211;-77.4905670212765

Spherical white blinking object floats acrossed the street the darts off as a car was about to hit it.;2013-09-21 17:20:00;10 seconds;spherical white blinking object floats acrossed the street the darts off as a car was about to hit it. Weather conditions: cloudy, roads were damp from recent shower. As my 13 year old son and I had just turned onto our street, we both witnessed a ball of light that seemed to have a strobing light inside that rotated in a clockwise direction with other random blinking white light.  The ball was drifting roughly 12-18 above the street and was approximately 20-24 in diameter.   When I first noticed it, it was on the left side of the street heading towards the right side of the road at a steady 2 feet per second.  As it was about halfway across the oncoming lane a car came up a hill behind it and the ball appeared to rapidly speed out of the way of the car and in front of my truck then off the shoulder still floating at the same height above the ground.  As it left the road, it was going so fast I couldn't track it or figure out where it went because it passed through heavy thickets and saplings.   I thought I was seeing things until my son looked at me with his mouth hanging open and he asked if I saw that.  I asked him what exactly he saw and he described the sighting exactly as I saw it. I was never so happy to hear him say that, I was about to think I was seeing things.;38.7551561170211;-77.4905670212765

At least 100 satelite like lites moving across the sky.  ((anonymous report));2017-09-23 23:45:00;2 minutes;At least 100 satelite like lites moving across the sky My daughter was on the back deck smoking when she called my wife and I to come look.  There were at least 100 orbs moving across the sky with the same trajectory, from NE to SW.  If it was just one I would say it was a satellite but there were so many.
