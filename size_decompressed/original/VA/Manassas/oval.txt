There were four adults and one 7 yr old child there that evening. All are credible individuals, 2 local city gov't employees and a mechanic and an office accountant. What had appeared in the Southern sky that looked like a large group of illuminated balloons, was coming North in our direction. When IT was much closer than at first site, we could see a large golden glowing ball about the size of the face of the moon. It was hazy and seemed to have some object in the glowing round haze, but you could not make out what was inside the haze. Just in front of the glowing Ball, was about four, maybe five, tiny star-like objects.  They seemed to be in a formation just in front of the larger object. All stayed exactly in their formation and made over our heads in Northerly direction, never changing or blinking and never with any sound whatsoever. The tiny starlike objects seemed to be taking or leading the larger object away. They traveled at a high speed and moved out of our view over the house. We all agreed that we could not identify the object as OUR aircraft nor could we think of anything it could have been, other than a UFO.;38.7551561170211;-77.4905670212765
Silent oval/circular/disc semi-transpernt hovering object.;2002-10-20 17:31:00;30;Silent oval/circular/disc semi-transpernt hovering object. On the day of Sunday, October 20th, 2002, @ 5:31pm EDT in Manassas, VA, (about 35 miles WSW of Washington, DC), when  I saw what appeared to be a balloon in the eastern sky heading over the trees to the SW.  My 22 month old son can be heard in the background.  I used my Sony 360X to record this 30 second clip.  I also had the film stopped (later) at .07 second intervals and will send some of those still shots. One of the interesting things about the timing of the event is that it was during time the snipers were running around the greater DC area, shooting people at random, including a shooting in Manassas, only a few days earlier.  Also, this was on the heels of the 2001 attacks on the Pentagon so for two autumns in a row people were on edge and were hunkering down.  Hardly anyone was out and about and I was flabbergasted as to why someone would throw a birthday party (where I thought the balloon was coming from) knowing that they (the snipers) were targeting children as well.  After forgetting about this for nearly a decade, I dug out my HI-8 take from this time frame and decided to take a second look. I looked back and the weather for that day and temperatures were in the 60s with a light wind and  it didnâ€™t look like any atmospheric phenomena or temperature inversions were in the area.  It was completely silent and I lost it behind the trees.  If you slow the film down, it looks like a football inside a gyroscope trying to right itself for a possible take off.  To me, it looked/acted like a plasma.  If you see some of the files in succession, the leaves on the trees are effected as if there were some kind of ionizing radiation or magnetic field was being given off. As I mentioned in a previous report, I worked on NASA contracts and possess a BA in Physics with a Graduate Certificate in Space Operation. I currently teach Physics in another state (my family and I were living in Virginia at the time).;38.7551561170211;-77.4905670212765
At least 50 bright objects flying across the sky.;2013-03-23 20:30:00;40;At least 50 bright objects flying across the sky.   Appeared to be in formations but then it could have been random.   They came up from the horizon and flew accross the manassas sky.  It was truely amazing.  It if was a meteor shower it was the most amazing one on record.

A single black oval with moving frills;2015-09-12 00:00:00;2 to  3 minutes;A single black oval with moving frills In Manassas, Virginia during the month of  September in ,2015. In the afternoon , My wife and I were seated in my car preparing to leave the parking lot of the Global Market on Sudley Road.  When our attention was drawn to an black colored oval shaped object passing  slowly overhead from east to west.  Our initial thought was that it was a balloon. I kept our car in park and took out a pair of 8 - power binoculars, that  I keep for birdwatching and viewed the object.  Through the binoculars,  it was definitely not a balloon. Approximately  two feet in diameter, completely black in color, with a sheen , like that of crude oil. It was moving smoothly , on a string straight trajectory unaffected by  a side wind. Emerging from and passing down equidistantly along either side of this object were frills , also of the same black color and texture. These frills emerged from and appeared to be reabsorbed into the object in a rythmic pattern. Aside from these frills, the object was  featureless. When it reached a bare tree within a yard , across Sudley Road, it stopped in mid- air. At that point I attempted to drive to the adjacent mall to get closer look at it , though it was gone, by the time we reached the mall.  No sound was noted. I have included a sketch.;38.7551561170211;-77.4905670212765
