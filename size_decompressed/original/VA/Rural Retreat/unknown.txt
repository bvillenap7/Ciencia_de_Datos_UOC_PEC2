Star like lights, stationary, but occasional red light flashing from them, on the East sides of the lights.;2020-11-02 20:40:00;Still going on;Star like lights, stationary, but occasional red light flashing from them, on the East sides of the lights. I live in Rural Retreat, VA.  I have been seeing a light I first thought was a plane, for it has occasional quick blink of red light.  It does not move though.  On the compass on my phone, it is at 210 degrees, ssw.  My husband has been watching it also.  Then noticed another light, blinking once, red, every little bit.  Perhaps 10 seconds apart.  It is at 120 degrees eew.  We have been watching for about 15 minutes.  Sometimes it seems like it would move a bit to the left of right, then maintain that position, or go back to first one.  They look a lot like stars, but for the red blinking lights.  The red lights seem to be on the south (L) side of the the light.  The lights are brighter than the few stars I can see.  They are also lower a little in the sky.  I We opened a window to see if we could hear anything, like noise from a plane, But there was no sounds but for distant traffic on I-81, which is usual for us.;36.8815;-81.2857
