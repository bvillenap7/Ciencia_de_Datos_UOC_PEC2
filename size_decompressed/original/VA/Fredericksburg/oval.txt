The lights went out and there seemed to be a light colored residue in the sky. Hard to explain but looked like a combustion cloud, but it a a faint glow.   Wife came out and took pictures.  The owls were freaking out and getting loud which brought me outside to witness this event.  The craft made no sound. ((NUFORC Note:  Rocket launch from Wallops Island.
