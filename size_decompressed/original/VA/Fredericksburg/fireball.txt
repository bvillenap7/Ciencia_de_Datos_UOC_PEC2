2 round, orange lights appear, then dim out.  ((anonymous report));2018-08-01 21:00:00;2-3 minutes;2 round, orange lights appear, then dim out I was driving from Culpeper, heading towards Fredericksburg, when a red lightning appeared.  I thought that it might have been Mars since it was supposed to be really close to Earth the previous day, but the light slowly dimmed out completely.  Then 3 minutes later, its appears again, but this time a second one appears & after a minute of watching in disbelieve, both from brighter then dim out until they both disappear.
