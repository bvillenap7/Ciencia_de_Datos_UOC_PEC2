Cruising over I-95N exit 126.  We glanced over the Fredericksburg city area and we saw this enormous flashing green, blue, and yellow light.  It was over Rt1.  There is no way we were the only one to see this. If the Northern Lights could flash with many shades of yellow in it and some blue, that was it.  We didn't spot an aircraft of some sorts due to traffic picking up and our main concentration was driving safely.;38.2973796178344;-77.4933656050955
