Bright orange object in the night sky over Fredericksburg, VA.;2013-12-25 16:25:00;2 minutes;Bright orange object in the night sky over Fredericksburg, VA Observed egg shaped object glowing reddish orange that at first was thought to be a burning meteor.  It slowed down to nearly a complete stop.  No sound to be heard.  The center and edges seemed to rotate and vibrate and the light shined like a star.  After a brief pause it accelerated and was out of sight within seconds.  Watched the object from my back porch while letting my dog out for a few minutes.  Object was no more than a thousand feet away flying incredibly low before completely vanishing after an incredible burst of speed.
