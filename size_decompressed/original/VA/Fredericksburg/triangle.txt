shot upwards after emiting a strange beam;2011-03-18 19:00:00;2 minutes;shot upwards after emiting a strange beam Left a friends house to walk to another residence about a mile down the way, the sky was littered with thunderclouds as earlier the day it stormed heavily, the storm itself was slowly shifting with the winds as if it was preparing itself for another rain.  About 60 yards from the house we left, 4 of us in total, noticed a formation of lights and at first just figured it was a passing plane.  However we then noticed it was flying beneath the storm and at a very slow speeds, as if it was gliding, and the closer we walked we also noticed no sound.  Talking to each other, we joked about how the object is an alien and a friend then blurted out. Don't juuuuuuuuuuudge me.  As if on que, the object actually stopped which caused the 4 of us to stop and watch, the object then shot out then beam of light that moved at least 90', you could see the light actually reflecting off the clouds, the beam shot upwards then went off.  Right after the object then shot itself upwards! at unknown speeds, fast enough to have myself and the 3 others basically shit out pants.  From what it seemed, the object was hiding between the clouds for as we stood there trying to recollect what just occurred, a passenger plane then flew by above the storm, this time its engines clearly audible for a group of people enjoying a walk in the sleeping suburbs of Fredericksburg.;38.2973796178344;-77.4933656050955
Monday, October 03, 2011 Time:  Approximately 10:30 pm EST.;2011-10-03 22:30:00;3 - 5 minutes;Monday, October 03, 2011 Time:  Approximately 10:30 pm EST. Place:  Fredericksburg, VA  Sighting Report:  This evening at approximately 10:30 pm eastern standard time, my wife and daughter were driving home heading west.  Near our neighborhood, they spotted a large aircraft hovering above the road.  They said as they approached it, the craft did not move.  It was hovering in one place. As they drew closer, they lost sight of the craft as their car drove under it. My daughter turned back and could still see it hovering behind the car through the back window. They both described the craft as a distinct boomerang shape with a single, very large white light at the end of the two boomerang arms and a smaller yellow light at the tip of the “v”.   My wife said that it appeared to be the size similar to two large passenger jets hovering side by side. They did not stop, as there was no place to pull the vehicle over.  When they saw the craft, they were about a ½ mile from our home.  They pulled into our neighborhood and my daughter lost sight of it due to traveling down hill.  The trees blocked their view.  They phoned me as they were looking at it and I went outside with a video camera but was unable to see anything in the sky. Here is an illustration based on their description:;38.2973796178344;-77.4933656050955
Orange/red blurred lights in the shape of a triangle moving across the sky then disappeared.;2012-11-11 21:00:00;30 seconds;Orange/red blurred lights in the shape of a triangle moving across the sky then disappeared. We were walking our dog and I noticed three blurred orange/red lights in a triangle shape moving across the sky at a moderate pace and then it slowly disappeared.  There was no sound and it lasted about 30 seconds.  This is not the first time I've seen something like this.;38.2973796178344;-77.4933656050955

Lower than a plane but higher than a cell phone tower. The lights weren’t moving. I asked my mom, what is that? She thought it was a tower until we got closer and we saw it was a craft of some sort. It was hovering and was a triangle shape- not a perfect triangle- it had a point but the base was not a straight line. It had multiple circle lights on the bottom of the craft - extremely bright white lights. It didn’t move at all. I wanted to keep looking at it but since I was on the highway, I had to keep moving.;38.2973796178344;-77.4933656050955
