From where i was sitting the meteors were striking from left to right (I don't know if it makes a difference). Anyway, from the right of the sky appeared an object (it looked like two diamonds a little off-centered) comming from right to left at about half to 3/4 the speed of the meteors. After it reached about 1/2 the way across the sky it split into 2 objects, they stayed at an equal distance from each other and continued across the sky. Ok...now i know some might say it was probably a meteor. But this had no trail, you could distinctly see that it was 2 diamond like objects. ((NUFORC Note:  If it was Sunday morning on the day of the Leonid meteor shower, the date would have been November 18.  We have amended the date here.  PD));38.2973796178344;-77.4933656050955
