Large wingless aircraft;2011-07-23 16:00:00;30 seconds;Large wingless aircraft My wife and I heard what sounded like a sonic boom.  Seconds later, we saw a very large craft that was traveling in a straight line northeast toward Washington D.C..   It was faster than a conventional airliner but not as fast as a jet fighter.  It was white but had a silver belly.  It looked just like a C-130, BUT clearly DID NOT have wings!  Like a C-130, the fuselage was wide, and appeared to ramp to the rear, but there were no tail fins.  On the belly were two dark grey circles side by side, easily seen as they contrasted from the silver belly.  There were two large cylindrical shapes, one on each side as if there were was a jet engine mounted directly to the fuselage on each side. We could see the craft very clearly.  We did not see windows, not even in the front cockpit area.  There were no markings anywhere.  No contrails.   My first thought was that it looked man-made but we saw it from the side and as it was flying away at an angle....we are convinced that there absolutely no wings on this enormous aircraft.   Unfortunately we were in a pool so we did not have a camera.  However, I could draw it or give a very accurate description to an artist.;38.2973796178344;-77.4933656050955
