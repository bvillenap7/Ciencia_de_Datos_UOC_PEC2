For the first 5 minutes we were driving and all that was seen was an orange light that got very bright, then grew extremely dim, then bright again, then dim.   We parked the car and got out to see it better and it got bright and then grew dim one last time.  It was low enough we could see the outline of this circular craft with no light for just a second.   Then saw small lights start to appear around the outer rim.   It stayed quite close and above us for about another minute before slowly flying away.;38.2973796178344;-77.4933656050955

It came across from the right of me and my son.   It flashed a red light then flashed a second red light and then flew up and was gone.   It was close to trees and I could see it over tree tops at my home.;38.2973796178344;-77.4933656050955

Intially the lights were bright read and what appeared to be flashing white light to the right of it.  Once outside the lights went from red to green then stayed that way for a minute.  Initial thoughts were a hovering helicopter.   Suddenly the lights went back to red then it moved very fast to the left and down, disappearing out of sight.  The fast and curvy flight path downwards is something not commonly seen in helicopters or airplanes.;38.2973796178344;-77.4933656050955
Large group of small circular objects;2021-05-01 18:00:00;5 minutes;Large group of small circular objects The sky was bright blue and clear. As I was preparing an outdoor fire for myself and my 2 kids, I noticed a plane flying off to my east. This is extremely common, as we live in the flight path for DCA. However, beyond the aircraft, at an extremely high altitude was several (12-20) white circular objects all moving together going from south to north just as the plane was traveling. At first, I didnâ€™t think much of it but as I was getting the firewood ready I began to think: this is extremely odd. So, I said to my kids: look at this guys, dad has never seen anything like this. My six year old observed the objects too and we were both puzzled by the I thought maybe they could be weather balloons but I do not believe they are released in such a large number. I tried to take a picture but my iPhone would not zoom that far, these objects were hard to see with the naked eye.;38.2973796178344;-77.4933656050955
