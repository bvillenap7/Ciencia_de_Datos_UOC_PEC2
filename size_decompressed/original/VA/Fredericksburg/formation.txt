The three stars then rapidly descended and moved to my left, where I saw a red object behind them. The objects passed above the highway medium on my left hand side, where I saw the three stars (now cigar shaped) were more golden shape. The single red object pursuing them became three red objects. I could only make out one of their shapes (triangle). At the time I was driving from DC to Richmond, where this occurred on the highway leading to the exit to Fredericksburg.;38.2973796178344;-77.4933656050955
