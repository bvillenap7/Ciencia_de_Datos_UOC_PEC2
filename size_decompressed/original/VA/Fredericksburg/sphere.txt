My view of the sky was unblocked 240Â°.  When I first saw it, my first thought was I have never seen anything like it before.  Then I realized it was hovering.

They were followed immediately by a pursuing aircraft with familiar, man-made looking navigation lights.  This all took about four seconds.  I never heard a sound from any of the lights' sources.;38.2973796178344;-77.4933656050955
