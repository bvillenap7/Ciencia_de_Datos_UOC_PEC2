High speed.;2008-02-21 09:45:00;10 minutes;Square object with 5 lights-silent, flies 50 feet above the ground. Sharp 90 degree turns. High speed. Driving home I saw 5 lights in a line floating below the tree line so i stopped at a stop sign for about 2 mins and put my windows/sun roof down and turned radio off to listen for it. There were no other cars around and it suddenly flew directly over my car about 50 feet off the ground.  I saw through my sunroof that it was a perfect square with 5 white lights and a red light.  I then sped home to tell my two friends about it and within 5 minutes we retraced my route to find it. About 2 miles away from my house the three of us spotted it about 3 miles away infront of us.  We continued to follow as best as we could so that we were less than a quarter mile behind it.  It was flying parallel to the road we were on and it suddenly took a 90 degree turn left at a very high speed and continued in that direction.  We tried to follow it with the accessible roads and finally lost it while we were on a back heavily wooded road about 6 or 7 miles from my house.  We then turned around to go home when we spotted it about 200 yards to our left off the road.  Going about 40 mph it followed our path and suddenly turned completely upright so that the 5 white lights were in a vertical line.  It appeared to be speeding towards our car behind us when, as it was speeding it seemed to be diving down and back up.  After pulling over we lost the craft in the woods so we drove slowly home and did not see it again.  When the craft first flew over me when i was alone it made no sounds at all and was shaped like a perfect square.
