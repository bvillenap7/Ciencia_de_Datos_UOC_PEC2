bright object high in the sky, rotates and hovers constantly. almost like an insect.;2008-01-24 21:00:00;constant;bright object high in the sky, rotates and hovers constantly. almost like an insect. I've seen this object or craft many times throughout the years in 3 different locations where I've lived in Fredericksburg. Object appears high in the sky, appearing higher than most planes fly and definitely higher than any helicopter. (and moving FAR differently than those crafts.)  At a glance it appears to be just another star but if you set your eyes on it, you begin to notice movements not unlike that of an insect of some sort. It will start in one spot, hover around in circular motions and end up back in its original spot.  Although I've seen this object many times, tonight is the first night that I've noticed the lights. I always thought it was just putting off one beam that stayed in place but tonight I can see that the lights seem to be rotating around the object.  Very bright like the light from a large star but definitely not a star. I dont know anything about weather balloons or satelites but I dont think they operate like this. I just want to know if anyone else in the area has seen this.  The last thing I'd like to say is... a few years ago, I was living with my parents and saw this object (or one like it)early in the morning, about 2am. My dog began barking loudly and fiercely soon after I spotted it. Not barking at the object but something off in the woods almost directly under where the object was located. Needless to say, I was alarmed quite a bit. Soon after, he got worse.. howling and I looked in the direction he was barking and saw, from what I could tell, was a man running in some sort of metal armor but was so quick that he was gone within seconds.  About 3 days later, I got home and my dog had broken his chain and was gone from sight and didnt return. The next day, I went riding around to look to see if he had been hit by a car on the main road. Sure enough, it appeared he had been hit. The strange thing though is that, any time previously when he had gotten loose, he NEVER strayed nearly as far as where I found him. Maybe I'm just paranoid but my instinct told me that the night with the object and the barking had something to do with it.  So maybe i'm just paranoid but I'd love to hear from some other Virginia people about this. Thank you.;38.2973796178344;-77.4933656050955
Four or five lights appearing to emanate from the  clouds in the southwest sky;2009-02-27 21:00:00;5 minutes;Four or five lights appearing to emanate from the  clouds in the southwest sky At about 9:00 p.m. this evening I was taking my two dogs out for a walk.  The sky was cloudy and the wind was blowing at about 10 to 15 mph.   I looked up and noticed four or five white lights in the clouds making wide circles (in the south west sky).  At first I thought it might be a search light (and it could have been) but I also noticed that the lights were moving slowly west.  They would make wide circles, then join in the middle, separate and continue making wide circles.   I watched for about two or three minutes, then noticed that they changed from clockwise to counter clockwise orbits. They gradually stopped, one at a time.  From the time I began observing them to the time they fades was about 5 minutes.   The shift westward from the time I began observing them to the time they faded was about 20 degrees.  I am reporting this because I could not discern any beam of light coming from the ground.   It looked like the lights were embedded in/emanating from the clouds.   I called for my 16 year old daughter and she also witnessed the lights.;38.2973796178344;-77.4933656050955
way to big to be a chopper ,about 1000 yds away,twice as high as the trees,we all saw it;2011-04-22 08:45:00;2min;way to big to be a chopper ,about 1000 yds away,twice as high as the trees,we all saw it I saw about 4 lights from left to right  double height of tree top with no movement a little less than half a football field wide.  No sound.  However I was driving. I said to my wife and kids , what the heck is that ? Do you see that? They all saw it . It was not moving. I said open the window, see if you can hear it . We could not.   We went down the street about five hundred yards and turned into the driveway and it was gone.  I looked for about 3 to 5 more minutes and gave up.

Line Moving in Front of Ring Around Moon.;2013-02-20 22:30:00;5 minutes;Line Moving in Front of Ring Around Moon Large ring around moon (not ice crystals for bad weather...I've familiar with this effect) ring was lighter than sky but easy to distinguish.  It was thick and appeared to be a perfect circle.  Moon looked 75%(?).  A long, slim line (best I can describe it) moved from west to east sideways (width wise, not length wise like a snake).  No sound.  Not a craft per say but definitely unidentified.  Line passed in front of moon.  Took up most of sky. Never seen anything like it.   Other people at work saw this as well.
