2 craft visable.;2009-05-21 11:40:00;2 minutes;2 craft visable. Looking north I noticed 2 craft at least 10-15 miles away with no visable trail and moving east very slowly.  There were other aircraft in that area leaving a trail.  Too far away to hear anything.  I was just wondering if there any other reports coming out of this area.  Looked like craft could have been close to Washington DC.  Thanks.;38.2973796178344;-77.4933656050955
Saucer like object with strobbing lights and lighted figures seen roaming within Fredericksburg Forest trail;2017-02-09 03:20:00;4.5 minutes;Saucer like object with strobbing lights and lighted figures seen roaming within Fredericksburg Forest trail On 2/09/2017 I was awakened by a loud sound at approx. 3:15 in the morning.  The sound appeared hollow and metalic in nature.  It sounded as if air was being blown  through a large hollow metal tube. I ran to look out my window in the direction of the sound.  My window faces the forest.  I was shocked to see an illuminated rectangular shaped object, the top area of this standing rectangular object was arched (almost like a boxed shape of a man) It moved amongst the trees and from time to time the light would go out.  I watched in amazement for what seemed like 3 minutes.  There was also another object about 20' away from this object.  It was Saucer-shaped and had 3 strobing lights around it.  It appeared to Hoover about 15' from the ground.  I wanted to capture the images of what I was seeing so I ran and got my cell phone and began recording what I saw.  I recorded the 2 objects and the sound that I heard that woke me up.  My footage is 1 minute 23 seconds long.  I stopped recording when the saucer like object flew off in the distance.

More than 10 triangular desk like objects flying low and blinking red and white lights.  Often giving off a brighter light for a long periods of time, and then blinking.  A brighter white light appeared masking the entire shape of one of the saucers.  Two of them were hovering in place momentarily before taking off in the same direction followed by eight more.  This was on Courthouse Road and Levels Road.;38.2973796178344;-77.4933656050955
