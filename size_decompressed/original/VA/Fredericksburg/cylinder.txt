On December 28th 2016 around 9:00 p.m. I let my dog out to go to the bathroom and when I looked up at the sky I saw approximately between 70 to 100 cylindrical shaped objects in the sky.  They were everywhere when I looked up.  They were all above and around me in the sky at a high altitude as I couldn't really make out the shape and am describing them by the lights I saw.   They made no sound and were pretty high up because several commercial planes flew by and they were well below the lights I was looking at. Each object had 4 white lights along the side and then it had a green blinking light above it and a red blinking light below it.  They were stationary, just hovering there. I grabbed my binoculars and looked at them but couldn’t see any defined edges, only the lights described above.  They were not planes or helicopters or blimps as there wasn’t any sound.  I continued to watch them for about 15 minutes and they did not move with the exception of 2 of them moving and traveling east but they were not moving very fast.  Have looked at news articles in the news paper the following day and nothing was reported. Even my dog was looking up at them which I found strange.  Wondering if anyone else has reported seeing these that same evening?;38.2973796178344;-77.4933656050955
