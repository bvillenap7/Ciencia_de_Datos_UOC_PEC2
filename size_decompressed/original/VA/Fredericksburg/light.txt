Greenish glowing ball seen decending in the sky over Fredericksburg;2004-02-08 00:49:00;a couple of seconds;Greenish glowing ball seen decending in the sky over Fredericksburg Me and my husband were standing on the blacony of our second floor apt. in Fredericksburg we live near the armory. We saw something not really sure of the shape. we were amazed because we have not seen anything falling from the sky with this stange greenish glow. There wasn't a sound it looked like it was falling in slow motion,toward the Alum Springs Park. The sky is clear and you can see the stars fine. What ever this was did not look like any shooting star i have ever seen. I hope we were not the only ones to have caught a glimpse of this.;38.2973796178344;-77.4933656050955

Shining Object Decends On Community;2007-06-04 02:00:00;unsure;Shining Object Decends On Community I'm a 27 year old man who works for the federal government as a management analyst. I raise my daughter full time. On June 4, 2007 at 2 am an illuminated object appeared behind Breezewood Forest in Fredericksburg VA. The object hovered and the intensity of the light it projected increased and decreased periodically.  There was no sound there were no erratic movements but eventually the object moved to the point where I couldn't see it directly from out of my window.  The interesting thing was you couldn't gauge the distance it was from the ground.  It appeared to want to travel unoticed.  It could have easily been mistaken for a star or the moon. Stars don't move and the moon doesn't move in an hour.  A helicopter cannot hover silently.   I regret the fact I didn't get a picture but I was concerned for my safety.;38.2973796178344;-77.4933656050955

Bright light seen in Fredericksburg, Virginia!;2013-09-14 21:00:00;entire evening;Bright light seen in Fredericksburg, Virginia! On a very clear night, with no cloud cover, there appeared a bright light in the sky, brighter than any star and stationary.  There was no apparent movement.  My wife stated she has seen it for 2 nights prior to my sighting, in the same area.  As of this evening, the 15th, it is gone.   Can't really explain it, just there...then gone!   Has anyone else seen this object in the area of Fredericksburg, Virginia... just west of the horizon?;38.2973796178344;-77.4933656050955
The light was moving too fast and suddenly stopped turned red and fell out of the sky then shot straight up..;2015-05-02 01:30:00;20 minutes;The light was moving too fast and suddenly stopped turned red and fell out of the sky then shot straight up.. I was laying in bed with the window open.  My bed faces the window.  Suddenly I see what appears to be a blue green light streaking accross the sky, that I took to be a meteor at first, but it didn't have that tell tale fireball stream following it.  I have absolutely no idea why I jumped up out of my bed, or what made me decide to get up.  Perhaps it was the fact that it had absolutely no sound or that it was too strong of a light that seemed too uniform.  I jumped out of bed and I rush to the window, and right above forested area about 2 miles away from my apt the light just stopped and hovered there for a second, and then it just quickly reversed course and just turned bright red and stopped again.  It was far too fast for anything I've seen man made.  Then it turned blue and sort of dipped and dropped straight down.  It wasnt falling at all.  It looked like it was propelled falling with intentional force and sped quickly behind some trees.  I stood there stunned.  Then I ran quickly to my phone and turned on my camera.  Through the trees I saw it moving but the trees were blocking my view so my phone wasn't picking it up.   Suddenly the thing shot up into the sky so high and turned green again.  It hovered there, turned blue, and shot back the way it came.  Then it stopped, turned red and fell out of the sky again and stayed down for 3 min shot back up turned blue and shot accross the sky again, stopped and started pulsing.  I believe I got it on camera when it got really close.   For a moment, it stopped and went around in a circle right in front of my apt before shooting straight up again.;38.2973796178344;-77.4933656050955

A white light in the eastern sky. Stationary for a few minutes, moved north.;2020-02-14 06:34:00;~3 minutes;A white light in the eastern sky. Stationary for a few minutes, moved north. On Valentine’s Day 2020, at about 6:30 AM, I was walking to my bus stop 1 minute away from my home. I saw an orb of light in the eastern sky.  This was under cloud cover, so I know it was not a high-flying craft.  The light was white, and it didn’t flicker or change colors.  It stayed stationary for a few minutes I captured a (fairly low-quality) photo on my phone at 6:34 and soon after, it started moving to the north, seemingly staying the same distance from me.  It moved fairly quickly but didn’t zip off.  As I saw it move, I got scared and turned around.  Two of my classmates got to the stop about two minutes later.  They didn’t say anything about seeing something, so I didn’t say anything to them. It should be noted that I live near a very small airfield, although I’ve never seen anyone out that early, and when I see those planes, they are always very identifiable as planes.  This didn’t appear to have any sort of craft attached to it.  Planes from Dulles and elsewhere never fly below the clouds near here.  I am a high school student, so even though I have a profound interest in UFOs, I may not have the knowledge that could debunk this.;38.2973796178344;-77.4933656050955

I'm looking up and notice theses solid white lights. They seem to circle some stars and then they stay still. Kinda like if they notice me looking at them. There's not just one of these solid lights sometimes they move in groups of two or more. They change directions very quick.I thought I was seeing things so I went in the house and I grabbed a flash light. I flashed it at the night sky. Probably 5 or 6 times. Next thing that happened was amazing and scary at the same time. Only way I can explain it. Was about 15/20ft from me and about 15ft high was a orange circle something shot out of it looked like a big bright light of energy that was orange and very beautiful odd shape and shot back into some type of circle. This happen so fast. If I blink my eyes it would have been gone. I've never seen anything like this. Very amazing. I! work full time been there 15 plus yrs;38.2973796178344;-77.4933656050955
