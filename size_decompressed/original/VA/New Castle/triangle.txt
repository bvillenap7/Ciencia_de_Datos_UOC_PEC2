I'm using my sisters room to sleep in, and I have been laying watching tv.  Out of the corner of my eye I saw something.  At first I thought it was just a reflection from my computer on the glass, but I closed my laptop and it was still there. 	I jumped up and looked out the window. about 75 feet about the tree line was a triangular shaped craft. Light at each corner.  I thought maybe a stealth bomberâ€¦ they do training runs through our area.  However no sound whatsoever.  I mean you couldn't hear a thing. and also, it was moving way too slow. Like 25 MPH, max.  The craft was at best guess, 20' each side.  I'm guessing here. but the three lights on the corners were prominent. 	At this point I went and got my other sister out of bed to see it.  She came and saw it just as it floated over the mountain ridge beside my mothers house.  But she did see it, this was not just a single person sighting.;37.4871;-80.1704
