I went into the backyard to throw out some scraps after supper.  I looked up at the sky and saw what I at first thought was the planet Venus.  Then I noticed that Venus was a bright white light in the southwestern sky.  I saw a yellowish white round light, that seemed to hover, more to the northern than Venus.  It brightened a couple of times to bright white light, then dulled down again.  It floated one way a little then another.  I realized it was not a plane, as it hovered.  It was not a helicopter as it made no noise.  It moved very smoothly.  I went in the house to get binoculars and looked at it.  It had a red light that strobed and moved up and down the orb.  I watched it float around until it moved off into the western horizon, behind trees and out of sight.  Slowly and without noise.  My husband saw it also.  He is a pilot and knew it was not a plane.;37.8554;-76.2852
