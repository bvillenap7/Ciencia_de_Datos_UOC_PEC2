1 LIGHT SEPARATES INTO 3 & HOVERS OVER TREE, THEN COMBINE & DISAPPEAR.;1996-04-15 21:00:00;3-4 minutes;1 LIGHT SEPARATES INTO 3 & HOVERS OVER TREE TOPS, THEN COMBINE & DISAPPEAR ME & MY MOTHER (I WAS 22 YEARS OLD AT THE TIME) WERE DRIVING UP THE NEW HIGHWAY INTO NORTON, VA, OUT OF BIG STONE GAP, VA AT ABOUT 9:00PM. TO THE LEFT OF US IS THE MOUNTAIN SIDE WHERE THE HIGHWAY HAS BEEN CUT IN.  TO THE RIGHT OF US IS A GORGEOUS VIEW OF THE LIGHTS DOWN IN THE VALLEY. TO OUR RIGHT THERE IS A MOUNTAIN RANGE CURLING AROUND ENCOMPASSING POWELL VALLEY.  ON THE VERY TOP OF THIS MOUNTAIN WAS THE OLD HIGH KNOB OBSERVATION TOWER, WHICH BURNED DOWN A FEW YEARS BACK. THERE IS A ROAD THAT FOLLOWS THE TOP OF THIS MOUNTAIN FROM HIGH KNOB ALL THE WAY AROUND THE MOUNTAIN AND BACK TO BIG STONE GAP VIA A SMALL HOLLOW CALLED &quotCRACKERS NECK&quot. MY GRANNIE ALWAYS TOLD ME STORIES OF SEEING LIGHTS MOVING AROUND THE SIDES OF THE MOUNTAINS IN DIFFERENT COLORS SINCE SHE WAS A SMALL CHILD.  SHE WAS BORN IN 1919. ON THIS PARTICULAR NIGHT MY MOM & I WERE DRIVING UP THE MOUNTAIN AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THIS HUGE BRIGHT LIGHT DROPS OUT OF THE SKY BUT SPLITS INTO 3 DIFFERENT LIGHTS BEFORE HOVERING OVER THE TREE LINE ON THE MOUNTAIN TO OUR RIGHT...WHERE HIGH KNOB IS. THE ONE HUGE LIGHT SEPARATED MAYBE 200 YARDS ABOVE THE TREES...ONE WENT LEFT...ONE STRAIGHT DOWN...& THE OTHER TO THE RIGHT BUT THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE DROPPED STRAIGHT DOWN WHILE THE OTHER TWO MOVED AWAY FROM IT MAKING A TRIANGLE SHAPE AS THEY WENT DOWN. THEY ALL HOVERED MAYBE 100-200 FEET OVER THE TREE TOPS FOR APPROXIMATELY 3-4 MINUTES...THEN STARTED BACK UP & MET BACK INTO ONE LIGHT BALL. IT THEN PROCEEDED TO TRAVEL STRAIGHT UP, INCREASING IN SPEED THEN VANISHED INTO THIN AIR!   MY MOM & I WERE BOTH QUIET FOR A FEW SECONDS BEING IN SHOCK… THEN SHE ASKED…DID YOU SEE THAT?.. .I REPLIED, WHAT DID YOU SEE?… SHE SAID, LIGHTS… I SAID, YES, I WONDER WHAT THAT WAS?… SHE SAID, I DON'T KNOW AND SURE DON'T WANT TO FIND OUT!   WE NEVER SPOKE OF IT TO ANYONE ELSE BECAUSE IT SCARED US TO DEATH & WE FIGURED PEOPLE WOULD THINK WE WERE CRAZY!  EVER SO OFTEN WE'LL BRING IT UP AGAIN JUST WONDERING WHAT IT WAS!

Multi-colored light moving sporadically across the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  ISS was in N sky at 22:55 hrs..  PD));2016-08-08 23:15:00;10 minutes;Multi-colored light moving sporadically across the sky. At around 23:15 on August 8th, 2016, I took my dog out before going to bed.  While standing in the yard, I happened to look up into the sky and saw what I thought to be an odd looking star.  About 15 seconds after looking at it, it began to move across the sky faster than an airplane would.  It started making all kinds of different moves in different directions at really fast speeds.  Then it would stop before cutting back in a different direction. It was white when I first saw it, but as it moved it began to change colors.  Not blinking... but more like shifting through many different colors.   I went back into my house to get my phone so I could video it, but it was too dark for anything to show up.  I sat and watched this thing for about 10 minutes while it made maneuvers all across the sky.  When it was over, it was just gone... like the light just cut off.   ((NUFORC Note:  There had been an overflight of the ISS at 22:55 hrs., but it would have been in the extreme northern sky, and would have lasted for only 96 seconds.  PD));36.8631;-82.77
