4 white, silent torpedoes slowly moving eastward near Deep Run High School;2021-08-18 19:30:00;15 minutes;4 white, silent torpedoes slowly moving eastward near Deep Run High School I observed a total of 4 individual torpedo-shaped white objects in the sky while walking home from Deep Run High School in Glen Allen, VA. I was walking from the school in the direction of the library when I first noticed one of these objects high up in the air with no contrail. My attempts at taking a photograph were not successful.  A few minutes later I noticed two more in the sky to my right, but close enough where I could make out a curious lack of wings or sounds. Their size at this lower altitude matched the size of a plane at a higher cruising altitude (visible contrails) I saw a few minutes later, suggesting these “torpedoes” are much smaller than a passenger aircraft.  After crossing Twin Hickory Road, I saw another one of these close to the moon at a similar altitude to the previous two. The airplane I previously saw was still in the sky, which is how I made the size comparison.;37.6880337748344;-77.5423523178809
