Unpatterned group of 6-8 objects travelling NE to SW at high speed and high altitude.;2009-12-20 12:00:00;5-10 seconds;Unpatterned group of 6-8 objects travelling NE to SW at high speed and high altitude. Saw what I thought was a passenger jet flying from northeast to southwest.  Then realized there was another object just behind and to its right.  As I focused, I realized there were 6-8 objects, all flying at same speed and altitude, in no particular pattern.  Thought the first one was a passenger jet because it appeared to be high up and moving fast.  But commercial airliners do not travel that close together and do not, at cruising altitude, appear from the ground to travel as fast as those objects passed over my house.  There was no sound, no exhaust trail.  Objects appeared to be silver metallic and/or reflecting the sun's light.  Could not tell their shape due to sun's brightness/reflection and distance.
