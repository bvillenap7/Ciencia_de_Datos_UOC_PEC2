Blinking white and red and blue colored stationary lights near Glen Allen, VA;2008-09-20 22:30:00;over 10 minutes;Blinking white and red and blue colored stationary lights near Glen Allen, VA At approximately 10:30-10:45 pm 09/20/08, my son called me in to his room to look at some lights in the sky.  Thinking it was a plane, at first I was skeptical.  I saw a bright light, about the size of a large star and seemingly far away that blinked constantly in bright white, red and occasionally blue.  We watched it constantly for several minutes to discern if it was moving…and it definitely was not.  After a few minutes, we noticed another of the same light objects to the left of the first, doing exactly the same thing.  It too was stationary, white, red and blue blinking lights…first one color then, the next…mostly white and red, but blue at times, too.  They were in the N/NE sky above the tree line, but we did not have to look up to see them.  We also saw various planes with blinking lights, moving…and stars…unmoving…these two objects were different.  I did not want to make a big deal of it, because my son is only 11, and after watching the lights for about ten minutes, I left the window and told him to go to sleep.  We will look again tonight, but I have never seen anything like it.  My son is 11, in sixth grade and of normal/above average intelligence.  I am a 43 year old female, with a Bachelor’s degree and post-grad education in the medical field, also of average to above average intelligence.  I was highly skeptical until I witnessed this with my own eyes…over at least a constant ten minute period.;37.6880337748344;-77.5423523178809
Driving S, an hour before dusk a very bright white light appeared. It was several times the size of any visible star.;2017-07-25 20:00:00;~5 seconds;Driving South, an hour before dusk, a very bright white light appeared.  It was several times the size of any visible star, although it was still light out and no stars were visible.  I looked away for about 2 seconds.  I tried to point it out to my passenger.  When I looked again, it grew into a mushroom cloud shape with the expansion pointing down towards the horizon.  Then, within another two seconds, i.R. disappeared.
