Family witnessed multiple round lights coming from nowhere in formation until randomly separating.  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-06-24 20:00:00;30+ minutes;Family witnessed multiple round lights coming from nowhere in formation until randomly separating and moving in different directions. My family and I were camping in Rice, Va 06/21/20 - 06/24/20.  Around 8pm on 06/23/20 my daughter came running to ask me to come outside and see the “creepy things in the sky!”  She, my other daughter, and son-in-law were all staring into the sky pointing at what they were seeing.  I looked up and saw multiple round lights moving higher than an airplane we saw a little while later.  I had my husband and 10 year old son join us outside to get their opinion.  The lights were moving in the same direction at first but randomly separated my husband said it could be a meteor shower until some of them stopped and changed direction.  Then several more began to appear directly above us as if they were coming from nowhere, traveling in the same direction, at the same speed, the same distance apart from each other.  We tried capturing pictures and video but the lights didn’t appear on camera.  After several minutes in the same formation, the objects separated and began traveling in random directions, some disappearing and reappearing, others completely disappearing.  None of us have an explanation for what we saw and it’s been on my mind since that night so I decided to report it.  I hope this information is helpful.;37.2754;-78.2815
