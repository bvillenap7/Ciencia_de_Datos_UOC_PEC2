Supper fast object stops dead wavers left then right then shoots strait up and gone MIDDAY!!!!;2004-09-20 13:30:00;10 to 15 sec;Supper fast object stops dead wavers left then right then shoots strait up and gone MIDDAY!!!! The small white or shiny object was traveling from east to west  It was going so fast that I thought that it was a metorite or shooting star I thought how weird that it was visable in the daytime As I watched it cross the sky it suddenly stoped dead in it's tracks Then it went left then right several times sort of like it could not decide which way it wanted to go Then it shot strait up, out of sight The thing did not have a tail like a shooting star  I am just impressed with how fast it was going then it didn't slow down it just stopped!!!!;38.1236;-78.7095
