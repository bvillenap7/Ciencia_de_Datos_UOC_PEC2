Flying V wing extremely low and slow.;2012-06-15 09:30:00;3 minutes;Flying V wing extremely low and slow. Living on farm in country, heard low murmur of an engine above, went outside onto my 22nd story deck and saw a very large aircraft, wide v shape, flying approx. 200-300 yards above me, 1 red light at the end of each wing, seemed to cruise very slowly over top and traveled north, almost seemed to be hovering unlike most jets and once a short distance away it was indistinguishable in the sky on a very bright starry night, my first thought was this is a UFO, then figured it was possibly a B2 bomber ...the thing is it was traveling extremely low and slow over me ...unlike any aircraft and not sure tthe large stealth bombers are capable of that.   I am guessing on date but was a very starry bright night. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));38.1236;-78.7095
