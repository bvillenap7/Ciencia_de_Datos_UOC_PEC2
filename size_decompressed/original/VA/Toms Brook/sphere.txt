Spotted single sphere of light flashing white, green, and red interchangeably, hovering in stationary position.   Continued to observe for 43 minutes.  Object would alternate between hovering in place, rapidly dropping up and down, moving horizontally or diagonally and at times would move in a circle or wave-like pattern.  The movements were too fast to have been a helicopter or plane.   It quickly dropped out of sight behind the mountains to the west.;38.9465;-78.4369
