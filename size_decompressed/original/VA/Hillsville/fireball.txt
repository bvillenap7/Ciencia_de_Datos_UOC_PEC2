Had a tail much like meteorite but was very bright/metallic and was very close.  It wasn't far above the tree line when it dissipated.  Have seen 2 similar objects over Galax, VA, also but did not document dates...they were identical except were white and faded to vivid blue instead of green.;36.7461;-80.7243
