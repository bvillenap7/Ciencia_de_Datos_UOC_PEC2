Pulsating Sphere in the Southwest sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus, we suspect.  PD));2013-11-12 19:44:00;20 minutes;Pulsating Sphere in the Southwest sky. My wife and I saw the sphere in the southwest sky.  It appeared brighter than any star in the sky and pulsated.   We live near a small airport and drove to it thinking that it may have been an aircraft landing.  We got to the airport about 3 minutes later and watched the object hang in the sky.   After reviewing video it appeared to move slowly to the left and then back to the right.  It then faded out very quickly after observing it from a stationary location for a few minutes.  And then it suddenly reappeared and then disappeared again a few minutes later. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus, we suspect.  PD));36.7461;-80.7243
