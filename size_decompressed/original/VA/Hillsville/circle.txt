The one higher up was steady in movement, while the one below was shaky.   They then began to spin around each other in a circle for a few seconds or so, then the higher one disappeared.   Shortly after, about fifteen seconds, they other one steadily disappeared.  They were roughly the size of Mercury if seen in the night sky.

We saw strange lights in the sky that appeared to be moving at a very fast speed .1 of them came over the horizan and came to a dead stop for about 3 mintutes .  Another object from the  north had been moving very rapidly and then stopped and turned around and moved the opposite way .  Planes dont come to a dead stop .We saw at least 6 or more of theses strange objects that night .  All the observers are in the medical field and have never seen anything like this before .  Also a plane was moving over head and another object moved to the plane at a very fast rate and started hovering over the plane .then quickly jumped below it .;36.7461;-80.7243
