Strange light in Virginia;2013-10-23 19:30:00;45 minutes;Strange light in Virginia I received a call from my neighbor around 19:30 asking me to check something out in the sky.  When I came out I looked at it and said oh that is the moon and she said no look at it it is moving.  I stared at it for a few minutes and it seemed like it was but it was hard to tell because it was far away.   I went back in the house to get my camera (Nikon Coolpix P510).  I was able to zoom in on it and that 's when I saw that it is moving in different directions left, right, up and down (not exactly in this order).  It was doing those moves in various speeds and sometimes it would just stand.   I went back into my house to record it from my upstairs window I recorded it for about 6 minutes went downstairs to show my husband and when I went back it was gone.   But the weirdest thing was when I looked at it at my computer you can see how the object was trying to change color or do something else I don't know how to explain it, it looked like waves going over it.  It reminde! d me of a tv when you try to fix the channel to find a clearer picture.  I was searching online to see if anybody saw or knew what it was but couldn't find anything, maybe you have an explanation for us.  I probably be able to send pictures or the video in the next couple days.;37.2718;-77.4028
