In 87' I witnessed what I believe to be a unique event .  Around that time Wythville was in the headlines on Unsolved Mysteries for mass UFO sightings. Lighted triangular shaped objects hovering at a low pattern and cornering like a  kid on a big-wheel. Yeah, yeah, saw that several times, that I could write off as man made.  One night however on a walk to my grandmother's house I saw what I am still to this day sure of. A semi-large brigt white object setting dead still somewhere lower than an airplane path would be.  No it wasn't Venus . I was sure of it's place in the atmosphere. What really sat me down was what was going on around it. 5 to 6 seperate red sigular lights where darting around away and some even merged with the white object. They did so in an unorganized manner . It was too high for a light show, and besides it is a small town, and there wouldn't be one anyway. I did get my grandmother to see for herself, and she did , but only I remember now.;36.9339;-81.0882
Two blue lights chasing each other across the interstate.;2015-04-23 22:00:00;Minute;Two blue lights chasing each other across the interstate. Saw one blue light traveling across the interstate, in a straight line, and another blue light chasing behind it on the same line, and no sound.   Then took of into the sky as high as the stars.;36.9339;-81.0882
