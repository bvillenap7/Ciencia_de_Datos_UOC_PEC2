Strangle Orange lights over Wytheville;2013-05-17 21:00:00;5 minutes;Strangle Orange lights over Wytheville It was 9 pm,  and I was pulling out of the driveway to pick up my brother. I noticed BRIGHT orange lights were just over the mountains towards Bland county, V.A.   The night was cloudy so that no stars, planes, or radio towers could be seen.  At first there were 2, then 3, and finally a fourth, all aligned in a constellation-like random pattern.  VERY slow moving.  They would completely fade out of sight, then reappear in a new pattern. This only lasted a few minutes and my guess is 5 at max.;36.9339;-81.0882
