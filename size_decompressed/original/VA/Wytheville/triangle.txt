We were driving on route 52 when my girlfriend looked up and saw something flying really low, like low enough to hit a tall tree, we thought it may have been a plane but there were so many lights that were different colors and it was going slow, it looked like a jet but it was going to slow, i was driving so i couldnt stop to really look at it or get a picture.;36.9339;-81.0882
