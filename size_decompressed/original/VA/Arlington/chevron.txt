Object in sight for approx 2.5 3.0 sec due to other object in sight (tree)  object moved faster then any other object veiwed in this area due to sky/stargazing.  Am familar with both civilan and military aircraft both older and current. The object was first sighted while stargazing with bi-noc's.  Object was in focus, but slightly distorred due to speed of traval across veiwing area.  Attepmts to re-aquire object after passing by trees unsuccessful.  object was chevron shaped with 6 circles inside the chevron. (each circle was seperate from the others by approx .05 in the bi-noc's)  Object was moving at extremely high speed and was viewed for 2.5 - 3.0 seconds prior to loss of sight due to tree in vision.  The chevron was very visable around the circles and appeared almost to be a B-2 shape with no idendifiable markings or identifiable as a B-2 due to the lack of the tail section.  This was NOT, repaet NOT a overfly of the B-2 or any other USAF, US Army, US Navy or civilian Aircraft that I have veiwed in the last 10 years or prior to that.
