I looked up and saw a ship about maybe 100 ft in the air. It's size was half the size of the arlington library and it was triangular with the corners cropped off. It hovered and made absolutley no sound whatsoever as it passed. There were lights on each end of the ship and as it passed it seemed to give out a calming emission of some sort.
