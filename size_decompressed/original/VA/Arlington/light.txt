We had gone outside to get our cat, who was on a ledge outside the second floor window and wouldn't come in or climb down, just kept meowing.  We were both looking up at the side of the house wondering how long we would have to wait for her to come down, when two circular white lights flew over the house, going more or less west to east or northeast.  they were about the size of a baseball held at arms length.  we both saw it.  about two minutes later they came back (or two others like it came by) again, from west to east/northeast.  this time they both stopped -- don't know how far away -- they seemed close, although the (?) spheres were small.  they both stopped for a second or two...as my son and i watched, one of the objects/lights flew away at a right angle to its previous path of flight ... not up in the sky, but back to the northwest at what seemed to be the same altitude as before.  the other object remained motionless for a few moments (5 seconds maybe) then continued to the northeast on pretty much its original direction.  they were definitely two different objects that were flying in tandem at first, then split up.  my son and i ran out to the front yard with the video camera, but didn't see anything more.  they made no noise.  they seemed small but close.  if they weren't close they must have been huge.  we read in the news that similar sightings were made last night in Waldorf Maryland, about 10 miles from our house. we always thought these things were crazy, but now we know better.

Lights after dusk in Arlington, Va.;2002-08-07 21:00:00;20 minutes;Lights after dusk in Arlington, Va. I was on my evening jog, along N. Glebe Road near its intersection with Pershing Drive in Arlington, Va. I stopped and stared across the road (toward the west). There were two very bright, white lights not moving, but hovering above the tree tops. It was just after dusk and they were way too big and too low to be stars, but they did not move but hung in the sky. One was a short distance away from the second. They did not move unless they slightly drifted, for about 20 minutes, when they were no longer visible to me but were behind the tree tops. I kept thinking maybe they were helicopters, but they did not make any noise. This is kind of near military sites, like the Pentagon and not too far from National Airport. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling stars, or perhaps landing lights on aircraft.  We do not know.  PD));38.8776356164383;-77.1007506849315
Dazzling bright white oval light falls from sky in Arlington, Virginia;2006-03-15 22:30:00;3 seconds;Dazzling bright white oval light falls from sky in Arlington, Virginia I don't remember the exact date, but this was in March 2006. I was walking home around 10:30 at night in Arlington, Virginia, just a few miles from Washington, DC.  Suddenly I saw a dazzling white, oval-shaped light fall from the sky at a constant rate and disappear over buildings on the horizon.  There was no sound.  The light was bright enough that it cast shadows around me. The oval was an even and pure white light.  I was bigger than a full moon.  I have no idea how far away it was, but didn't seem more than a few miles if that. I am an aviation enthusiast and have fulfilled all requirements for my private pilots license.  I cannot explain what I saw.  It was not a meteor because it seemed too large and had no tail.  It was not an aircraft.  The light was pure white and dazzling. The next day my carpool mate picked me up.  I was only a few hundred feet from his house when I saw the light.  He had been watching TV in his living room which faced the same direction I had been walking.  He told me that the room had filled with a bright white light at the same time I saw the object.  So I had independent corroboration. I called the Arlington police the next day to report it.  No one had seen anything.  I think the woman at the police station thought I was a nut. My carpool mate similarly thought I was nuts for reporting it. I still can't explain what I saw.  Anyone ever see something similar?

Approaching intense bright white light with a rainbow spectrum in the center witnessed at sun down on 04/07/07.;2007-04-07 18:45:00;20 min;Approaching intense bright white light with a rainbow spectrum in the center witnessed at sun down on 04/07/07. I was standing on the balcony smoking a cigar. I am watching the sun set to my right and at the same time there is another form of light that is forming right in front of me getting larger and more intense with its own light much brighter than the sun light. It was almost so bright creating a rainbow effect. I was really stuck in place, and I couldn't move for a secound then I snapped three pics using my cell phone camera. I would love for you to look at them and explain to me what it was....Really the pictures show it in clear detail... ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Three low bright orange objects following the same path fading to red with no sound or navigation lights.;2014-05-24 22:30:00;8 minutes;Three low bright orange objects following the same path fading to red with no sound or navigation lights. I saw the first large bright orange light going from north to south between Ballston and East Falls Church at around 10:30 pm.   As it passed directly over head, the light was reflecting off the bottom of the clouds as it the object was right below the cloud.  Absolutely no noise.   Before the first object faded into the distance another object followed the same path at the same speed.   By this time my neighbor had seen it as well.  Then as the second object faded to the south, a third even brighter object followed the same path.  Again, no noise and no navigation lights.  Just bright orange turning to dim red as they faded into the distance.   It took each object about 3 minutes to traverse the sky and their altitude was just below the clouds.;38.8776356164383;-77.1007506849315
Greenish bright light that moved up and down several degrees then rapidly fell towards earth.;2015-05-19 21:30:00;20 seconds;Greenish bright light that moved up and down several degrees then rapidly fell towards earth While sitting outside my condo I always watch the airliners ascending from Reagan National Airport.  Tonight I heard the sound of a jet fighter patrolling high in the sky.  At about 9:30 PM I was looking east, up at about 40 degrees altitude when I saw a greenish tinted bright light that was moving just perceptibly up and down in the sky.  After it moved up and down and up and down again it rapidly fell straight down.  My 6-story high building then obscured it further from view.  I might guess that the light was 1 to 2 miles distant, based on its size and brightness. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Multiple lights over Fort Myer.  ((NUFORC Note:  Lens flares from headlights, and a green traffic signal.  PD));2017-12-03 17:40:00;Unknown;Multiple lights over Fort Myer I went outside with my dog to see the super moon.  I did not notice anything around the moon when looking at it but I took three pictures of the moon and in one picture, there are two lights near it and the other, four white lights and two other lights to the side.  One picture has no lights.  I thought it might be a reflection but Iâ€™m not sure, since one picture had no lights.   The lights were right over the entrance/exit area to Fort Myer and are viewed from a residential neighborhood across Washington Blvd. ((NUFORC Note:  Lens flares from headlights, and a green traffic signal.

Fighter planes chase light over Washington, DC, area.;2020-02-04 23:00:00;1-2 minutes;Fighter planes chase light over Washington, DC, area. At 11 pm on Feb 4th I was awakened to a sound of fighter planes overhead. nI live right next to the Pentagon in a high rise.  I have not heard fighter planes since Sept 11th.  The noises were very loud rising and falling as the planes went overhead. I stepped out on my 16th floor balcony and could see two faint white lights moving in a circular pattern overhead.  I could not see the fighter plane or planes...but could see these lights.  One disappeared...but the other moved in a s shaped pattern and circled back...it did not happen any other lights on it.  Just a single white light. I called the local news station (radio) and reported what I had seen.  They said another man from Mclean, VA, had done the same.  (7 miles away maybe) I called a friend during the event..and he heard the noises as well..but did not see what i saw. Left a message with Washington Post.  Radio station said they would get to the bottom of it.  This was the State of the Union address night...so security was high...but the lights i saw were not moving in a normal pattern;38.8776356164383;-77.1007506849315
Jet fighters surround DC area in late night search;2020-02-05 23:00:00;15-20 minutes;Jet fighters surround DC area in late night search From 11 pm until 11:30 pm the entire Washington DC area was filled with the noise of jet fighter aircraft. Reported from Bethesda MD to Burke VA. This was NOT a drill!  The noise was so loud it woke me up out of a sound sleep. I live near the Pentagon in Arlington VA. When I went out to my 16th floor balcony I could see two small white lights moving in semi circle patterns. The did not seem to be airplanes..as they lacked any other lighting..and were high up.  I believe that jets were chasing these lights...which were very fast.  There needs to be pressure brought to ask why jets fighters were buzzing the area for 15-20 mins....and no..this was not because of the State of the Union address..which had been over for 45 mins before this occurred.  I am a retired history teacher and airline family member. I know what I saw..and this event is not a hoax...I can provide text from others who heard the jets...although not the lights.  I called a news radio station..they confirmed others were calling too. However..follow up calls the station..the Washington post..and Andrews Air force base have been fruitless....no story has been written..and the 113 Air National guard base at Andrews says they know nothing of what I am saying. They will not even confirm planes were launched. They are not telling the truth.;38.8776356164383;-77.1007506849315
White ball-shaped light heading East along the Potomac River toward Washington, DC (not a plane or helicopter);2020-11-07 05:28:00;20 minutes;White ball-shaped light heading East along the Potomac River toward Washington, DC (not a plane or helicopter) Travelling East along the Potomac River the object appeared to come to a stop over the Mall area over Washington, DC and hover at about 3,000 feet.  The light appeared to travel along the approach path to Reagan National Airport but much higher than planes usually fly and had no blinking navigational aids.  The object also did not descend as if it was going to land at National.  Instead it maintained its altitude until it slowed down over the Mall area and began to make a slow but sharp turn back in the direction it came from.  It did this twice and came to a stop.  It remained stationary for the next fifteen minutes or so.  While holding its position it continuously made small moves in a left-right motion and occasionally up and down.  As the sun rose, the light slowly became less visible and then just disappeared. It appeared initially to be a white light (ball shaped) when we first noticed it then with binoculars noticed that it had subtle blue and yellow overtones.;38.8776356164383;-77.1007506849315
