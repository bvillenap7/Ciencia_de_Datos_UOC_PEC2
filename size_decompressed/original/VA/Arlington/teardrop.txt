Bright fast moving glowing green object low in horizon at early evening;2016-02-16 19:14:00;5 seconds;Bright fast moving glowing green object low in horizon at early evening Was walking my dog, helicopter was in the area in apparent low large oval orbit with landing spotlight shining in Douglas Park area.  As it moved towards Four Mile Run Road, I saw an object moving along the dark skyline, traveling northwest.   The weather was clear, object glowed bright green with small glowing tail of green, my first thought it was an aircraft possibly the helicopter, but noted it was bright and moving horizontally at a moderately fast flight NW...second thought was it was a falling star type object, but it was too close to horizon to be that.   Object should possibly have been observed by helicopter in the area as they were in the same basic direction.;38.8776356164383;-77.1007506849315
