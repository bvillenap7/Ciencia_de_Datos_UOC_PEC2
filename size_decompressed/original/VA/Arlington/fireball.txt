I was runnning with my grilfriend a little after dark on a cloudy night. I looked up to notice a bright green light behind some low lying clouds. No noise and traveling at incredible rate of speed, I expected to hear a sonic boom. Looked as though it was a meteor entering the atmopshere, but too cloudy to absolutely tell. Heading south. Parrallel flight path to Reagan National airport. Dissapeared over horizon. I had forgotten the exact date and time, but I noticed other reports of green fireball seen through cloudcover in Richmond and Baltimore. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is indicated as being approximate.  However, please see other reports from the east coast for this date.  We suspect the date is accurate  PD));38.8776356164383;-77.1007506849315

There was a storm that had hit, a little bit of rain.  Anyways the power went out so a friend and I had gone outside on the balcony to see who else had lost power when we noticed an &quotorangey-red&quot sphere dipping down over Roslyn and then climbing back up again (something a plane would not do) then traveling up into the sky horizontally (something a plane would not do either). The object appeared to be round, my friend said it looked like a fireball or something.  We noticed it a second time coming towards my apartment building, traveling East and it appeared to get darker as it traveled higher... from an orange color to a darker red.  As soon as the object had left the area, my Comcast (TV) signal then came on.  Anyways, I've filmed it if anyone is interested. Couldn't get a solid photo of course.;38.8776356164383;-77.1007506849315
