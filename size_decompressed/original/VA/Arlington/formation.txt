In the beginning, one could see a V shaped trail that moved at a speed much faster than a commercial/military type plane.  Moments later, in same area, one saw several lights flash, circle, and them move out in formation.  The lights would appear -- one in each corner of a square, and then move to the center, circle around each other in the center of the square, and then move back.  This occurred over a period of 45 minutes.  I could only say that the only reason I saw this was because my friend also witnessed the same thing...but in Falls Church.  He called me around 12:30 am to tell me to go outside and see if I am seeing the same thing he was. ((NUFORC Note:  We note that the description provided by the witness is consistent with a sighting of rotating advertising lights.  PD));38.8776356164383;-77.1007506849315

Imagine a pizza cut into four slices the lights met in the center and then spread out making an X then out to the edge.  Each light outlined 1/4 of a circle.  This happened in the only cloud in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));38.8776356164383;-77.1007506849315
Three Objects with Colored Contrails in the Skys over Arlington, Virginia;2021-06-09 13:30:00;1 Minute;Three Objects with Colored Contrails in the Skys over Arlington, Virginia Proceeding Eastbound on Route 66. Took Fairfax Drive/Glebe Road Exit.  While stopped in traffic at light at intersection of Fairfax Drive and Glebe Road, facing East towards Washington, DC, I was surprised to see multiple objects in front of me, at an elevation of about 45 degrees and at a height of about 1,500 feet. Ultimately, I counted three objects. Each of which was followed by a long, twisted, winding contrail, of perhaps 1,000 feet or more. The contrails were identical for each object, but were not the typical contrail from condensation of water vapor. Rather, they were brown/reddish in color. The three objects moved helter-skelter, crossing each other's paths. I initially thought that they might be helicopters that had been struck by surface to air missiles (very reminiscent of a scene in London has Fallen.  But there was no sound.  Then I saw what appeared to be a regular airplane in the nearby area, flying--it was a mid-sized plane with! what appeared to be a fixed (non-retracted) nose landing gear. This led me to think that perhaps the objects were sky divers or hang-gliders.  But the airplane was oblivious and was flying in a direction different from the three object.  In an instant, two of the objects--and their contrails--vanished.  Only one object remained.  Then the last object and its contrail also vanished.  I had a smartphone and thought of taking a picture but I fumbled around unable to figure out how to use and it was too late anyway.  I called my friend as the matter was unfolding and asked if he was aware of what I had just seen.  He was not and said he would check the news.  Very odd as I thought the objects were in restricted airspace.  I suggested that maybe it had been a publicity stunt.  I'm reporting for what it's worth in case no one else does. This happened in broad daylight, in plain view. I would be surprised if it was not observed by many people in addition to myself.  !;38.8776356164383;-77.1007506849315
