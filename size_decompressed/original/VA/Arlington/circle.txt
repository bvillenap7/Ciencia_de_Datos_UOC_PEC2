PD));2004-10-09 22:30:00;15 minutes;While walking my dog, I saw a light in the southern sky.  Upon watching it, I saw that there were actually four lights racing in a circle.  After about ten seconds the four lights met at the center of the circle and remained there about five seconds.  The cycle repeated again and again and I watched it about 15 minutes.  There was some cloud cover so I only saw hazy lights but there was no sound.  The balls of light appeared to be about the size of a quarter held at arms length.

Green flashing orb floating above the Douglas Park neighborhood of Arlington, VA;2013-10-19 00:17:00;4 minutes;Green flashing orb floating above the Douglas Park neighborhood of Arlington, VA. Looking at the full moon and noticed a bright shape moving off to the left.  It was green and would change to red at irregular intervals as it moved around in a random pattern, staying within a particular area.   I went into the house and got my phone to film it and captured two short clips before it dropped behind my roof and trees.

Stationary white light observed by two people for several minutes.;2014-07-07 21:00:00;5 minutes;Stationary white light observed by two people for several minutes Bright, non-flickering white object in sky before any stars were visible. Star Walk iPhone program located it in roughly the location of star Dubhe (end of bowl in Big Dipper).   Appeared to be stationary during several minutes of observation (we didn't see it appear--it was already visible when we went out on our deck), though there were no nearby visible reference objects for confirmation.  Brightness roughly that of Jupiter, but way too far from the ecliptic to be a planet.   My wife & I looked away for a few seconds while discussing where our binoculars might be, and when we looked back it had completely vanished,  So, unfortunately, we did not see if it flickered out or vanished in an instant.   Thought it might be a meteor headed directly towards us, but the brightness seemed too steady for that. We sometimes observe rocket launches from Wallops that appear as stationary spots when headed away from us, but there were none scheduled toda! y that we know of.   Definitely too little motion over the period of the observation for it to be an ordinary aircraft. Seemed too bright (and stationary) to be a satellite.;38.8776356164383;-77.1007506849315
Explosion and then a Giant Star-like object appeared and ascended.;2015-03-06 19:30:00;2 minutes;Explosion and then a Giant Star-like object appeared and ascended I was walking back from taking the garbage out and saw what looked like a shooting star. The shooting star/object was moving west away from Washington, DC..  As it was moving west, it exploded into two pieces.  It looked like a blue flame that split into two.  Half of it went West and the other half moved East and disintegrated.   At that moment I thought it was pretty cool that I saw a shooting star, but then thought I never seen a shooting star explode like that.   I then proceeded to look up at the sky and about a minute after I saw the explosion, I looked up and saw what looked like a very big star.  I would say it was comparable to the size of the North Star.  The Star got bigger and then started to ascend upward and disappeared.   Now I am an educated man and have seen dozens of shooting stars but never saw a shooting star explode and then see object in the sky move closer to Earth and then ascend upward and out of our atmosphere.  Pretty crazy but pretty exciting as well.;38.8776356164383;-77.1007506849315
The object was shaped like a doughnut with a large hole in the center, probably 3 feet wide in total.  ((anonymous report));2019-01-20 09:25:00;30 seconds;The object was shaped like a doughnut with a large hole in the center, probably 3 feet wide in total, moving forward but flipping. The object was shaped like a doughnut with a large hole in the center, probably 3 feet wide in total.  It moved in a forward motion but was flipping and twirling at the same time.  It was flying low to the ground but above the rooftop and treetops as viewed from my window.   I am a clear-headed well-educated individual, and this was viewed in daylight.  My initial thought it that it was a type of drone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));38.8776356164383;-77.1007506849315
