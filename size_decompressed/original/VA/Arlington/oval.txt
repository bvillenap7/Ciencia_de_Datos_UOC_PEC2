Oval object making no noise moving N. to S. looked transparent except for the edge reflecting sunshine.;2016-12-10 08:40:00;30 seconds;Oval object making no noise moving N. to S. looked transparent except for the edge reflecting sunshine. Bright clear morning looked up and thought I saw the edge of the moon, but it was too small and too faint.  It was moving quickly from North to South and seemed to be around 2000 feet up.  Object was barley visible like it was transparent.  I looked from another spot to be sure it wasn't my eyes playing tricks but it's course never wavered.   I dropped what I was holding and ran to get some binoculars but it was gone or I couldn't find it again when I got back outside.  No noise and very hard to spot.  I don't know how I saw it at first but the sun was coming up behind it and causing a shine off of its edge.    There was a commercial jet near by that had leveled off after take off and had moved only about 6 of it's fuselage lengths.;38.8776356164383;-77.1007506849315
