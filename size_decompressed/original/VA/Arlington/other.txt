Large Bird Drone Seen Flying Over VIP Security Helicopters?;2016-09-13 10:50:00;5 minutes;Large Bird Drone Seen Flying Over VIP Security Helicopters? I was in my front yard watering flowers.  About 10:40 AM two UH1N helicopters started making wide circles around my neighborhood (dark blue fuselage, white on top) which usually indicates there is a federal VIP in the area for some event.  The helicopters were flying low, about 300 feet altitude.  They circled the neighborhood in 2 mile circles several times.   After the helicopters passed nearly overhead I looked up and saw a large bird circling overhead at about two thousand (2000) feet altitude.  I had seen a similar large bird before a year ago when a couple of UH1N helicopters circled my neighborhood.  The bird did not flap its wings but soared in tight circles for 30 seconds and flew to another location and soared in tight circles for another 30 seconds, and then soared to another location, soared in tight circles for another 30 seconds.  I estimate the bird had a wingspread of 10 feet.  The bird appeared to be alternately black and silver.   I ran indoors to grab a pair of binoculars, and by the time I returned, the helicopters and bird had disappeared.;38.8776356164383;-77.1007506849315
