I was sitting in the dining room organizing some paper work when I noticed the wall adjacent to me suddenly go from dim to very bright.   I looked out the window and could hardly see because of such a bright light.  The WHITEST BRIGHTEST light I have ever seen.  We live in a wooded area, so a vehicle is out of the question.   As soon as the light faded I looked up to see a, clear as day, triangular shaped aircraft.  There were other lights, but not nearly as bright as this one, and the light that I witnessed had a radius of my whole yard.  All of the lights were the purest white imaginable. The witnesses included, myself, my husband, my two children, and my two dogs who went completely insane even before I saw this.   None of us were believers, and we are all very devout christians but this.. was too much to not believe.;38.3081;-78.4827
