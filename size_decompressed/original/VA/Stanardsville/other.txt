My wife alerted me to what first appeared as a bright star around midnight.  The star was toward the South.   As we watched, the star appeared to brighten and then dim repeatedly.   We also both separately observed the star move in a zigzag and slight circular pattern.   The star appeared to be slowly moving South. ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius.  PD));38.3081;-78.4827
