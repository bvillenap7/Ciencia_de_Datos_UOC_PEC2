There was a very bright flashing light north of Charlottesville, Virginia.  I could see at least two small red lights but they did not appear to be flashing.   At one point the bright light dimmed to red for a few moments and then returned to a bright, bright flashing white light.  I recorded the light on my cell phone briefly.  I saw a similar light some years ago, but that light actually bobbed up and down erratically.  I did not stay to see how long it was there. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the date is correct.
