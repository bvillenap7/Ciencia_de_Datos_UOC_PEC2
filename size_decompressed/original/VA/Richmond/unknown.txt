I went back in and it then slipped my mind. They were over the adjoining subdivision, there were 5 of them, the shap was unidentifiable, it was in a slight, W formation, they just flew around then headed north east, they were green and white, with the lead being purple,;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252
Very big slow moving object with lights;2002-06-15 21:30:00;15 secs;Very big slow moving object with lights I was going outside to take out the trash, the date i have a hard time to remember but it was in 2002 and at night but not late so id say 9:30. (I didnt really know where something like that could be reported)  I was standing next to my Dads truck and i look to my left i see about 4 lights  2 in the front and 1 on each of the sides. think of a trianle of (A B C)  AB was one leg and BC was the other leg , and AC was the Hypotenus, and there is one light on A and a light on C and the other 2 lights are around point B.  Well im standing there just looking at this moving... I didnt hear any engine or anything like that. and it was flying way to slow and low than any airplane i have ever seen..and it seemed to slow for a airplane to stay in the air.it went from my left to the right until it disapeared behind the trees. It didnt have the blinking lights that all planes are supposed to have to show that they are in the air . and this thing was extreamly large.. i cant imagine how something that big could stay in the air while it was moving that slow. it looked more like a bomarang .however that might be spelled ((NUFORC Note:  Date in 2002 is unknown.  We have assigned an arbitrary data above.  PD));37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252
witnessed an object not far above the highway with steady green and red, and white lights near I95 in Richmond, VA;2002-11-04 03:00:00;2 minutes;witnessed an object not far above the highway with steady green and red, and white lights near I95 in Richmond, VA While driving home to RI from Florida on Rt.95 I noticed ahead in the sky a flying object with red, green, and white light glide around in a circle about 300ft above the highway.  I thought it was a helicopter except the light pattern suggested a different shape, as the lights were where wings would have been. But it didn't act like a plane by its maneuvers. It swooped down toward the ground then back up again. There were no other aircraft in the sky and I don't know what was on the ground below the object, but it seemed to be searching for something on the ground. I only watched it for about 2 minutes as we drove north and couldn't see it anymore. It just seemed odd in its actions and appearance and the lights didn't seem to fit those of an aircraft. The lights didn't blink but were constant. I have no idea what it was it did not glow, but only had those lights. It stayed in the same area until I couldn't see it anymore. It just seemed different from any aircraft.;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252
Two bright lights hovering over Richmond.   ((NUFORC Note:  Venus and Jupiter.  PD));2004-11-05 05:00:00;Uncertain;Two bright lights hovering over Richmond At approx. 5am I awoke to let my dogs out into the back yard of my suburban home.  It was still very much dark outside, but clear.  Much clearer than usual.  There wasn't the typical pink haze above Richmond.  My attention focused directly toward the Eastern sky where I saw what would be two stars.  Most stars aren't very bright and even the North star had never glown this brightly. The lights we're side by side and at a slight angle.  I want to say that they moved slightly, much like hovering in one place for an extend period time.  I pointed them out to my wife, who had just gotten out of the shower and was quite alert.  She agreed that it was not normal and became more or less scared enough to call her sister at 5:25 in the morning.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus and Jupiter.  PD));37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252
UFO looses cloak while traveling.;2006-12-27 18:00:00;one second;UFO looses cloak while traveling. I was in my front lawn and loking up at the cloudy sky when an object flew past under the clouds.  It seemed to appear and then disapear in less than a second and in that time it had to have traveled half was to a third of the way through the entire sky. All it was was one large light with a smaller light close behind it, probably connected to the same craft. It absolutely did not come in through the clouds then back up giving the illusion of appearing and dissapearing, it seemed like it was traveling in a straight line very quickly and for some reason became visible or lost its cloak somehow.  Very weird. The shape may have been tear shaped but I could be certain because of the immense speed.;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252
Unknown Object  making  unbelievable turn over Richmond;2007-09-28 15:30:00;5 min.;Unknown Object  making  unbelievable turn over Richmond I was travelling west on I-64 on my motorcycle near Richmond (RIC) Airport when I noticed a craft which I presumed to be a military jet at approximately 10-12 thousand feet come from behind a big cloud formation.  It was heading SSW.  After a short distance, it turned back the way it came.  It didn't bank like a jet, It turned almost immediately around and headed back to the cloud.  I watched for the next 5 miles for it to reappear but, it never did.   When I got to I95 heading south I saw a larger plane seemingly flying past this particular cloud formation.  Not sure of what I saw here. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicate a date of October 28, 2007, which is illogical.  We have amended the date above, to indicate a date of September 28, which makes more sense.  PD));37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252
Slow moving craft with short bursts of vertical contrail....;2010-11-14 15:30:00;6 minutes;Slow moving craft with short bursts of vertical contrail.... On Sunday, November 14 at approximately 3:30 p.m. I noticed a slow moving object tracking in a Northern direction.  The object appeared as only a bright light and had a short contrail – but was not behind the craft but below it.  The contrail also appeared to be in bursts at times. I called 911 who then transferred me to the tower at Richmond International Airport.  They said they had no “reports”.  I then went into the house to find a camera to take pictures – batteries were dead.  The craft then started on an Eastward path, stopped, and just hovered for at least three minutes since I contacted the tower once again and the answer was the same.  When I informed him that an aircraft was going in that same general area but lower and if they looked up at 11:00 I’m sure they would see it.. Approximately 5 minutes later, three (3) fighter jets were scrambled to the same area and I also witnessed an AWAC (hopefully right) radar plane but not on the same course of the jets, but also going to that general area. At the same time in the West area aircraft were spotted with regular contrails that were a great deal longer than the contrail coming from this craft. The craft could not be seen to assess the shape – it was basically a light or just very shiny and the sun was just reflecting off of it.  It appeared as almost a “star” kind of twinkling..;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252
A wobbling, slightly moving object with 1-3 visible flashing red lights.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a sighting of Mars.  PD));2018-09-26 22:00:00;Unknown;A wobbling, slightly moving object with 1-3 visible flashing red lights. Last night I saw an unusual thing in the sky.  It was directly south at the 12:00 position.  It caught my eye because it was moving, but not far.  It was more like a wobble, changing short positions in the blink of an eye.  I got the binoculars out and saw there were several red lights flashing in different positions on the thing.  My husband insisted it was the Planet Mars.  I've never seen Mars with flashing red lights. I checked on it again around midnight and it was gone.  I posted the info on social media and others claimed to see it, too.  I'm skeptical of their claims.  Thank you~ ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a sighting of Mars.  PD));37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252

It didn’t sound like an airplane. we stood still until the sound disappeared and then we heard gurgling noises in our backyard. it was too weird to be any animal. it was creepy and then our dog started barking;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252
