The object appeared to be black,10lights down each edge of triangles front,one large powerful searchbeam in front piercing the fog erratically~ it was totally silent.;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252

I was outside viewing the lunar eclipse around midnight.  To the south of the moon I saw movement and there were approximately 8-10 faint white lights in a circle.  There were some clouds so maybe they were behind them.  They were really high in the sky and I thought from their angular shape they were birds at first.  They flew in formation and each light peeled away from the ring and made a spiral in the sky, like drawing a number 9, then disappeared.  It all happened within a minute or so.   I kept looking to see if I could see them again, but they were gone.;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252
