Green fireball visible thru thick, low clouds.;2002-01-07 17:43:00;2 seconds;Green fireball visible thru thick, low clouds. A green fireball travelling from the WNW to ESE.  Lasted about 2 seconds.  The interesting thing is that the cloud cover was thick and fairly low.  The fireball appeared to be just inside the clouds.  The location of the sighting was driving into the the parking lot of the Tuckahoe YMCA on Patterson Avenue. ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports from the east coast for this date.

A light outside Richmond, Virginia.;2005-01-07 22:30:00;<2 seconds;A light outside Richmond, Virginia. I wouldn't normally report something like this, but it's the second time I've personally seen something out in this area.  Both times it has been a single light moving across the sky. What made this one different is that a friend of mine saw this one with me.  This one seemed to make a direct dive to the earth after we first saw it move into our view.  Before reaching the tree line it turned off (for lack of better words)   We discussed this for at least 45 minutes, concluding that it was maybe 100 yards away, give or take, and that it didn't look like any meteor we'd ever seen.  It had a white center, and a blueish glow around it. As it passed clouds, it did light them. As a side note, the one I saw on my own was in the same area, and had a similar appearance, but looked much closer, seemed to move horizontally, and went behind the trees instead of dissappearing. I really would hope that someone can either explain this light, or has also seen it.;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252
green-blue fireball/meteor shooting across sky;2005-11-12 22:45:00;1-2 seconds;green-blue fireball/meteor shooting across sky While travelling east on I-64 15 miles outside of Richmond,VA at approximately 22:45 on November 12, 2005, I saw a green-blue fireball shoot across the sky from right to left (south to north). It was much larger than the average shooting star, and I assume it was a sizeable meteor.

Flickering fireball silently flying parallel to plane across the sky a few hundred feet in the air.;2015-06-08 21:45:00;45 seconds;Flickering fireball silently flying parallel to plane across the sky a few hundred feet in the air. 2 lights popped up over the horizon, one a plane, and one that looked like a petri dish that was full of a flammable liquid set on fire... it was more like fire and flickering coming up out of it than a fireball.   Only a few hundred feet from the ground, it moved silently parallel to the plane and went from one side of the sky to the other in a straight line.   Two pizza delivery personnel and my fiance saw this and we're unable to explain it.;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252
Large, silent blue meteor like object fly over James River and quickly disappear.;2015-08-03 03:45:00;30 seconds;Large, silent blue meteor like object fly over James River and quickly disappear. My boyfriend and I were walking home to The Fan neighborhood from a friends house on the south side near Midlothian, early in the morning, between 3:30 and 4 AM.  We were crossing the 35 cent bridge that goes over the James River, when, to our left, we saw a blue shooting star-like object with a trail of what looked like smoke fly west for about 2 seconds before completely disappearing.   My first thought was that it must be a meteor, but it was way too low in the sky and was flying too slowly.  It made no sound and like I said it disappeared after a couple seconds.  The whole thing happened pretty quickly, and was like nothing I have ever seen before.  There was another person walking toward us going the opposite direction over the bridge and when we crossed paths we asked him if he had seen it too.  He said he did and just as we were describing it to each other, we both saw another object flying farther away and in another direction (north), but this one was not blue or particularly lit up.  It appeared much smaller as it was much farther away and was going much faster.  After searching the Internet for meteor showers in the region or anything to explain what it might have been I have found nothing.;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252
