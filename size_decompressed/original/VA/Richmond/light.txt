horizontal moving bluish green light;2002-01-07 17:45:00;approx 3 sec.;horizontal moving bluish green light I was in parking lot at Midlothian Turnpike and a colored light (one?)I thought was a low flying airplane -caught my eye because the color was a beautiful bluish green and very bright. I noticed it was moving at a steady rate of speed and no other lights and no sound. I then noticed how fast it was moving and yelled at my co-worker to look but it passed very quickly horizontally from west to east at what appeared to be exactly the same altitude.Didn't look like a shooting star-too low , no tail, and the light was a steady rate of speed and much too fast & silent for an aircraft. Wondered if anyone else saw it. ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports from the east coast for this date.  PD));37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252
My coworker saw the blueish light too!!!;2002-01-07 17:45:00;seconds;My coworker saw the blueish light too!!! I posted the previous description of the light seen on Midlothian Tnpk last night and found out today that my coworker (Alice W.)was telling the following story: She had left work and was at the light at Hull st and Hicks Rd and saw a fast moving blueish light higher than the treetops but lower than an airplane and much faster moving. She also saw what may have been a second stationary blueish light off to the right. Her description matched mine and I felt SO MUCH BETTER that someone else had seen the same thing. I called my husband immediately since he had been ribbing me about little green men. I don't know what it was but I know what I saw and now someone else saw it too!!!

Moving Stars? ((NUFORC Note:  Possible satellites, we suspect.  PD));2004-08-01 02:00:00;30-60 seconds;Moving Stars? Hello, I was sitting in my hot tub late at night on a clear evening there wasn't much moonlight if any at all.  I was facing east while resting my head back on the side of the hot tub. I was staring up at the starts as I do frequently. I noticed out of the corner of my right eye, something moving south to north from behind a tree. It looked just like medium bright star but moved steadily across the sky. It was not a passenger jet, it was way too high and had no blinking lights at all and was moving faster than planes at that altitude move. I see heavy air traffic on a regular basis and this didn't look like any of it.  It reminded me of a waterbug gliding on water. I followed it across the sky, I'd say it covered a distance equaling if I held my arms out above my head as far apart as I could.  I thought maybe it was the ISS or something however a few weeks later I saw something even more strange.  I was again in my hot tub watching the stars only I was facing north and the objects were moving from east to west. This time they looked the same, like medium bright stars but there were three of them. One obviously running and two that were pursuing the leader. The lead light was not moving in a straight steady line it was maneuvering and the pursuers were reacting. The lead pursuer was probably half the distance between the first and last object. They formed a triangular formation. These objects also reminded me of water bugs. I wondered if the objects may have been fighter jets since there are  plethora of military installations within 100 miles of my home. These craft had no blinking lights either, and they had to be at an extremely high altitude, it seems unlikely that I would be able to see jet afterburners that brightly. I mean these things looked just like starts they were good size, bigger than passenger jets look at night so the fighter jet thing just doesn't make sense to me.  Anyway, I keep watching.

Bright craft in sky over Richmond, VA;2011-02-13 20:00:00;4 min;Bright craft in sky over Richmond, VA Sunday night right over the city of Richmond, VA.  It was a single light object (could be the magnetic field around craft) starting off inspecting a plane's chemtrail then started making quick maneuvers, stopping abruptly and then continuing to bounce around to different areas.  It eventually headed east and our vision was blocked by trees.  It lasted for around 4 minutes.;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252
Flashing stationary objects;2012-02-08 01:50:00;>20 min;Flashing stationary objects One light spotted, flashing, appears blue and red towards the South, noticed two more at different distances and positions in sky.  All flashing, the other three spotted after some observation, most appear to have red flashing lights.  Appears to be an verticle object with two lights each, one on top and one on bottom.  They're all fading very slowly but not moving at all.  Too high to be helicopters, the more I look the more I see, all fading gradually and stretching from South to West. I'm on the 9th floor on a balcony. If they're moving, they're each moving directly away from this building, or they really are fading, but the ones I can still see are still blinking and don't appear to be moving from their original positions.

A witness and I saw 2 UFOs within 1 minute in Fishing Bay VA.;2013-06-14 09:50:00;1 minute;A witness and I saw 2 UFOs within 1 minute in Fishing Bay VA. At 9:50 pm in Fishing Bay VA, I was looking at the sky with another witness on a boat in Fishing Bay when I suddenly noticed a light flying through the sky.  It was moving WAY to fast to be a plane, though it seemed like one.  I tried to ignore the object, but at about 9:51 another object appeared.  It appeared to be a plane like the last one, but again, it was moving WAY to fast to be one.  I took a closer look, and it appeared to have rings around it.  The other witness then told me they could not recognize what they where, and we then concluded they where in fact a UFO.;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252

Orange ball of light flickers and disappears over Richmond, VA.;2013-08-27 20:30:00;60 seconds;Orange ball of light flickers and disappears over Richmond, VA A few weeks ago (from August 27) my boyfriend and I, saw 3 orange orbs of light in the sky.  They were all heading south east, and rapidly changed direction heading northwest. They moved slowly, and there were no blinking lights indicating human aircraft.  We tried to follow them, but eventually lost sight because of tree lines. Today (August 27) we saw the same ball of orange light.  It was only one this time. We were observing to see if it was the same thing.  We stopped our car to look more carefully when we saw the ball of orange light flicker, as if it were a light bulb.  It wasn't a blink with any kind of rhythm. It flickered about 3 times.  On the third flicker, it disappeared completely.  It was too low in the sky to be covered by clouds.  There were no trees or high buildings for it to go behind in the area. It didn't fade away, it simply flickered and disappeared.;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252

Noticed three orange/red lights that at first appeared to be aircraft, but they had no blinking lights.  They also made no sounds.  We could see them come from the east moving west typically in groups of 3s.  They were relatively low.  Did not travel in a line - some where higher, some were lower.;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252
Green and Red lights in the sky around 5:15 PM, Richmond,VA.on I-64;2013-12-03 17:15:00;Few seconds;Green and Red lights in the sky around 5:15 PM, Richmond,VA.on I-64 I was driving on I-95/64 W,  took the left exit on junction toward I-64W (Bryan Parks Interchange), driving that section and before completely connecting to I-64 W, there was a stationary object in the sky.  I could see it clearly, the 2 distinct lights, one was Red and other one was Green, initially I thought it was an airplane but realized that lights were not blinking and were very prominent like in bright signal lights, also those were like connected to a stationary object and not moving like airplane.  Traffic was very slow, I was able to observe this for sufficient amount of time to confirm that it was an unusual sight, it was a clear dark sky with no other distracting interference.;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252
Similar to bright stars, with slight movement and color change.;2015-09-18 23:00:00;5 hours;Similar to bright stars, with slight movement and color change. My friend and I witnessed 3 points of light that looked like bright stars.  These lights were whitish, but seemed to have blinking colors of light that would change every so often, but then return to a whitish hue.  These lights were quite spread out, and were brighter than the surrounding stars, and seemed to move slightly up, down, left and right in a small space, like they were trying to not make too much motion to try to blend in as stars, but they were definitely not static lights, but not a whole lot of movement.  I witnessed these lights to remain in the sky for hours, and I've never seen anything like it before, blew my mind, even called the police non emergency line to see if they received any other reports, and they said that they did not.

I also saw the object quicky merge with what I believe was a star and for a split second I saw that thet had conjoined before changing back to its odd shape.  What stood out were the lines of light surrounding the main object.   I think the other two objects were stars however the third star was red and may have been a planet so I am not sure.;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252
Medium light orb fell from the sky into the trees.;2019-12-08 01:25:00;Very quick;Medium light orb fell from the sky into the trees. I was driving from my boyfriends house on Bailey Bridge Rd in N Chesterfield, VA, heading towards Hull Street. I was passing Battlecreek Drive and saw a orb of light the size of a stop light when you are sitting at the Intersection. It was very quick, and seemed to curve slightly, it dropped from right above the tree line into the tall trees that are to the left of the turn from Bailey Bridge Rd onto Battlecreek Drive. I also think it might have dimmed a little bit, but that also could have been the trees.;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252
Strange flashing lights hovering and the sound of whales singing from all around me in the sky;2020-12-02 23:00:00;5 minutes;Strange flashing lights hovering and the sound of whales singing from all around me in the sky What I really want to report are the sounds I heard for a short time while the craft was present. There was a strange craft that was only a few miles from the tree tops about 2 miles from me. It had strange flashing lights and kept hovering straight up and down. When it got very high in the sky, it would almost look like it was trying to mask itself as a star except that I could tell the lights were flashing and I had been following it since it was close to the tree tops. It kept going up and down and hoovering, and my attention was first brought to it by my dog and many other dogs in the neighborhood barking at it. I do live near naval bases and DC, so it could have been something military related. I did see at least one jet flying dark above my head with all its lights off except for a blinking red light. I cannot be sure of what the craft was except that it stayed in the sky for a very long time, but at a much higher altitude to mask itself as! a star maybe, but it's not part of our normal night sky. It seemed that it could mask itself to look like a star if no one really looked at it, knew that it isn't part of the night sky, or saw it at a lower altitude like I did. I felt like it might have been a form of camouflaging itself. I take all of that with a grain of salt. What I truly want to report about the incident is that at one point I walked outside and could hear what sounded like whales or dolphins speaking to each other from all around me in the sky. The sounds were not in any pattern or rhythm. It sounded organic and fluid, and it sounded like a beautiful conversation. It felt like it was all around me, just as if I were under water listening for the origin of a sound. The best I can describe it as the sound of whales singing songs, but in the sky. That lasted about 5 minutes. That part was roughly probably at about 11pm.;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252
