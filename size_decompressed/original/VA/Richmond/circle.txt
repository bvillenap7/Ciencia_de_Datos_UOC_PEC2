Very weird.;2003-08-30 06:00:00;a minute or two;Very weird. I am an early waker but I thought it was weird when I woke up at 3:30 and was fully awake and couldn't go back to sleep. I layed in bed for a while and absolutely couldn't sleep, then I put on some light music and went to lay down on my bed next to my window. I could tell that it was starting to get kind of light outside and I thought it would be cool to watch the sunrise since I was awake anyway. That's when I noticed in the distance just a gold shining ball. It looked like a huge gold star but I knew it was too big to be a star. So i thought it was a planet but it was moving toward me and it was getting bigger. As it got closer I could see the lights flashing on it and there were like these red and blue lights with gold lights on the bottom, the red and blue lights were on the sides. So i thought it was like some really weird fancy airplane, but it was a circle, and it just flew right by. I am really scared right now...I sat there and told myself it was a plane and to forget about it but I cant. It's just weird because the other day I was talking with my friends about UFO's and I was saying how i don't believe in them at all and that they're weird.;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252

Huge circular something crosses I 295 on 10/24/12 at 16:14.;2012-10-24 16:14:00;90 minutes;Huge circular something crosses I 295 on 10/24/12 at 16:14. This afternoon while traveling North bound on interstate 295 something caught my eye in my peripheral vision.  I was at approximately mile post 28 near the Richmond Airport.  It was 4:14 pm.  A perfectly clear, sunny day with a gorgeous blue sky.   I assumed it was an airplane and turned for a quick look.  It is thrilling to watch the big jets cross over the highway.  Except this was not a jet.  It was round and silver/white like a perfect mylar balloon with absolutely no markings.  It was very large and was only about 200 feet above the ground.  I looked at the car next to me and as the driver passed me and saw it he pulled hard right across two lanes of traffic and stopped on the shoulder of the highway.  I slowed way down and watched as the circle dropped to about tree height and held position.  As I got closer I was anxious about driving by it but before I reached it, it pulled up a bit and quickly crossed the highway and dropped behind the trees quite rapi! dly.  The most disturbing vision was of the undeniably huge circular shadow it cast and watching that shadow move across the highway in front of me.  At least two other cars pulled over and watched.  I was too afraid to stop.  I have been trying to explain this away to myself and others since it happened but that shadow refuses to tuck itself away in my mind.;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252
White lights on unique object.;2013-03-01 05:33:00;5 minutes;White lights on unique object Dropped my husband off at the Richmond Airport & I was returning home.  I just left the airport, I was on Richmond Airport Connector Rd. heading back to I-895 when I saw what I thought was airplane light to my right.  It was too early in the morning for a plane to be flying but I thought that maybe it was a plane returning to the airport after being serviced. As I continued to watch the plane I know that the object was not heading for the airport so I figured that it was a private jet servicing one of the companies in the area.  As I watched the object it stopped and a light was bright shining down.  So now I figured that the object must be police and they were looking for something. As I came up on the object, now on my right side, I noticed that it was an object that I had never seen.  It was hovering over the trees but there was no sound and the trees did not move.  The object was round as a cylinder the inside was hallow except for two cylinders that went thru the middle.  Half way thru these two cylinders split and made a V shape.  I was near the object for about a minute, then object took off to the north east. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she seemed to us to be quite sincere.  Her description of the object was so precise and objective, we suspect that she is a very good witness.  PD));37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252

Driving home, spotted lights, thinking it was a a/c or helicopter.  It was still and quiet, with flashing lights. ((anonymous report));2018-04-05 00:00:00;5 minutes;Was driving home and spotted lights, thinking it was a airplane or helicopter.  It was still and quiet, with flashing lights.   As I drove closer in its direction, I notice the lights for brighter, then it begin to move in the same direction as me, but it had a glide like motion.  I stopped the car, then it turned around and glided in the opposite direction.  This was no airplane it helicopter.  I always thought people were ta ta in the head saying stuff like this, but now that I saw it...and someone else with me did to...seems unbelievable.;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252
Fast moving white, bright light moved across the sky - moving much faster than a plane.;2019-09-20 19:30:00;5-10 minutes;Fast moving white, bright light moved across the sky - moving much faster than a plane. On a clear night, we were sitting outside having a beer at Hardywood West Creek, when my boyfriend, dad, brother, and I noticed other patrons looking up at the sky and pointing at it.  When we got up from our table, we saw that they were looking a very white, bright light moving across the sky.  This thing was moving much faster than a plane and was not blinking. In about 3 - 5 minutes it had crossed over us and then was out of our line of sight.  There were about 10 - 15 others who saw this, and they too were stumped about what they had just seen.;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252
