Numerous flashing lights over Richmond, Virginia on September 11, 2003;2003-09-11 19:00:00;1 to 2 minutes;Numerous flashing lights over Richmond, Virginia on September 11, 2003 We were returning from a restaurant west of Richmond, Virginia.  I was in the front passenger seat and a friend was in the back seat.  My wife was driving.  It was dark and the sky was clear.  I happened to look out the passenger window and saw several flashing lights which I first thought were airplanes.  What drew my attention was that the lights seemed too erratic.  Although the pulses were steady (like that of an airplane), there was no symetry.  The flashes did not match what you would have expected on an airplane's wings, or a helicopter's.  When I leaned down further for a broader view upwards, I saw there were many lights spread across half the sky.  They were moving west to east.  I pointed them out to my wife and friend.  My friend was in the back, on the driver side.  She immediately saw the flashing lights on her side of the car.  (I am sorry to add that she also said she saw two mother ships, although I saw nothing of the kind.)  My wife could not look up because she was concentrating on the road, and saw none of this.  The sky was filled with these lights, quite far up.  There was no sound.  Although we were in a car, with plenty of traffic noise, I would have thought a fleet of planes or helicopters that large would have been heard over the engine.  The fact that it was September 11 made me wonder if it was some kind of aerial memorial for the victims of 9/11.  However, the weird pattern of the flashing lights suggested this was something far out of the ordinary.  The lights disappeared to the east.  When I got home I left a voice mail with a local television station.  I wanted to know if anyone else had seen this.  I never got a call back, and was too embarrassed to pursue the matter.;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252
A star fades into nothing and then slowly flashed ( brighter than the North Star) and fades away again 3 times changing positions.;2015-10-06 22:00:00;3 minutes;A star fades into nothing and then slowly flashed (brighter than the North Star) and fades away again 3 times changing positions. A star (no brighter than any other star) faded into nothing. 20 seconds later, in the same spot it flashed brighter than the North Star.  It was a slow flash.  About a minute later, slightly to the right, it flashed again.  It did this 2 more times.  It was not an airplane, not a satellite, not anything I can figure out.;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252
Saw an odd moving light in the night sky, blinking in an odd fashion before it disappeared.;2019-06-29 22:15:00;~10 seconds;Saw an odd moving light in the night sky, blinking in an odd fashion before it disappeared. I was stepping out to get something out of my vehicle when I noticed first what seemed like a flash of light similar to a beam from a lighthouse from the corner of my eye. I looked up into that direction, which was northward, and then I didn't see anything. Moments later, I saw a light light up in the sky moving northward. After the light was on for maybe 3 seconds it went out. I assumed it was an airplane at first oh, but I didn't see the static red light. I know the fixed red light is on all airplanes, I worked in Navy aviation so that's normally the first thing that I would see on a plane that is flying at night. After another three or four seconds having not seen the light come back on, it did again but it only remained lit for maybe another half of a second. After the light disappeared the second time, I did not see it again. I have not ever seen an aircraft where the lights acted that way, so I felt very suspicious about it. There were no clouds in the! area where I was looking at, I was able to see all of the other stars around the light that I saw. And the light appeared to be larger than the Stars, and it was a very dull yellow almost white light.;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252
