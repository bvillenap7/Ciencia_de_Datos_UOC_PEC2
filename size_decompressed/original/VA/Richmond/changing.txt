Small black object stationary high in the sky, may have split into two.;2001-06-08 20:00:00;15 minutes;Small black object stationary high in the sky, may have split into two. The object was way off in the distance, so I can't say much about its shape.  It was about 8:00pm, fairly clear skies.  My girlfriend noticed something in the sky and pointed it out to me.  It was black, as far as I could tell.. but it was so far away that I guess it could have been some other color.  Anyway, normally I would have thought it was a plane.. but it wasn't moving at all.  It was just sort of floating there.  My next thought was, must be a helicopter.  But it was much, much higher than I'd ever seen a helicopter.  Then again, I'm not an expect on helicopters, so maybe. We kept looking at it and it seemed to change shape a little.. or it was rotating so that I was seeing it from a different angle.  At one point, I _think_ I saw it split into two pieces.  The two pieces remained right next to each other, though, so it could have just been thin in the middle.  The distance may have made it seem like the parts were separate. After about 15 minutes or so, the object was so faint that we lost it. I realize my description has a lot of seemed likes and couldn't exactly tell because of the distances, but that's the best I can do.  The object wasn't zipping all over the sky or shooting out laser beams or anything.  It was just behaving in a way that didn't match what I expect planes/helicopters to do.  Not strange enough for me to yell, whoa, aliens! but strange enough to make me look for UFO sighting pages on the web.  Take that however you like.;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252
White/silver floating object over downtown sky of Richmond, Virginia, high altitude, stationary and mobile behaviors.;2001-09-06 13:28:00;12 minutes;White/silver floating object over downtown sky of Richmond, Virginia, high altitude, stationary and mobile behaviors. Observer: 29 year-old male, bachelors, masters degrees.  College course in physics and astronomy. 1. Sitting outside at downtown Richmond, Va. cafe was facing north, Sun was directly over head and slightly behind no clouds in the sky. 2. Noticed a white/silver object almost directly overhead, maybe 80 degrees north of the sun.  Looked to be a weather ballon using triangulation with pencil-tip placed in front of my right eye, I determined without a doubt that the object was completely stationary. 3. The object remained stationary for up to ten minutes, after which, it began to move southward. 4. Over the two-minute journey out of sight, the object seemed to be rotating, or gyrating, in that it slightly changed shape (as if it were a pyramid or boomerang shape and was turning over). 5. The object proceeded in its southerly direction and passed the sun to the west... but not by much.  It was still distinctly bright, even while passing in close proximity to the sun. 6. I brought this to the attention of two women sitting nearby, who acknowledged the object.;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252

I noticed in the sky directly ahead of us were 3 lights.  They lights remained still for a few minutes then began to spin counterclockwise slowly at first then the lights seemed to be spinning so fast that it appeared to be one light.   The lights seemed outline a sphere shape. The lighted sphere then moved towards the trees on our left. The sphere seemed to become a big ball of white light which proceeded to move through the trees towards the highway were we were driving.  I yelled @ my son saying don't you see the lights?!  He was not responding at all!   I don't recall what happened after that but I know we could not account for aprox 1hr and 16 mins. of missing time. I know this because of the travel time from the point we left and how long it wld take to get to were we were and there's no way it would have taken us that long, my son has a lead foot.

I watch;2009-05-18 04:18:00;30 min.;Thought I was seeing a aircraft flying towards me from south to west as  I could see 2 lights that I took for wing tip lights. I watch for a couple of minutes and noticed that it was not moving. I watch a short time until I went to retrieve my camera and upon returning within a few minutes it began to seem to  become more defined and cigar shape with what seemed to be a small trail. I took several pictures but the object was at a great distance it appeared. The sun was just breaking the horizon and all stars had disappeared but you could still plainly see this object and I live in downtown so the street lights  block out quite a bit but this seemed to shine silver and I looked  through bonoculars about this time and it seemed to emmit light from the center and expand and contract. I when inside for a minute and came out to see if I could still locate it but it had disappeared. I just walked outside to see if I possible would see it again and I believe I am seeing it again this mornng but more to the south west but still at a 10 oclock angle.I will try to get a better picture or dvd. Could it be the shuttle or space station? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252

Flying reddish &quotV&quot shape w/ moving lights over Richmond, Va.;2014-04-02 21:05:00;20 seconds;Flying reddish &quotV&quot shape w/ moving lights over Richmond, Va 	On 4/2/14, I was sitting in my backyard in Richmond, Va, with my girlfriend and her friend at about 9:00pm.  We were talking about something or other and out of the corner of my eye I noticed something strange.  At first glance I thought it was a flock of birds in a “V” formation but after I looked closer, I realized they were lights with a reddish-white glow.   There were approximately 10-12 of these lights forming the shape and the V was not a solid shape, with each light moving individually and the “V” shape was changing as well, with one side becoming longer and almost straightening out into a full line as it flew across the sky.  After I noticed it, I pointed it out immediately and the other two people witnessed it as well.  It was a clear night and the lights stood out greatly in contrast to the sky.  The entire event lasted about 20-25 seconds.   The lights came from the north-east sky and travelled of in a western direction.  The lights came overhead of us and past us and then just disappeared from sight.  They didn’t appear to move away quickly as they were before but they just simply disappeared. 	I am a business professional with a college degree and I have never experienced anything like this.  I can usually explain most things of this nature but the way this craft moved was the most inhuman thing I have ever seen.  So fluid and quiet, no sound from engines and each light in the “V” formation was moving independently with all the lights finally almost completely straightening out before disappearing. 	Definitely strange and most certainly not anything of this world.;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252
Blue light fireball shape shifted into several indescribable shapes and protrusions of light across the night sky.;2015-03-21 23:00:00;5 minutes;Blue light fireball shape shifted into several indescribable shapes and protrusions of light across the night Sky. Sitting outside in my car, talking to a friend, looking east into the night, cloudy sky, I see a light ball, almost like an indescribable low beam fluorescent foreign glowing light, on fire with blue flames, gliding slowly across the atmosphere not in a normal straight way.   It shifted shape every few seconds and had long protrusions of light coming outward every second or so in an irregular formation.   There was no actual physical aircraft that I could tell, but simply a shape shifting blue type light that changed shapes and drifted off into the west and disappeared into the horizon.

We were lucid dreaming and grabbed out of our solar plexus (stomach area)and ended up in front of a group of Grey Reticulans.  I watched them shape shift and one decided to appear before me, and pointed to my right ear.  my son was with me and saw it happen as well.  I was terrified, and started to quickly speak scripture.  I am not sure why I did that, but these beings dropped both of us as soon as I started to pray.   My son is harassed constantly.  I have had other occasions of being abducted, this was probably my 3rd abduction, his first.  However this was different, as I was able to get out of it by speaking psalms 23.  When I woke up, I was in a teepee shape in my bed...my back arched. I hit the bed so hard that I fell off the bed.  My son repeated our experience to a T, as he was with me.   I have also been taken with an ex marine whom has the same sun and moon sign as me, as well as a very similar natal chart.  These are d! emons.  There is nothing good in this situation.  I have connected it to CERN.  It has happened in August 3 times for me in my life, and it is only getting worse.  It happens around the retrograde.  There was also a violet flame light frequency.  Our electricity went out after that.;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252
This tight shape fanned out into 6 to 7 individual dimly lit red lights in a downward V-shaped formation traveling horizontally.;2020-09-28 21:00:00;5-10 seconds;This tight shape fanned out into 6 to 7 individual dimly lit red lights in a downward V-shaped formation traveling horizontally. In my backyard beside a small fire I sat reclined in a chair staring up into the night. Out of the corner of the South East sky I noticed the silhouette of what I thought was a large bird (probably an owl) As I stood up telling my wife to look, the shape swooped down pulling in tightly accelerating in an arching motion back into the horizontal direction it was going. As it did this it fanned out into 6 to 7 individual dimly lit red lights in a downward V-shaped formation. These red lights despite being very dim were consistent in their color, light shade and even direction. Behind each light was a dark trail. There was absolutely no sound. It lasted for only a few seconds before the trees blocked my view. I worked on air craft for 8 years in the military and I have never seen anything like this. definitely not fireworks;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252
Indeterminable Orb In Early Morning Sky, Richmond VA;2021-02-25 06:15:00;Seconds;Indeterminable Orb In Early Morning Sky, Richmond VA So we leave in the morning around 6:15 to take my youngest to school, and as we were crossing thecChamberlayne Avenue bridge towards Leigh Street, I saw a HUGE ball of bright white light, which shape shifted and at times appeared to be a six-point star. If you saw how big Saturn was during the Great Conjunction two months ago...this flash was easily four or five times bigger. I fumbled with my phone to get a decent shot and video in, but I'm not very good at that. Then, the light suddenly disappeared, like, burnt out, to reveal what at first appeared to be a regular Earthly aircraft, with flashing red lights. But looking more closely, it was also a strange-looking aircraft, weirdly elongated, the red light looked long as well, as opposed to a pinpoint of light. But what really got me was how painstakingly slow it moved, almost lingering. Veeerrrryy weird. Even my three-year-old looked up, pointed, and said look Mommy, a spaceship!;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252

As we were sitting in my truck, me, my two kids, and my cousin witnessed 10 small yellow objects flying from the same direction as if they were in military form. As they went by, we could see a bright blue light flash with an object that appeared to be in the center. The object appeared to be changing form for 30 seconds and then it disappeared. While the object changed forms I could see on my recording once I zoomed in on it that there appeared to be light or sound waves coming from the object in the center of the bright light.;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252
