I watched as it streaked East-West extremely fast and and it finaly was between our car and huge buildings(downtown Richmond) and only several hundred feet away.  It hovered for awile and then it was gone in a flash.  It was not Fixed, Rotary, or any other known flying craft I know of!  22 years in Aviation Industry! I was heading back to my post with friends and family when visiting in PA and was retuning to Camp Lejuene NC as I was an active duty Marine.  We were heading southbound on Interstate very late in the evening.  The vehicle was a 1965 Chev. with a sloped back window.  I was a passenger in the back with my wife and my friend and his wife and sleeping young son was in the front.  I leaned my head back, and saw what appeared to be a bright object moving swiftly across the sky and doing erratic right angle fast turning manuevers at 1st I thought it may be a reflection, so I rolled the window down to get a better look and saw that it was in fact something in the sky!  Well, it ws cold so I immediately got objections from all the other passengers!  But I continued tracking it and saw that it was getting much closer and following a similar path path as we were!  At it's closest point it was less than 300' to my left and was totaly clearly visable as a saucer shaped craft!  Up to that point in my life I did not have any desciption or drawing of what I saw, since then I have seen T.V. programs, movies and Newspaper descriptions of what others saw since then that summed up what I saw.  I grew up just below the flight path for final approach for Philadelpia Intl Airport, and was always around military aircraft during my military career, I know beyond a shadow of any doubt, that what I witnessed was in fact not of this earth's technology! It was silver metalic with red bands and a white(bright) area and was very stable and deliberate in it's movements!  We definetely ar not alone, I will testify to any and all statements made here to anyone!  Also, while going through my basic training at Parris Is. SC in the time frame of Sept-Dec.'73, we were put on the alert...for real!, to report any objects that were sighted as the public/military had sighted a few objects in nearby Charleston, SC.  This was front page news.  I do not know if my sighting was ever documented and i don't even know where to begin to find out, but if somehow another report similar to mine ever comes across your research...I would love to know about it!  I want to that you immensly for you creating this forum...it is a great site, and I will send$ to support your efforts in this endeavor!;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252

Two craft flew slowly parallel for two minutes, then one stayed the course,the other veered off, sunlight gleaming off it`s side. Seeme;1999-05-04 17:45:00;4 min.;Two craft flew slowly parallel for two minutes, then one stayed the course,the other veered off, sunlight gleaming off it`s side. Seemed to be 3-4 miles away, and flew slower than the planes around them. I felt compelled to look at the sky, and then I saw them and watched as they glided away. The objects were metallic, similar in size and rate of speed, and made no noise. This is my 3rd UFO sighting in my 30 years in VA.;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252
I saw a big tilted dark gray saucer-like object moving slowly in the night sky.;2010-05-01 23:30:00;3-5 minutes.;I saw a big tilted dark gray saucer-like object moving slowly in the night sky. The object I saw was a very dark gray, saucer-like object that was tilted moving slowly to the right in the sky (roughly 500+ feet up). It was a bit more jagged than the normal “saucer” with a slight rectangle/diamond design. There were no lights of any kind on the object but there was a slight haze around the entire thing. I watched it hover in the sky, for roughly 3-5 mins before I completely lost track of it.  I don’t drink, smoke, do drugs, take any medication, and I don’t wear glasses or contacts. While I do believe in other life forms out in space, I’m not one to believe UFO sightings or abductions. There were trees in my view but the object was above them so they didn’t cause any problems. This event did happen at night around 11:30PM but I was wide awake.  I’m honestly blown away by what I witnessed tonight I couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw. I’m not normally one to jump to conclusions or anything but I felt it deep within me that this was not a normal aircraft. I still can’t believe I actually witness this event, whenever anyone asks me about ghosts, etc. I tell them, I believe they MIGHT exist but I will never say they do till I witness it for myself. Well tonight, I witnessed a UFO sighting.;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252

UFO Found in Moon Pictures;2011-04-14 20:00:00;1 minute;UFO Found in Moon Pictures On 4/4/2011, I was shooting some sunset pictures on Nuckols Farm during a walk with my wife and son. Couple minutes after the sunset, I found the half moon was bright then started shooting the moon and some street lights at Nuckols Farm Elementary School, 12351 Graham Meadows Drive, Richmond, VA 23233-6619. At one moment while I was adjusting my camera, I felt there was a star below the moon.  However, when the shutter had already closed, I could not see that object any more.  Then I magnified my picture. Very surprisingly, it was an UFO!  Right after that, I tried to search it out with a zoom lens and ended up with nothing.  Several minutes later, I showed this picture to some guys playing on the ground.  They were my neighbors in the same community. I also searched three other pictures taken couple seconds before that picture.  There was seemingly something on them but very dark. In the attachment, I put in the full size picture with all EXIF data for your analysis.  My camera’s time was not right.  The actual time of that picture (compared to my cell phone after that), should be 20:00:35, 4/14/2011. Thank you for your attention on this report.  Pictures were sent through e-mail.;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252

UFO disc reflecting sun while hovering silently north of Richmond, VA.;2018-07-09 14:10:00;1 minute;UFO disc reflecting sun while hovering silently north of Richmond, VA My girlfriend and I saw what we believe was a shiny metallic disc-shaped UFO while driving our car on I-295 west while exiting onto I-95 south outside Richmond, VA, at 2:10 p.m., Monday, July 9, 2018.  I was driving my girlfriend to her doctor's appointment.  Our sighting lasted about one minute or less.  While slowing to exit from one interstate highway to another I noticed what appeared to be a metallic saucer-shaped craft high in the air.  The craft was north of our position at about 45 degrees above the horizon.  I estimate the altitude may have been 10,000-15,000 feet (higher than a light prop plane but lower than a cruising airliner).  At the time there was a sunny clear-blue sky to the north without clouds and unlimited visibility.  There were clouds to the south but they were not a factor.  I watched the craft trying to determine whether it might be an airplane but there was absolutely no discernible movement, nor were there any FAA lights, markings, noise or! vapor trails.  The disc was hovering and reflecting the sunlight.   I'm 58 years old, BS with honors, am familiar with military and civilian spacecraft and aircraft, meteorology, astronomy, and relatives from NASA, NSA, and Army helicopters.  This craft did not appear to be one of ours.   After deciding for myself that the craft in question might very well be an extraterrestrial vehicle rather than a man-made aircraft, I pointed it out to my girlfriend.  She observed the shiny hovering disc for about 15 seconds and came to the same conclusion.  My girlfriend also is mature, college degreed, and the owner/operator of an online store.  We both watched the disc hover, seemingly motionless, reflecting the sun, and then it appeared to vanish into thin air without a trace.   We scanned the clear-blue sky but the saucer apparently cloaked itself, raced off in the blink of an eye, and/or perhaps disappeared into another dimension of time/space.  We did not see or hear a! ny man-made aircraft in the sky in that direction at the time of our disc sighting.  Only the shiny metallic saucer-shaped craft.  No clouds, airplanes or helicopters.  However, both of us heard a military jet fighter roar over our house at approximately 10 a.m. the same day, about four hours before we saw the UFO disc.   We live in rural King William County about 30 minutes northeast of where we saw the disc. We have seen many black unmarked helicopters over our property, and occasional jets, especially in conjunction with other resident's UFO reports, but I believe this was the first jet fighter in a few months and we found it noteworthy since the fighter plane was monitoring our area a few hours before we saw the UFO. Just a coincidence?  There is an Army base with heliports and airstrips controlled by the NSA, including secret underground tunnels, about 30 minutes northwest of our home but the aforementioned chopper and jet-fighter flights are not routine and nearly always coincide with MUFON/NUFORC reports by other local! witnesses.  My girlfriend and I believe the ETs are mostly benign and it's the shadow government and military/industrial/intelligence complex that people should be concerned about.  We believe the ETs probably monitor the shadow government facilities and vice versa.  We believe the latter information and opinion is relevant and should be considered in conjunction with our possible extraterrestrial disc sighting because of the unusual jet fighter roaring over our house the same day.  Note: Our shiny, reflective UFO disc sighting outside Richmond, VA occurred on the afternoon of July 9, 2018, and I reported it to the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) on the morning of July 10, 2018 (MUFON case 93248).    Then on the morning of July 15, 2018 I discovered a NUFORC case from Springfield, VA, about a shiny, reflective possible UFO disc seen in the daytime on July 8, 2018, but posted to NUFORC on July 13, 2018.  The NUFORC case reminded me of our Richmond sighting first reported to ! MUFON.  Bottom line:  Someone in Northern Virginia near Washington, D.C, saw a possible UFO disc during the day on July 8 and then my girlfriend and I saw a possible UFO disc during the day outside Richmond (120 miles south of D.C.) on July 9, and a military fighter jet made an unusual pass over our rural home on July 9 about four hours before we saw the disc-shaped UFO.  All just a coincidence?;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252

3 flying saucers.;2019-10-06 06:50:00;10 seconds;3 flying saucers I was in my bedroom in my apartment and decided to peek out the bay window we have, not even 5 seconds later I see a very round cloud but I notice this is no cloud because it was perfectly saucer shaped.  It flew north over a bank of america building then disappeared shortly after, after the first one disappeared a second saucer, that was a darker grey then the first one, took the same path as the first one and disappeared.  Then came a third one.  The third one was the same color as the second one, but instead of just disappearing, it morphed into a spiral, tornado like shape before also disappearing.;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252
