Sphere...silver...shiny....spotted in western Henrico County (Richmond, VA);1998-08-02 23:30:00;several minutes;Sphere...silver...shiny....spotted in western Henrico County (Richmond, VA) There was plenty of moonlight, and I was looking at a star in the sky, when something out of the corner of my eye caught my attention.  A round ball...silver colored...came silently and swiftly into view. It wasn't very high in the sky...just above the treetops. It appeared to be unaffected by air currents because it simply moved in a straight line from left to right, and a bit ahead. (I was facing south or south-west).  Though it had no light(s) of its own, the shiny silver ball was quite easy to see in the bright moonlight. It was going much too fast and too straight to be a child's balloon.;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252
3 Spheres trailing behind passenger airliner;2005-01-15 15:00:00;45 seconds;3 Spheres trailing behind passenger airliner This sighting occured on a clear, sunny day in the afternoon in Richmond's West End.   I just stepped outside with my bassett hound on her leash.  I noticed a passenger airliner flying very low in the sky heading roughly southeasterly in direction.  The plane was in my direct field of vision and VERY close.   It was then I witnessed three white or silver spheres emerge from behind the airliner headed in a slightly different direction (east), but much more slowly.  They appeared to be extremely close to fuselage.  I immediately stopped in my tracks and began to observe intently.   Two were very close together with one trailing behind somewhat.  They were lined up in a line parallel to the ground.  I could see something black swirling around them every few seconds.  They made absolutely no sound.  I watched them proceed eastward until they left my sight.  I have never seen anything like this.   I have a background in the Air Force and I spent several years in western states that are considered hotbeds for UFO activity.  Never seen anything like this before.

4 shining spheres spotted over river for 20 minutes;2010-12-31 04:30:00;30 Minutes;4 shining spheres spotted over river for 20 minutes While crossing a bridge over the James River in a car, 4 large spheres were spotted in the sky hovering in a diamond formation. These spheres were all metallic colored and were shining in the sunlight.  Myself, along with 2 associates pulled over the car to examine the objects. We tried to call some friends but all of our cell phones had shut down.  The crafts also made a slight buzzing sound.  We viewed these objects for about 15 minutes, as they hovered above the river.  As quickly as they arrived, they immediately sped off into the horizon.;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252

Very low glowing red orb came towards me and stopped for a few seconds.;2013-08-27 20:37:00;0.6;Very low glowing red orb came towards me and stopped for a few seconds. I was walking when I noticed a red glowing orb that appeared just above the tree line then slowly moved towards me then stopped for a couple seconds.  Then it started changing directions while it was moving straight up until it disappeared.   I tried to take a pic when it was close but my camera could not seem to focus on it.  As it was moving up my camera was able focus and snap a pic.  It made no sound at all.;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252
UFO above highway with yellow orange lights;2015-04-22 23:30:00;12 seconds;UFO above highway with yellow orange lights Seen ufo in the sky when entering the highway right off Laburnum Ave in Richmond, VA.  I believe the object was sphere shaped.  It was really hard to tell because the left side of the ufo was slightly dark and the right side was a yellowish orange color.   The color looked like it was moving in a motion like a flying saucer would but becomes dark on the left side of the object.   The object was at a pretty good distance above the highway and then at a 45 degree angle the object zoomed off within 2 sec and disappeared.   2 other cars were on the highway as well in front of me but I'm not sure if they actually paid attention to it.
