sighted 09/28/2001 no noise Richmond, Va. at 11:00 PM 2-3 minutes duration going west to east  shape of a sailor's cap;2001-09-28 23:00:00;2-3 minutes;sighted 09/28/2001 no noise Richmond, Va. at 11:00 PM 2-3 minutes duration going west to east  shape of a sailor's cap March 24, 2008   Dear Sir:  I have been a little hesitant to report a sighting two friends and I had some time back.       This sighting took place on Friday night September 28, 2001.   I might also add that one of the friends with me was an active FBI agent and also the driver of the vehicle. We were coming out of Richmond, Virginia at approximately 11:00 PM on the above date when we approached exit 58 on the southbound side of Interstate 95. On one side to the west is state route 150 with high tension electrical lines on the east running parallel to I-95 and (under construction at the time) to the west is  Interstate 895 overpass. We sighted a very odd flying object going from west to east.  What was strange about this is that the object had come in UNDER the electrical lines and was lit up in very bright white lights. The shape was that of a sailor’s cap. This object couldn’t have been 75 feet overhead. The vehicle was maybe 25 feet square and10-12 feet tall.  We had pulled onto the side of the road to watch this spectacle which had also attracted the attention of several vehicles on the northbound side of I-95. The object hovered over the roadway’s columns for a few minutes and then very slowly headed east. I have seen pictures of lots of different shapes of UFOs, but I have never seen or heard of anything like this. Do you have any ideas? We didn’t have a camera or video camera to take pictures of this. All three of us have discussed this several times and agree to what we saw.;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252
Star-like object that zig zaged, moved in different directions (diagonally), and had no constant speed.;2002-05-29 22:09:00;20 to 30 seconds;Star-like object that zig zaged, moved in different directions (diagonally), and had no constant speed. The object seen around ten o' clock at night looked like a star, but it could be seen that it was closer than the appearing stars in the background when looking at the object.  If not careful, it could be confused with a satellite but the difference is that this object zig zaged and did not have a constant speed.  It moved from side to side too and sped up sometimes.  It would slow down and then increase speed all of a suden and then slow down again.  A similar object was seen about an hour and ten minutes later that behaved similar to the first object seen.  It was indeed an extraordinary sighting.;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252
Red and Silver Object Viewed Shortly After Take-off from Richmond International Airport;2006-03-29 18:50:00;10 seconds;Red and Silver Object Viewed Shortly After Take-off from Richmond International Airport We had just taken off from RIC and had not quite reached 10,000 feet when just outside the port side of the airplane I noticed a silver and red object in a stationary position. The distance from our aircraft to the object is unknown, but it was close enough to see some detail. The object was vertical in orientation with a long, antenna-like object on top with multiple array and wide, round center body and an even longer cylindrical rod (?) protruding out of the bottom of the object.  It appeared as though the object needed the bottom portion of to maintain balance, though that it speculative on my part, as the object did not appear to be moving. I had been looking out the window and noticed the object right away and as we climbed it remained in a fixed position.  As we climbed it fell out of my view. It almost looked as though it should have been attached to a tether on the ground, except none were visible. Interestingly, shortly before take-off from RIC, 2 F-16's from the Virginia Air National Guard landed and shortly before take-off, a Navy E-2C Hawkeye was practicing touch and go's at the airport.

December 10th object seen in Richmond, Virginia.  ((NUFORC Note:  Missile venting fuel in space.  PD));2007-12-10 18:45:00;20 minutes;December 10th object seen in Richmond, Virginia Hello, I also saw the December 10th object in the sky over Chesterfield county outside Richmond, VA.  It was very high, looked almost like a comet it had a wide tail, it also had a white speck at what would seem the front. Although you think it would head in the direction the tail shows, it moved against itself. I also got my girlfriend (20) my friend (23) and his dad (55) to come look at it. I continued by myself to further view it with my binoculars thats when i realized it was traveling strange. It moved in directions it shouldn't have, I've seen some things in the sky but this was by far the strangest, man-made or not. Hope its posted here what it was, if we ever figure out.

Bright Pulsating RED U.F.O. and Multi-Spectrum U.F.O..;2014-07-04 21:00:00;30-35 minutes;Bright Pulsating RED U.F.O. and Multi-Spectrum U.F.O. Whilst spending July 4th with my fiance, we heard fire works going on a few blocks from where I lived.  When we went outside to go look at them before she left, we saw the fireworks briefly stop for a minute and A HUGE red pulsating light a few thousand feet up near the area of my house, popped up out of nowhere and slowly moved around almost like an observing pattern.  Then immediately stops on a dime, slowly moves again, stops on a dime, but when it finally moved again, it vanishes.   I shrug it off an think it's a helicopter or a blimp that had random lights on it, so I head in my car and start driving down a long road near my neighborhood and see the exact SAME object 5-10 miles away (Estimated by draw distance) pop up again and do the same thing but this time it's pulsating a bright red aura.  I call the TSA (Transportation Security Administration) and they had no idea what kind of object it was, nor had anything in relation to what was described! as this vehicle and so they gave me the number to this website.   If you're reading this I also have additional info on a Multi-Spectrum U.F.O. seen a couple months ago as well along side with this bright RED U.F.O..;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252
Slow, low floating triangular orbs, self-obscured, self generated cloud.;2016-06-04 10:00:00;5 minutes;Slow, low floating triangular orbs, self-obscured, self generated cloud. The kids were playing their Saturday morning soccer game.  One parent said, Look at that cloud.  It was dark and small and much lower than the overcast ceiling of around 3000 ft.   It was floating westward then abruptly changed direction and floated back toward our field,southward.  It stayed around 500 ft as it moved and was about the size of a house.  In it were 3 or 4 objects, partially obscured.   It was VERY distinctive.  It was not natural.  One parent said that it is retaining a triangular shape.  Many of us took pictures.  One lady said she thought it best not to. LOL!  I told her she was probably right.;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252
