The huge, silent craft seemed not use aerodynamics like planes too huge, too slow to remain aloft.;1990-01-23 20:00:00;1 minute;The huge, silent craft seemed not use aerodynamics like planes too huge, too slow to remain aloft. I was traveling in my car North on Glenside Drive in Henrico County, & was stopped at the light at Broad Street. While I was stopped, I noticed a red light appear over a ridge of trees (the trees are about 60 feet high,) there appeared to be a triangular shape of dense black following the first red light. I then saw a red light at the points of what became a triangular shaped aircraft. As the craft slowly glided overhead, I realized that it was about 300-400 feet long, triangular in shape, seemed not to reflect light, rather absorb it, and the shape was defined by the dense blackness that was darker than the night sky above it. I got out of my car to ask someone else in another car what they thought. There were no other cars at the 12-way intersection. (It is a very busy intersection, usually.) The craft glided silently overhead, disappearing behind a ridge of trees (also about 60 feet tall,) near some radio towers. ((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous.  Date may be approximate.

Floating triangle seen over Richmond.;2002-06-19 21:05:00;about 3 min.;Floating triangle seen over Richmond. While I was driving home in my pickup truck from my job at a gas station in Richmond when I saw a triangle of lights green, yellow, and blue. Thinking it was an airplane I just kept driving but when I noticed it didn't really move or make noise I kept my eyes on it. It was partly cloudy so it would dissapear in a cloud for a few seconds and then re-appear shortly after. When I got home I looked into the sky to see if it was there but it wasn't.

Object had triangular lights 3 bright one chnge in to 120 degree and disappear.;2003-08-27 20:30:00;30-35sec;Object had triangular lights 3 bright one chnge in to 120 degree and disappear. While I was going on the road that I travel all the time and being working before for an airline I am sure of it that, what I saw was not the plane. It was crossing over the road i was passing it look like three lights like a triange and it was too slow  no noise coming from the UFO. It took apx 30-45 sec to go and then lights disappear. So it can't be the plane. When i open my window look it was changing light location from triangle to 120 degree angle ligts when passed. Same vinicity in few minutes aircraft passed same route and it made noice as well it passed pretty fast crossed the road i was on in 2 seconds.

A V-shaped formation of triangles moving across the sky;2003-11-08 21:30:00;20 seconds;A V-shaped formation of triangles moving across the sky My girlfriend and I were out looking at the lunar eclipse when a wedge shaped formation of triangular shaped objects passed between us and the moon.  They appeared to be fairly close to the ground, they were moving without sound, and they reflected light from the street.  Our first thought was that we were seeing a flight of geese, but then we noticed that the objects were reflecting light.  My girlfriend thought they may have been fireworks, but there was no concussion, streams of light, arc of trajectory, or anything else that would indicate a typical firework pattern.  The wedge formation moved away from our line of sight rather quickly and disappeared towards the eastern part of the city without a sound.;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252
Two triangular shaped craft with white and red lights going Northeast.;2004-10-01 20:27:00;5 Minutes;Two triangular shaped craft with white and red lights going Northeast. I am an Army (Officer),and Navy (air) veteran and am now working for the Department of Defense. I have accredited BS and MS degrees and assure you that this is true. I do not smoke inside my home. I took a smoke break outside about 20:30. It was dark outside and the sky was clear backlit by the lights from the city of Richmond. I am about 10 miles from the airport so it is not unusual to see planes in the distance.  I noticed through the trees what appeared to be stationary lights in the sky. After observing for several minutes, the lights started to move toward me from the West to East. It passed almost directly overhead at about 500 feet. There were two crafts. Both were shaped like triangles. The lead craft had two outboard white strobing lights and a light on the front. It also had what looked like fluffy whit lights inboard of the strobes. These were definitely not FAA regulation navigation beacons. The second craft had the triangular shape following below the first and to the rear of the first craft. This one only had a red light in the middle of its silhouette. There was absolutely no noise. They were proceeding very slowly and eventually turned North in the distance. The local newspapers later reported that strange lights were seen in the sky. This is the first time I have told this story. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Object forming a perfect triangle of lights, unidentifiable.;2005-11-15 22:10:00;2 minutes;Object forming a perfect triangle of lights, unidentifiable. I was driving home from work and saw something that at first struck me as odd, but I wrote it off as a plane.   It was moving very slowly.  It was at a distance, so I figured the triangular shape was just the nose and wing lights.   When I parked the car and got out it was flying almost directly overhead and I could hear no sound.  I looked for the blinking tail light, then realized it had a light in the front and one where each wing would be, plus a light inbetween them.   There's nothing 'in between' on a plane.  There was no tail light, only another two or three light between what I thought was the wing lights.  It was a perfect triangle.  I tried to follow it through the overhead trees, but lost it.;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252
Triangle of lights traveling SSW to NNE.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of U. S. Navy NOSS triplet of satellites??  PD));2006-05-21 21:55:00;Approx 1 Minute;Triangle of lights traveling SSW to NNE We were observing planets with my 10 scope and attempting to pick up satallite passages.  While attempting unsuccessfully to observe the orbit of the Cosmos 2369 rocket scheduled to travel SSW to NNE and exit our field of vision at about 21:50 and looking to the NNE, suddenly observed directly overhead this triangular formation of lights traveling in approximately the same direction at a relatively rapid rate of speed. It was a stunning sight and I hurredly called it to the attention of my companion. The formation proceeded in the direction of VEGA, passed to the west of it, veered off to the East and disappeared from our view. The formation was about the size of my hand held at arms length. It was impossible to determine its height. There was no sound at any point. It consisted of about 6-8 indivdual lights. The lights were not spots, but vertical with a slight bulge in the middle. The formation was somewhat triangular, vertical on its left side and sloping slightly outward on the right side. It was traveling wide end or bottom forward. There was no variance in spacing or intensity of the lights nor variation in speed. The night was clear with no haze or cloud cover. The phenomena appeared as if it could have been produced by a searchlight but there was no cover upon which it could have been reflected and no variation in the light as would be seen if on cloud or haze cover. The light was soft and about a 1 in intensity. It did not reappear. There was no airplane traffic in the area prior to, during, or until some time after the sighting. No object per se was observable.

Possible triangle craft spotted in Richmond VA;2009-11-01 18:30:00;1.5 minutes;Possible triangle craft spotted in Richmond VA I am 14 years old, and I also hold a 2nd Degree Black Belt in Tae Kwon Do. On the way home from T.K.D. lessons, we had stopped in a traffic jam next to a high school football field. I peered out the window to get a better look at the traffic, and in the sky I saw 4 lights in a triangular formation 3 white lights in each corner of the triangle and a single red light in the center. It was dark, and all I could tell from the lights were that they did not flash or blink in any way. I know that there were some power lines around, but if there was a solid object behind those lights, it was enormous. I'm sure others saw it, but I can't be sure. The craft did move, at a speed I estimate to be about 5 mph. I know that this was not the illusion created from the moving car, as I saw it move even when we were stopped. I didn't bother to tell my mom and sister, as they would just think I was joking. I've heard of the theorized TR-3B Government UFO, and I think that what I saw might bear a resemblance to the infamous Black Triangle. The lights were still there, even after the traffic started to pick up again. The next day, we took the same route to and from Tae Kwon Do lessons. On the way to our lesson, I looked at the spot in the sky where I had spotted the 3 lights. There was nothing like a cellphone, VOR or radio tower in the vicinity. On the way home, I looked in the sky and the lights weren't there. This still remains a mystery to me, and I'm still investigating this incident.

9-10 circular lights in triangle formation off Chamberlayne exit RICHMOND, VA.;2013-05-16 01:00:00;~30 seconds;9-10 circular lights in triangle formation off Chamberlayne exit RICHMOND, VA. Exiting off 95 north onto Chamberlayne for gas around 1 am, and saw maybe 9 or 10 white/yellow lights evenly distributed in a triangle formation hovering over Exxon across the street.   Pulled into Sunoco, got out and watched for around 30 seconds to a minute.  Unfortunately, I was unable to tell distance or size of craft.  If I had to guess, I would say it was somewhere high over Parham Rd.   Motion was minimal but present, best described as 'floating'.  There were no blinking marker lights and no sound emitted, completely silent from my location.    I unfortunately don't recall exact details of how it pulled away, exit was fast and behind the trees away from where I was.  No witnesses.

Multiple Triangular Craft over Richmond, Virginia.;2013-09-24 20:30:00;30 minutes;Multiple Triangular Craft over Richmond, Virginia My son was walking the dog and came into the house to tell me he saw UFOs.  We went out in the backyard and for a twenty minute period we witnessed approximately 50 triangular objects with blinking lights flying overhead in a northeasterly direction.  There were two to five visible at any given time over this period. They were not directly over our heads, but as we looked NE, some were to our left, and some were to our right.  We could turn to the SE and pick out new ones, and follow them as they flew out of sight to the NE. We think they were triangular because they generally had three lights.  The lights allowed us to see the solidity of the objects.  The objects were moving in the direction of a side of the triangle a point of the triangle was in the rear.  The rearmost light was blinking while the front two were steady.  There seemed to be more than just the three lights that defined the triangle. Their flight was straight and steady.  A single object would take about four minutes or so from initial sighting in the SE to going out of sight in the NE.;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252
Large black triangle with red lights, hovering very low over national box-store.;2015-01-11 18:30:00;1 minute;Large black triangle with red lights, hovering very low over national box-store. Driving home at dusk, I saw a very large black triangular craft.  It was hovering at low altitude in the middle of a suburban shopping area, right outside of the City of Richmond.  I was smoking a cigarette so the window was down, but I heard nothing out of the ordinary.  This object was completely silent.  I got a very good look at it when stopped at a traffic light.  It was hovering right over a national box-store, at no more than twice the hight of the building itself. This triangular craft was immense!  If I had to estimate its size, I’d say it was at least that of a football field, if not larger.  It was an isosceles triangle, black in color, except for seven red circular lights on the underside of the craft.  Each vertex had a large-sized light, and there was another at the triangle’s center.  From this larger center light there ran a row of three smaller red lights, down to the unequal side’s edge. It was astounding to see this extraordinary object juxtaposed on a perfectly typical, American landscape scene.  Its been tough to forget this, and I've yet to rationalize what I saw as being anything other than a UFO.  Thus I figured it was time to submit my report.;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252

I was very high in the sky and a great distance from where we sat, but there was a clear triangular formation of the lights.;2019-09-20 17:00:00;4 minutes;I can only choose this date because I have noticed a similar posting for this day regarding this sighting. This was a warm afternoon and I was sitting on my porch talking to my roommate. I live in Oregon Hill and while she was talking, I became very still and fixated on a formation of lights in the distance, south of my house beyond the river. There were three lights in a triangle, I mostly remember one being red and another green because it was striking against the blue sky. It was before the sun set that night. I had to interrupt the conversation because I could not focus on what we were talking about due to my interest in this form. I pointed it out to her, and we mutually concluded that it was a ufo.  Moments after we still somehow returned to our conversation. I watched it a little longer but did not recall when it had disappeared. There is an airport in that direction, but we rarely see a plane nearing the location I noticed. I was very high in the sky and a great distance from where we sat, but there was a clear triangular formation of the lights. Seeing that someone had posted something like what I experienced really validated what we had seen.  I have never seen a green light involved on any other aircraft before this day.;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252
Triangle Shaped UFO Sighted in Richmond.;2019-09-20 18:40:00;2 minutes;Triangle Shaped UFO Sighted in Richmond. Walked outside to let my dog pee- huge triangle shaped object with like 30 lights all blinking flying low.  Craziest thing I've seen in my life- was metallic gray but had different colored blinking lights. A lot of them were white but some were green and yellow.  Heading south- it looked like it went right over where the Richmond race way would be.  The race track is so loud- even though I am a few miles from it I can still hear the car engines and it is hard to tell if the object was making a sound.  The day was turning to night but the sky was still very blue as the sun had not quite set yet.;37.531359506173;-77.4717913580252
