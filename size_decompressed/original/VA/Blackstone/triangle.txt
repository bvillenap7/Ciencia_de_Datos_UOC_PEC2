My friend and I were coming home last night about 22:00 at which time I saw 3 Large Headlights (if you will).  They were in a triangular shape, appearing to be one unit.  There was only darkness between these lights.  We could not determine an actual craft, but it was definitely one unit.  The craft was above the treeline when I spotted it, my friend tried to keep track of the craft (I was driving).  It was on the left of us when we first saw it, then crossed to the right after we passed it.  It seemed to be hovering.  At this point we lost sight of the craft.  We continued maybe 2 miles down the road and again the craft was in front of us.  At this time it was hovering above a field facing us.  I slowed the car almost to a stop, my window was partially down and absolutely no sound could be heard.  At the urging of my friend, I continued down the road.  (we were almost in town at this point)  When my friend turned around to see where the craft had gone, it had disappeared.  This was a trully strange event.  I'm curious if anyone else in the area witnessed this and would like to know if there is an explanation of this.  As we discussed this, the one thing that really stands out would be the lights on this craft.  I have never seen this type of light before.;37.0886;-77.9819
