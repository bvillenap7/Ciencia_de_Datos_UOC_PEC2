Fast moving lights over the Virginia Sky;2000-06-26 22:35:00;2 minutes;Fast moving lights over the Virginia Sky While on duty with the Army National Guard at Fort Pickett, Va, My three friends and I were stargazing in the woods.  We found Polaris, and then Pegasus, and looked about one o'clock from the latter and watched a light zig zag diagonally towards pegasus cut to the right, and then back towards Pegasus and disappear.  Two days prior I saw another one moving across the sky from right to left way faster than any object I'd ever seen move until it dissapeared over the horizon.;37.0886;-77.9819
