Strange orange ball hovered near military base.;2014-07-19 23:15:00;15-20 minutes;Strange orange ball hovered near military base. About 11:15 on July 19, 2014, I saw a orange ball just above the tree line.  I watched it for about 2 mins and it dropped down slowly behind the tree line towards Fort Picket military base.   About two miles away there is a small access rd that runs along side the base around where we saw the object descend.   As we were parked along side the rd with our lights off, the sky started to pulsate just beyond the tree line, and a few mins later, the fireball flew parallel to the tree line really fast, and shot up on a very sharp angle and was out of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  We attempted to contact the source of the report, in order to clarify the time of the sighting, but could not reach him via the contact information he provided to NUFORC.  We suspect that the sighting occurred at night, and we have amended the time above.;37.0886;-77.9819
