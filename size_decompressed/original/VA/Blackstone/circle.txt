I slowed down to a stop and the craft hovered slowly towards me.  I opened the door to get out of the vehicle as it was nearing behind me, and in a blink, it was gone, almost as if it just blended into the background like a camouflage.  I have never seen one before or since that night.;37.0886;-77.9819
