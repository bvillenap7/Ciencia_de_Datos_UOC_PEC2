Bright light coming closer and then disappearing;2001-07-01 00:30:00;10-15 seconds;Bright light coming closer and then disappearing I was on firewatch at Marine Corps Officer Candidate School and was looking out the window of the squad bay sometime between 2400 and 0100.  I saw a light in the distance.  At first I thought it was a star because it did not move, but then it started moving off towards the right, but then seemed to get closer (or at least a lot brighter).  After maybe 5 seconds it quickly faded and then completely disappeared.  It was a clear night and visibility was pretty far, but it couldn't have been more than a quarter mile away when it vanished. ((NUFORC Note:  We are not certain whether the event occurred near midnight on June 30, July 01, or July 02nd.  Time and date indicated by the witness are ambiguous.  PD));38.5304;-77.3345
