At 23:01 on Tuesday, April 16th, 2019, a brightly lit, green object was witnessed by this author moving rapidly from the eastern sky toward the south, dropping at approximately 45 degrees throughout the duration of said object's flight, as if it were landing.   The object, which was triangular in shape, specifically scaline, with the longest edge facing the sky, was illuminated with a green light, and it appeared the whole craft was lit, rather than having any artificial lighting.   Furthermore, there was a long, orange trail that dragged behind the object, which was noticeable also throughout the visual until the object disappeared behind the tree line.;39.0544;-78.1156
