A  silver circle shaped disk with a dome on top and a shield that opened and closed in a cloud on a sunny day in Warrenton Virginia;1991-06-01 18:00:00;5 Mins;A  silver circle shaped disk with a dome on top and a shield that opened and closed in a cloud on a sunny day in Warrenton Virginia My name is Mrs. Leslie Kalen at the time of the event my name was Leslie Carol Pullin. I am 49 years old and a very sucessful Investor and Buisness Owner. My fortune came after we sold my fathers Company that I started with him. It was called Command Technologies, Inc located in Warrenton Va. It sold about 6 years ago. We were a  Military Defense Co. with Miltary contracts. My fathers name is Major Donald Rose. I was the FSO and Director of Security for several years. I received my training at DOD in Richmond Va. I held a TS Clearance. A report was filed through I think this site at the time it occurred. The date may be 1992. A report was filed and came back with no explanation. My father told me to leave it alone and I did. But not till I told enough people.. The old report shows this remark made from my father. I need to know if anyone else has ever saw the same thing. 1991-1992  1800  Leaving work at Command Technologies in Warrenton Virginia which is located next to Vint Hill Military Base ( which is closed now ) I pick up my young son an head towards Culpeper Virgina which is about 30 mins away and home. I was only about 10 mins in the travel before entering onto the highway . It was a bright sunny warm day the sun was in front of me. Their where very few white puffy clouds in the sky. I pulled car off to the side of the road and step out walked to the passenger side and looked up I had noticed a glare to my right in the sky like a reflection off of metal. It was a circle shaped disk tucked slightly inside the cloud. About 3/4 of the way out. It was close enough that I could make out the details. It was a silver color Circle shaped with a circle Dome on top smaller then the bottom part. It looked like something out of those old Sci-Fi flicks. While I was staring up at it a shield opened on the upper dome for about 2 mins then closed. The cloud slowly coverd it or it moved back into it and disappeared. I got into my car and told my family friends and filed a report. I could pass a polygraph test on this event. I never had another experience again with the UFO.

It was a silver round disk with a dome centered ontop alot like the ones in the 1950s space movies;1993-08-01 17:00:00;5 minutes;It was a silver round disk with a dome centered ontop alot like the ones in the 1950s space movies I was driving home from work with my young son around 5:00pm. It was a clear day except for a few fluffy white clouds. On a heavy traveled road I pulled off because I had noticed a silver disk sticking only a little way out of the clouds above me.. I got out of the car and stared at the round silver disk.. there were no lights on the disk. The thing that surprised me was how much it looked like the saucers from those old 1950 space movies. There was a dome that was centered atop the disk that had a shield the closed after I was watching for several minutes The most scariest was the fact it was very close to me I could see it prefectly clear..Then it pulled into the cloudes and I drove home ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
