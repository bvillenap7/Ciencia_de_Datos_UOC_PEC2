4 bright orange lights over Warrenton VA;2014-06-28 23:30:00;10 minutes;4 bright orange lights over Warrenton VA My wife and I were housesitting / babysitting over a weekend for her parents (my inlaws).  We went outside to share a cigarette close to midnight.  We were talking when I saw a strange orange light over her shoulder. The closest airport to us is Dulles International Airport to the North, but this thing was going East to West from the more rural area of the county, farms and such.  The thing was like a super bright flare but not flickering like one, and it was under power of some sort. There were no blinking lights on it and it was about the same color as a fire.  No flickering, no smoke, no sound and it was moving casually from East to West as I said.  After about 10 seconds another identical light appeared traveling in the same direction at the same speed. I lost sight of it after it passed over the houses in the neighborhood so my wife and I ran out front taking her grandfather and younger brother with us.  He says he was an engineer or something for the air force and he has no idea what it is.  After those 2 lights eventually left sight in the distance we were laughing about it and joked it off. I decided to go back to the back and finish the cigarette we started.  While out there I saw 2 more identical lights traveling the same path as before, got everyone outside and we watched them for a while going off to the distance. None of us is sure what it is but several of the neighbors saw it too and told us so when my wife posted about it on Facebook.;38.7021461538462;-77.7929153846154
This was a long object.  Not a single satellite.  It appeared to be one unit, ((NUFORC Note:  Cluster of Starlink satellites.  PD));2019-11-11 17:40:00;45 seconds;This was a long object.  Not a single satellite.  It appeared to be one unit, Unexplained Sighting November 11, 2019 Warrenton, Va., Approximating 50 miles of Washington, D.C.  At approximately 5:40pm, I observed a long thin line of lights moving from out of the Northwest towards the Southeast at an altitude similar to that of a satellite.  I was able to watch this for about 45 seconds.  The line of lights moved uniformly as one unit and appeared to under control.  I estimate the length of the line to be a mile or longer.  There was no sound that I could hear from this event.  I estimate the number of lights to be around 35.  The line was made up of dimmer white lights toward the front and 4 brighter white lights toward the back of the line. The dimmer lights had a small oval appearance. The larger 4 lights looked similar to that of a satellite.  While watching, I did not see any change in the number or color of lights. The object maintained its course until it was no longer visible.;38.7021461538462;-77.7929153846154
