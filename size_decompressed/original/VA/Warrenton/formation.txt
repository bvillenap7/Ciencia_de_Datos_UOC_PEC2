Strange lights above Warrenton,Virginia.;2011-10-08 22:00:00;2-3 minutes;Strange lights above Warrenton,Virginia I was out at a farm,in Warrenton, Virginia, that was hosting a Haunted House, I was watching my grand babies while the others went in the House, me and my sister were talking when suddenly behind her in the sky I spotted what appeared to be several lights.  I at first thought they were planes...then I thought it was part of the Haunted House to scare people...the lights were a bright orange in color,with 2 in the lead in front of the rest. They travel from south east to north west in direction from my right to left they all traveled at the same speed and looked to be about plane high...maybe 20,000 ft?    The formation was larger in the sky than the moon with each individual light looking star sized as they traveled they began to disappear,two by two until only two were left...they traveled a little farther then disappeared also.;38.7021461538462;-77.7929153846154
