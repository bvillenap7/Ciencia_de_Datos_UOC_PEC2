Weird lights in sky over Virginia farm.;2011-10-08 22:00:00;1 minute;Weird lights in sky over Virginia farm I was talking to my sister sitting in a chair when she looked past me to the sky, she stood up and ask me  what is that?   I turned to look and saw a large formation of orange lights moving across the sky from my left to right they were in a distinct pattern shape and they were traveling at the same pace, I would estimate them to be at a elevation of approx.  10,000 feet high  and the formation was larger than the moon in the sky they began to disappear 2 by 2 till they were all gone.;38.7021461538462;-77.7929153846154
