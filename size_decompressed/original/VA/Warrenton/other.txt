Brightly illuminated large object above Warrenton, Va.;2020-11-02 21:00:00;2 minutes;Brightly illuminated large object above Warrenton, Va. I was walking the dog on a clear night, and noticed the Western sky was very bright.  I looked up, and saw the approach of a large object that had bright white lights completely around its perimeter.  It was so bright, that I couldn't tell if it was pentagonal or hexagonal in shape, but I believe it was one of those shapes. It was definitely not rectangular, triangular, round, or oblong. It made no noise as it moved slowly across the sky to the northeast.  I observed this from a residential neighborhood about 2 miles from The Warrenton Training Center.;38.7021461538462;-77.7929153846154
