Two white circular lights near Big A Mountain;2019-10-09 21:45:00;1 minute;Two white circular lights near Big A Mountain While travelling SW on Finney Road (Rt 620) near tail end of Big A Mountain about 1.2 miles from Route 80 two white lights appeared just beyond top of Mountain through tree tops moving south to north, lights (seemed to be ~100ft in diameter each) were circular and appeared to be several hundred feet apart.  As we were driving we went out of sight of the lights and they were gone off to north when we topped mountain and were able to scan the sky for them.;37.0367;-82.0242
