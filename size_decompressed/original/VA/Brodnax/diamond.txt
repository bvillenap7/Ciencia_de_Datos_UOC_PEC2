Tonight, at approximately 20:55 pm, I observed in the northern sky a multicolored., blue, red and yellow to be exact!  Diamond shaped object with the lights revolving in the center of it just sitting there above the trees north of my place!   I could not hear any noise in the sky, and I went and grabbed my binoculars to look closer!  When I looked at it, I saw what appeared to be a smaller white object move across and around it from the left to right side.  Then at that time it started moving towards the left slowly getting faster as I kept looking and following it in the binoculars!   I got a good look at it and seemed to no I was watching it because the longer I kept watching the faster it moved out of my view!  In my best estimate of size based on viewing with and without binoculars, it was the size of a one of those big red farm barns is all I can think in size to compare!;36.7299;-77.9876
