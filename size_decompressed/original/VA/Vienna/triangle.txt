Four glowing, moving, orange dots in the sky with three in a triangle;2013-08-10 23:00:00;1 minute;four glowing, moving, orange dots in the sky with three in a triangle Tonight I was driving my car with a friend in the passenger’s seat to a friend’s house.  My friend was the first to look out the window and point out.  Three were in the formation of a triangle and one other dot was to the bottom left of it.  As we drove closer, two disappeared into the night.  We continued to drive and a few seconds later another was gone as well.  The final dot remained (the one not initially from the triangle) and emitted a small light that shot away from the dot.  Although we were initially semi-believers of aliens, we can officially say that this has affirmed our belief!
