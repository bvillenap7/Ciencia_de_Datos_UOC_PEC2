Large? rectangle over my house 12 miles from White House.;2007-02-16 19:00:00;30 sec;Large? rectangle over my house 12 miles from White House. I stepped out of my rear door ( faces due south 180o) at 19:00 hours and looked up at about 40o saw 2 lines of light flashing, appeared to be on object. It is hard to judge size because the lights are receding to the south and I had not seen it directly overhead. The base leg to Reagan Nat. Airport is directly in front of my house, if I were to use a 757 at 3000 feet to guess the size I would guess it to be wider than and longer than the 757. There were 6 lights directly in line on each side flashing they were white most of the time though I think no. 2 from the front alternated red. As it was dark it was hard to guess size and speed. There was no noise. I saw this 12 miles from the White House. 2 helicopters showed up from the north several minutes later they continued south for several miles and then circled back where they joined almost over my house. They slowed to almost a hover and then continued on to the north. Channel 5 News has a fairly large copter, I called and asked if it had been over Vienna at 7pm and they said no, and they had not had any calls about a strange craft. This Craft flew 90o across the base leg of Regan airport at 7pm with planes landing at less than 1 min. intervals. ((name deleted));38.9032888;-77.2612288
