This was a red cigar shaped craft spinning in all directions but attached to a red circle in the manner of a gyrosphere. There were white beads of light coming and going from the mothership as if they were reporting back after venturing.  It was way up in the sky and the owners of the house have seen it in the exact same place most nights for three years.;38.0704;-78.9066999999998
