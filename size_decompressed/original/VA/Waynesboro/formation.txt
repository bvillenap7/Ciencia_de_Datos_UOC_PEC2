40 bright white dots traveling quickly, Augusta county Virginia.;2014-11-18 19:00:00;10 minutes;40 bright white dots traveling quickly, Augusta county Virginia. While walking our dog tonight at approx 7:00 p.m. my wife and I noticed approx 40 bright white objects moving west to east in a large spread out group.  This is the second time that we have witnesses this in the last 7 or so months.   The last time we saw these objects the weather was exactly the same, clear & cold with gusts from the west.  The only difference this time is that there were twice as many objects, all traveling the same direction, but at random positions up and down back and forth.   It is very hard to say how high they were, but maybe at a few hundred feet is all.  This only lasted for 10 min before all were out of sight to the eastern sky.;38.0704;-78.9066999999998
