My wife and I went camping in the Blue Ridge Mountains from 7/21 to 7/24,2001. About 225 am on the 23rd, I was stargazing with the telescopes I brought along. In a clear sky,(no scopes, just my naked eyes), saw a triangular shadow, blocking the stars- it seemed to move at about the same velocity as a mid-sized passenger jet, low altitude, no noise. From my point, it seemed to bank right sharply for a short distance, and I lost sight of it. I would have difficulty trying to guess it's size and speed. And it did get me to surf the net for ufo information. I am not a crackpot, I have over 15 years past experience in the commercial airline refueling and managing a freight forwarding outfit for a dc-8 airline. And, I am into amateur astronomy as a hobby. I read a couple of reports from Virginia here, and I do know it was not a far-off missile. Whatever it was,( and it was not a stealth fighter-I am familiar with them also) it was solid, dark, and quiet. And it did operate much lower than the commercial planes I did view at much higher altitudes, and could hear their thrust even. I have no photos, and my wife was asleep.;38.0704;-78.9066999999998
Large...beautiful...and brighter than anything I've ever seen....How small I have felt since....;2006-10-10 16:00:00;8-10 minutes;Large...beautiful...and brighter than anything I've ever seen....How small I have felt since.... I have tried to e-mail several people on this site, as I felt this report form could not due my sighting it's justice.  I'm curious, is there someone in my area that would like to talk to me...that would be great...but for now...here it is in brief (if such is possible). Leaving the AMC Hospital...looked up and OH MY GOD!!!  There it was....or there it was traveling....at an extremely high rate of speed...this Big...shining...Big...craft...(of some nature). I began to zig and zag on the road leaving the hospital...not able to take my eyes from what I was seeing...as I approached the stop sign, I noticed a car had pulled over on the right side of the road...it's occupants seeing...what I was seeing!!!  I pulled out onto the main road and immediately pulled off the road....head in...head out...glasses up (sunglasses)...glasses down....what in the @$#@# is that??? I pulled out (as it had moved...quickly) and drove up the side road...and noticed behind me..three other cars...all doing the same!!!  Now...here goes the description...at first when I saw this...I could see no outline of anything...just this extremely large white...glowing...and here is where it gets quite difficult...the color...odd as this is sounding...I've nothing to compare it to...it was soooooo bright.....not white....not blue....just....nothing I've ever seen.....ever....it was traveling at a very fast rate of speed and very, very large...at first I thought...a meteor...cool...than thought...OH My God...if it is..we are in some kind of big trouble down here, then as I moved to the off road site, as it moved...with my sunglasses on...and only then....as it was too bright to look directly upon...I could see a triangle...enlongated, of course, due to my position to it...down went the glasses...up went the glasses....and every time...the same...Wow...as fast as it was traveling....all of a sudden....it stopped... It stopped!!!  I cannot begin to tell you what was going through my head!!!  I looked back at the person ! in the c ar behind me (by the way...it was man in a red car...and that is all I can remember about him....) he was standing half way out of his car...looking...gazing...just as I was... then...off it went...and I mean...off it went... I could see it go.... I know this writing is haphazard and I would love to speak to someone who checks into this sort of event, in my area.... I'll never be the same...that is all I can...it was the single most exciting thing I've ever wittnessed....and feel almost blessed to be one of those to see it.  I've nothing to compare it to...it's color..speed..any of it...I'm so eager to hear if anyone (and I know there were others) have reported this... ya know what...it was even stranger that...as it was over...all three of we cars pulled out...not one of us spoke...heheheee  If they were as overwhelmed as I was I do understand....I look forward to hearing from you guys or someone in my area....thanks  Oh...this was in Fishersville, Va...3:15 in the afternoon...and clear as could be...beautiful...blue autumn sky....not a cloud in the sky...and I've not been able to look down to the ground since... :) I've actually felt very small and vulnerable since seeing this...and felt...I should do something... but what...tell you guys;38.0704;-78.9066999999998
