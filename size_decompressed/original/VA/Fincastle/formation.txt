Illuminated objects and face captured on wildlife camera on Feb. 10 2008 in Virginia;2008-02-10 20:41:00;unknown;Illuminated objects and face captured on wildlife camera on Feb. 10 2008 in Virginia My parents have a Wildlife camera set up on their property in Fincastle, VA. When ever there is motion close to the camera it will shoot a picture. They have many deer, turkey pictures etc. But on 2/10/08 there was a series of strange photos. It started at 8:14 am there is 3 pictures of something in sky with a huge light effect around it. It even covers the trees as you can see in the pictures.  Then at 8:41 pm it gets stranger still. Te first picture almost looks like a coat sleeve the 2nd maybe an outline of a leg and arm, but the 3rd picture is breathtaking. There is a face that is illuminated you can make out many facial features. It is unlike anything I have ever seen. If this was not my parents etc. I would think it a hoax. But since it is my parents and I know better we are simply speechless as to what this could be.  PLEASE help us figure it out. ((NUFORC Note:  Black spots are due to photographing the rising sun with a digital camera.  Face looks like human face, placed very close to the camera, so that it is severely over-exposed by the intensity of the flash attachment.  PD));37.4883;-79.8547
