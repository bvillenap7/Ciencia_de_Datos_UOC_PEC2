There was a bad thunderstorm, and we drove into town to take pictures of the clouds.  Did not see anything but the clouds.   Drove  back home and downloaded all photos from cellphone on laptop.  Laptop broke and did not fix until winter of 2016.  Went through to delete old photos and found the image.   As you can see, it is greenish, rectangle shape with some white lines that could indicate fast movement and there is a shadow going to the ground.   I put the copyright on the photo, but please do not publicize my name.  I would just like to know what it was.;37.4883;-79.8547
