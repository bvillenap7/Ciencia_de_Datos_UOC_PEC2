Walked out onto back porch, surrounding trees were full of small, swiftly moving objects. All emitted white blinking light(s), but shapes varied: rectangular, orb w/ point on end (as a teardrop laid on it's side) & half-circle w/flat portion on bottom.  There were so many, but they were WAY too big to be fireflies.  We watched using a pair of Nikon binoculars & a night vision scope.  But they were easily seen with our naked eyes also. I know it sounds insane, but we would both submit to a lie detector if asked. We've seen strange, erratically moving lights in the distant skies about 1x/month for about the last 7-8 months.  Movements extremely fast and directional changes very abrupt--very different from airplanes, jets, etc.  These have blue, green, white or a combination of same lights.  Most often the lights will change as one watches in telescope, binoculars &/or night vision scope.;36.8091;-78.4538
