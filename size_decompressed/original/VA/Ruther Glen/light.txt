On 4-12-11 at about 830 PM (est), I witnessed a light in the sky moving from side to side changing from red to bright white.  This activity continued for about 10-20 minutes before disappearing behind the trees out of my view.  When I first saw this, I was sitting in my truck talking on the telephone.  I then hung up with the person I was talking to and called my wife outside.  We both watched this for about five minutes before we lost sight.  Now I live close to a military branch ( Fort A.P. Hill).  So this could very well be some kind of new technology our government is working with.  I have never seen anything like this and is wondering if there is some kind of explanation?  The Camera on my cell phone could not pick it up.;37.9451;-77.4714
