Large ufo in Ruther Glen, VA.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-27 21:10:00;18 seconds;Large ufo in Ruther Glen VA I just saw 4 large star like lights in a perfect diagonal Line ascending In the sky.  They appeared to be on one large object as the didn’t move independently and were in a perfect sequence the exact same distance apart from each other in in a perfectly straight line.  These lights appeared as long as the distance the Big Dipper takes up in the sky.. very big whatever it was    There was absolutely no noise..they didn’t blink ... it moved at a steady pace until the lights slowly faded as it went higher up in the sky, two at a time ... still have goosebumps... this is my first UFO sighting...  I am a believer now.;37.9451;-77.4714
