It was a small shiny metalic circle in the sky way to high for most airplanes.  i watched for approx. 45 seconds, when i tried to adjust my view of it and better block out the sun it was gone. while i watched it, it didnt move any that i could notice.  the only other thing that i could think that it might be would be a sattelite, but i have never seen one of thoes in the day and they seem to noticabley move when i have seen them at night.
