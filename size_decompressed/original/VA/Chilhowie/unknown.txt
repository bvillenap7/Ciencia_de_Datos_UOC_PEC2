Object NOT Sirius;2001-02-02 19:10:00;Couple mins;Object NOT Sirius This is in regards to the posting from Bristol, Tn. on 2-2-01.  I'm about 30 miles northeast of Bristol. I'm familiar with Sirius and its proximity to Orion.  Rest assured that the sighted object was NOT Sirius.  We think, do you know how stupid that makes people feel? Anyway, there's my two cents!;36.7736;-81.6655
