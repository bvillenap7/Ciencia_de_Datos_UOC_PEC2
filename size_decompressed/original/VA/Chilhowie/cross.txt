One of the witnesses reported that the objects had 4 lights each on the bottom of the craft, in a + formation. Object itself was not seen, but from the light formation, we are assuming the craft is triangular or airplane shaped. After 2-3 minutes of just sitting there, each object took off at tremendous speeds into a different direction(ex. object 1 came from the North, shot into the East, object 2 came from the South, shot into the West). The witness I spoke to mentioned that he couldn't remember any sound, but wasn't for sure. I am an independent Ufologist, and this report came to me from a co-worker who saw these objects with their brother. From the description he gave me, I first considered the possibility that these were convential aircraft, maybe refueling or performing some kind of training. However, the objects he described seem to fit the description of an airplane maybe, but after he told me that they became stationary, I'd never heard of any airplane performing such a feet in mid air, at least not 100 + ft. above the ground. I'm not convinced that these craft were extraterrestrial, but they don't have the characteristics of being anything I've ever seen or read about that could be military or experimental.;36.7736;-81.6655
