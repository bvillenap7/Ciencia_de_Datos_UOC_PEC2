THREE OBJECTS IN NIGHT SKY, Chilhowie/Marion, Virginia;2006-07-04 21:00:00;30 minutes;THREE OBJECTS IN NIGHT SKY, Chilhowie/Marion, Virginia In the Cleghorn Valley section of the Chilhowie/ Marion, Virginia area of Southwest Virginia, which is mountain terrain of an average of 2,500 feet above sea level. I saw three distant objects in the sky which moved very slowly, sometimes getting into a triangular pattern and then very slowly fade back to a straight line of 3. I showed my wife's father and family and he concluded that it was airplanes.  However there was NO NOISE AT ALL from any of the three. They stayed around for at least 30 minutes, slowly making their way out of site behind clouds and mountains, only to appear again about an hour later. I ALMOST called 911 to report this and have wondered ever since if anyone else did. I kept telling the others that it was UFO's. Could it have been weather balloons? If so why would they go from a triangle pattern back to straight line? They did not change color and appeared to be white/blue lights, but they definitely moved, although slowly, and definitely were not stars.
