Bright blue oval shaped object in speedy descent;2019-02-26 21:00:00;5 seconds;Bright blue oval shaped object in speedy descent At approximately 21:00 hours on February 26, 2019, my husband and I were on the way home from dinner in the nearby town of Farmville.  We were driving southbound on route 696 (Green Bay Road) when we spotted a large oval shaped, bright blue object in the sky.  In a matter of seconds, the object descended into the tree line at a very high rate of speed near Leigh Mountain Road where several cell phone / radio towers are located.  My husband and I remarked, “Did you see that?” and “What was that?” at the same moment.   Because of the object’s speedy descent, my husband (a law enforcement officer with thirteen years of experience) remarked it looked like an aerial vehicle crashing.  Upon reaching our home about ten minutes later, my husband checked his radio for traffic about a crashed vehicle.  There was no radio traffic concerning any downed aircraft.  My husband lived by Oceana and the Naval Base in Norfolk, VA, for 30 years and never saw any military craft resembling what we saw tonight.  Because of the short duration of our sighting, estimates on distance and size are difficult to say.;37.121;-78.3058
