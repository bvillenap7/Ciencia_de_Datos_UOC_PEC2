I was standing in my front yard with my dogs, taking photos of the ice left on the trees from the storm.  Suddenly the entire sky lit up for one second like daylight but totally green, as if through a green filter. The very next second, all the power in the neighborhood went off and then came back on instantly.  My instinct was to expect a noise or boom, thinking it may have been an explosion, but there was no sound.  My dogs seemed disturbed for about an hour after the flash, but everything else seemed normal.  My son was upstairs in his bedroom and said he noticed a green light flash into his room on his curtain.  He thinks he may have seen an object cross the sky, but was unsure.  I think we may be the only two people in town who saw it, though others noticed the brief power outage.;38.5083;-77.9943
