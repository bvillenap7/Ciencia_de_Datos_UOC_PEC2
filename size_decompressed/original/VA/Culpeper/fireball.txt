White object seen by driver in northern Virginia in the northern sky.;2019-10-11 19:30:00;2 minutes;White object seen by driver in northern Virginia in the northern sky. I was driving north approaching US 29 North, when I saw what looked like a large white meteor/fireball headed left (East) moving downwards.  It then moved upwards to the right and then downwards again to the left, appearing as if it were going to crash.  It moved upwards again and then I saw three fire stripes coming from either side.  It then moved down for the final time and disappeared.;38.5083;-77.9943
