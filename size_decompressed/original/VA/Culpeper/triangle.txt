At about 9 pm, we saw multiple lights in the northeastern sky.  They were moving erratically and slowly and we could hear no sound. One approached and flew a few hundred feet over our house.  As it approached, I thought I saw a spotlight hit the ground not too far away, but it did not remain. As it flew over, from what I could see, there were three lights in a triangular pattern, a red one towards the front and two blinking white ones toward the back.  I actually could not make out the actual shape of the aircraft.  As it flew over, I could hear a very slight humming noise but that was it. Looking up casually, one might have thought they were regular airplanes, but what was strange was that they all seemed to have the same flashing lights pattern, and they were moving too irregularly, too slowly for an airplane, and with no sound.  Also, another strange thing that happened a few times, one of the lights would get very bright, almost brighter than a star for a few seconds, and then the light would disappear and be replaced by the red and white flashing they all seemed to be doing. We watched for two hours and they never left.  They would fly from one end of the sky to the other and then back again (distances of what seemed to be hundreds of miles). It was almost like they were looking for something or surveying the area.  We never heard a noise, not like you would think you would hear from so many aircraft in the sky. It was really strange, I've never seen anything like it.  This was the first UFO sighting of my life and it was one of the most exhilarating moments of my life.  I kept waiting for them to fly over my house again so I could get a picture but they didn't.;38.5083;-77.9943
