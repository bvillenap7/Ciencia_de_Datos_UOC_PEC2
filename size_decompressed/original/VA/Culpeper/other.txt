Small town Culpeper sighting!!;2013-03-03 01:00:00;15 seconds;Small town Culpeper sighting!! Went outside for a cigarette.  Soon as I stepped out I looked up and saw a V formation of a swarm of 8 to 12 craft flying together they were white.and the inner 4 started to switch sides in sinch.   After we saw them go beyond our sight because of the house next door.  We look back again and there are two more on a different path but in perfect formation.  These two don't go beyond out sight but disappeared with a flash of light accompanying then. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be flawed.  The sighting may have occurred on APRIL 03rd, 2013.
