Took my dogs outside for their last bathroom break.  Two red slow strobing lights either in formation or one large craft with two lights.  Stars disappeared behind as it went past.  Very slow moving, and I could hear the airplane which was in the sky coming from the south west.  The object(s) was/were moving in a steady progression west.  All the crickets and tree frogs seemed to stop chirping as this object moved in the sky over our home.;36.6485;-82.4324
