Bright green light in the shape of a soft ball.;2007-05-26 00:45:00;5 sec.;Bright green light in the shape of a soft ball. On the night of May 25th to the 26th 2007,I was sitting on the couch and decided to go on the front porch to have a cigarette. It was a warm night and the sky was clear. I was looking up in the sky at the half moon when I noticed a bright green light in the shape of a soft ball sail across the sky from south to north, at first I thought it may be an asteroid, but at a second glance, it streaked across the sky in perfect intervals of two second dashes and absolutely no sound,leaving no sign of a trail, until it went so far north that I couldnâ€™t see it any more.
