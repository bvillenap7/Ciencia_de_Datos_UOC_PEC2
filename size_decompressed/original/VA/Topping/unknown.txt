Erratic flight path.;2014-03-03 20:00:00;15 minutes;Erratic flight path. The shape of the craft is unknown but I would have to say it appeared to be triangular at times.  I witnessed this after dark so all I could see were blinking white lights.   The object was above the horizon when I first noticed it and was stationary.  After a minute or so it began to move upward but wobbled side to side as it rose. The object then began to move south toward my house.  The trajectory from the time I noticed it to the time I could no longer see it was slightly erratic but that is not what made me suspicious.   As it moved through the sky, the object disappeared and reappeared multiple times along its flight path. During all of this, there was a soft sound like distant rumbles of thunder.;37.6037;-76.4598
