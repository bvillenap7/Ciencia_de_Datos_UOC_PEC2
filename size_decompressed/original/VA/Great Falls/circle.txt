The camera is mounted 20 ft. high in a tree to give me optimal range & scope.   These two light came into view and disappeared over the next hour and nine minutes of recording.  They would be stationary for a few seconds and then turn at 90 degree angles.  Weather conditions were excellent that evening with little cloud cover.;39.0045;-77.3062
