I’d say the size of a blimp and looked like A blimp but it was a dull tin color with nothing written on it . I was going to reach for my phone when I did t want to miss what I was looking at .. as I made the U-turn it was gone ..  I pulled maybe 75 feet into the parking lot from where I saw it and there was nothing there anymore ... Military experiment ??That part of the airport there isn’t really anything there going on ...  Definitely was gone as if nothing ever happened within seconds;39.0019403508771;-77.4544933333335
