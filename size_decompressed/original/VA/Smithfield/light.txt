5 red and blue flashing lights with 2 pairs moving in tandem over Smithfield, VA;2015-10-10 22:30:00;1 hour +;5 red and blue flashing lights with 2 pairs moving in tandem over Smithfield, VA Around 2215-2230 on October 10, 2015, my boyfriend went outside out.  We are in the country, so being able to visualize the stars is normal.  While he was looking up he noticed two lights that were flashing red/blue (this was a continuous flashing that never changed) and moving in tandem of each other.  The movements were very precise.  They went up, down, zig-zag, and sideways but always seemed to be in tandem.  He brought me outside and I immediately saw the same thing.  Then I looked a different direction and saw another one.  They were not planes, as there was no sound.  There also isn’t any plane that could move like they did.  Then through some of the tree’s we noticed another one.  When the objects were not moving but just hovering they had a little bounce or wiggle.  If one object was moving a great deal it seemed the others stayed rather still.  This went on for about an hour.  Then they just slowly started getting farther away and disappeared. The same thing occurred again the following night on October 11, 2015.  The first 2 flashing red/blue lights we saw were in the exact same place, then we saw the third and it was in the exact same spot as the night before.  There was less cloud cover this night and we saw two additional lights.  These also seemed to move in tandem with each other. Total, we saw 5 lights but expect that the single one probably had a tandem partner that we could not see. We watched again for close to an hour. When we went inside they were still there. When we woke the morning of October 12, 2015 at 0500 there were no lights that we could see. We tried to obtain video but could not get anything.  What we saw is similar to video we found online dating back to 2012/2013 of mysterious lights in the sky. My boyfriend has his Masters in Biological Oceanography.  He worked for 8 years with Science Applications International Corp. as an Environmental Scientist (the company worked with the Navy).  He is currently a high school Biology teacher.  I just finished school for my Registered Nursing.  Both of us are highly educated and very observant people. We don’t believe in aliens per se. However, something is going on in our skies.;36.9779;-76.6329000000001
