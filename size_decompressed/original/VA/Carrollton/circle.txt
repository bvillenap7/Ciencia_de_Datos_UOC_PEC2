Sighting of Circular Craft in Isle of Wight.;2002-06-14 21:00:00;20 minutes;Sighting of Circular Craft in Isle of Wight The following took place on a Friday night, June 14th, 2002.   I was sitting on my back porch, just prior to 21:00, when I noticed a peculiar looking aircraft in the distance across Route 17, over top of a neighborhood by the name of Canon Acres.  The craft could have easily passed for a helicopter, but there was something unusual about its appearance.   Because of this, I maintained concentration on the object, and it seemed to take notice, and slowly descended in my direction.  To give a frame of reference, Canon Acres was less than two miles as the crow flies.  Again, the object seemed to gravitate toward me, until it hit my property line about 30 yards from my location.  I could clearly make out its shape, which was spherical, and approximately 22 feet in diameter.  It had five lights in total one extremely bright white spotlight at the six o'clock position, and four lights, comparable to an airplane's strobe lights, blinking in a! random sequence.  Starting from top to bottom, the lights went red, green, white, and amber.   The craft maintained an altitude of around 15 feet from the ground, and made a noise similar to the electronic hum of a refrigerator.  After about 15-20 minutes of observation, the craft shot out a white flair that sizzled in the same manner of a flare gun used for nautical purposes.  The flare rose high above the pine trees around my property, only to land on the main road in front of my house.  The flair touched down, and then elevated to about three feet off the ground, made a sound that I can only equate to the beginning of Pink Floyd's Welcome to the Machine, and then took off at an astonishing speed.   When I glanced back to its source, the craft had completely vanished.;36.9573;-76.5470999999999
