A black or very dark triangle or diamond shaped object(blurred by sheer speed & low altitude). In my yard in Blue Ridge Mts. 1st I heard the sound of something very unaerodynamic whistling through the air from behind me. One cat ducks, another dives under the S.U.V.. I look up just in time to see what's described above. Sighting lasted only 1/2 second as it flew just above treetops followed by complete silence. No rumble of a B-2 Stealth engine nor any sound of crashing into woods. Direction, E to W.;38.0161;-79.0345
