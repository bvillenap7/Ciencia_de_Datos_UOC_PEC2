Bright White Light in Partlow Sky !!!!!;2009-12-17 22:24:00;15 minutes;Bright White Light in Partlow Sky !!!!! I was riding my bike down the road and was looking in the sky at the stars.  Next thing I know I saw a shiny bright white circle of light.  I thought it was a helocopter spot light but it wasn't.  I stopped and looked at it for 10 mins.  It stayed in one spot, moving flat across the sky really slowly.  I continued to ride my bike down the road and it was just hovering in one spot.  I lost it above the tree line.  I kept riding and I saw it again when the trees got smaller.  I got to my road and next thing you know it dissapeared.;38.0625;-77.6584
