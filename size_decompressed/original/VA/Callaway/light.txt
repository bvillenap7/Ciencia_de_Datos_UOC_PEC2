Round bright lights moving rapidly seen over mountain in Callaway Virginia January 2007;2006-01-23 17:50:00;15 seconds;Round bright lights moving rapidly seen over mountain in Callaway Virginia January 2007 On January 23, 2007 at approximately 5:50 pm I was leaving my friendâ€™s farm in Callaway, Virginia when I saw three distinct bright lights suddenly appear and then drop behind a mountain.  One light was much larger than the other two and there were several smaller lights that seemed to flicker on and off.   My first thought was that there had been a plane crash.  But, I have not heard of any plane crash or any planes missing or lost.  And this would have to have been a large aircraft.  There is a flight path that goes over her property, but there was no noise what so ever.  This is farm country with no street or city noises and planes are definitely heard before they are seen.  It was still daylight and the lights I saw were bright white or even silver and completely round and crystal clear.  I mentioned this to my friend last night (1/24) and she stated that she also saw what I saw.  She said that she saw a red light, which I did not see.  She did agree that there was no noise and her first thought was a plane crash.  This morning (1/25/07) on her way to work around 6:00 am she again saw lights appear and then disappear quickly.  She is an ER nurse and I am an office manager for doctors.  We both feel that what we saw was real, but we would like to find someone else who also saw this.  There have not been any reports in the media.;37.0311;-80.0491
