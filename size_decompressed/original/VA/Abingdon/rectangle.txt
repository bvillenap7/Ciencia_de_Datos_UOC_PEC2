2 LARGE rectangle, 1 tubed craft seen over Abingdon, VA;2008-06-23 22:08:00;1 hour;2 LARGE rectangle, 1 tubed craft seen over Abingdon, VA Multiple LARGE UFO's were seen by me and four to six others in Abingdon, VA.  I am an ex military paratrooper and Pathfinder.  I have seen and jumped out of just about every military aircraft in service, and have never seen anything like this.  Large Black rectangle with lights (smaller) on each of four corners underneath, one larger, dimmer  set back from front two and centered, with large red beacon rotating in center.  First was at about 2,000 ft (i know as ive jumped from that level), second in half hour later as we watched descend, level out, move and then begin to rise at about 8 miles out over Bristol, TN.  Both moved at 45 to sixty knots in West to East direction along interstate 81 and Lee Hwy.  Went right over my head at insainly close distance on Beverly Dr.in Abingdon, VA.
