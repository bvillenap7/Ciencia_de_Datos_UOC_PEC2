Next day, I have a slight sunburn and my eyes are really red. Sighted extremely bright star in the distance after pulling into a parking lot.  I kept watching this object as it seemed to hover in the distance.  At first I thought it was a helicopter whose lights were coming towards me so I watched it for a bit.  It then started coming towards me after about 6 minutes or so and I noticed suddenely two lights appeared, (or were turned on) red and blue, and they started blinking.  I got out of my car and looked straight over at the object as it came toward me and proceeded to come directly overhead and it moved extremely slow.  I noticed there wasn't any sound that I can remember coming from the object.  As it went directly over my head for the life of me I can't remember the shape of the object.  This is unusual for me since I am a professional web designer who takes pride in remembering details.  As I was standing there looking up at the object, two elderly ladies came out of the building but didn't notice the object at all.  The distance from me to the object was approximately 400 feet.  After I looked at the ladies I looked back at the object as it kept moving slowly.  I looked back to the ladies then looked back at the object again and it was gone.  Immediately after going inside the building I noticed my skin was burning a bit and didn't think much about it until today the day after.  My face appears red, just like a minor sunburn.  It is also still burning a bit and my eyes are also red.  This object was spotted off highway 81 in Bristol VA near the exit 7 area.  Earlier that day near road 700 I saw a black helicopter off in the distance, I had also saw one close to my work place even earlier that same day.  I would think nothing of this except for the fact that I saw the strange object and now have a slight sunburn to prove it.  Unfortunately I did see this object by myself and the elderly ladies didn't even look up from something they were both reading.;36.6861934210526;-81.9908618421052
Plane follows unexplained light;2008-04-08 21:05:00;1 min;Plane follows unexplained light Husband called for me to come outside and see a plane follow something in the night sky, headed in direction of ENE. Very clear that another 'something' was ahead of it. Was one big light. Did not blink. Too far apart to be related to the plane (not refueling plane). Dissappeared after about a minute and plane continued into the night sky. Sorta spooky.;36.6861934210526;-81.9908618421052
