I first thought it was a satellite or low star and then reasoned it was too low and seemed to move.  I went inside and asked by skeptical husband to come and look.  He thought it was strange as well.  We ruled out helicopter and at that point I went and got my video camera with a rather large zoom.  It got stranger from there.  My husband thought it might be a drone as it would get farther from the camera and then come back closer.  However, when it did come back closer, I got very interesting video that did not look like a drone as it had many more lights not to mention it was bigger than personal drones and I have not ever seen a military one so I can't say it wasn't.  My son came out and wanted to look and he said it looked like it was morphing.  Very strange.  We got in the car to see if we could get closer to the object and got some additional video.  We live in a mountainous region of SW Virginia so your view is often blocked by trees and low areas.  We tried to think of another high spot and went out Route 19 towards to North Fork River.  We got half way there and realized we were to low and our view was being obstructed by the hills.  When then came back into town and went up on a hill at our local Moose Club but once again trees obstructed our view until we came down the hill.  We got additional footage and after reviewing it looks like the there are many lights and they are twinkling.  We headed home and that is the last we saw of it.  The event lasted around 40 minutes.  I plan on checking with our local airport to see if they had any calls or if they can identify the object in my videos.;36.6861934210526;-81.9908618421052
