a large, perfectly round light, much larger and brighter than any star;2003-09-15 21:00:00;30 minutes;a large, perfectly round light, much larger and brighter than any star I went outside at 9 pm to make a call on my cell phone. I looked up and saw a huge golden , yellow light in the sky. At first I thought it to be a star, but then realized that it was too large for a star and that it was perfectly round. There was a haze surrounding it, like heat?? I went inside and got my digital camera, came back outside and took the first picture, The second I took the picture the light vanished. I took another picture in the same location then stood watching. A couple, maybe two , minutes later the light reappeared, it kind of grew in brightness till it was as bright as before. I took more pictures then I became very scared, terrified actually. I watched this for almost 30 minutes then i heard strange noises from inside the house. I was at my brothers home and he has 2 small iguanas in a tank. The iguanas were goingcrazy, running around the cage and one climbed a cord inside the cage, laced one claw through the mesh on top and put his other claw on his stomach, his head was cocked as if waiting or watching for something...maybe even listening. I was even more scared at this point and very aware of everything around me, like all of my senses were very heightened. I just wanted to be inside with all of the curtains closed. I felt like an animal that is being hunted. When I arrived back home I downloaded the pictures and I was amazed. There was not just one object but nine. The other eight I could not see with my eyes but they are on the pictures. And the picture that I took after the light dissapeared shows that the object is still there in outline. You can see very intricate patterns on all of the objects and all of then are identical.The one that was lit is larger than the others and it never moved but the smaller ones seem to change position from picture to picture. I have already spoken with a MUFON investigator and have agreed to send the pictures that I have taken. ((NUFORC Note:  We have not received copies of the photos, yet.
