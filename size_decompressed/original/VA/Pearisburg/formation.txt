((HOAX??))  Stars spinning in a circle.;2017-06-03 01:00:00;10 minutes;Stars spinning in a circle. I've never seen anything like it, one object like a moving star came directly down and stopped.   Then the star released more, until there was like 10 spinning around in a circle, faster and faster.  Then I woke up.  Not like a dream well it was like a dream, but I woke up from reality.  I guess, there was no evidence nor sightings after that.   If you don't believe me, i understand. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect this is a hoaxed report, but we cannot be certain.  PD));37.3017;-80.7256
