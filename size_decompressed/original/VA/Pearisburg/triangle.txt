Triangular object with green lights.;2016-11-21 07:30:00;5 minutes;Triangular object with green lights I was waiting for my husband to come home and looked out the window. While looking down the road, I happened to look up to see how the sky looked.  It was a beautiful clear night and I was thinking how awesome it looked with the billions of stars out. Then I saw a moving light that at first I thought may be an airplane.  Then I noticed it had green lights and I never remember seeing a airplane with those colors.  I wasn't thinking too much until it stopped in mid flight and then glided a bit to the right, hovered, then moved to the left.   That is when I ran out to the front of our house onto the porch.  This flying thing was the shape of a triangle with green lights outlining the outer parts. It traveled over near our home and it was quite a ways up.  It once again did that gliding to the right. I mean literally went to the right without turning at all.  Then it was a whoooosh and gone in a millisecond.  I didn't hear anything, but then again, it was up pretty high! .  Note to self.  Get video camera that is good for night time taping..;37.3017;-80.7256
