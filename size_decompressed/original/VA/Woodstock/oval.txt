An oval-shaped craft with green lights was observed on the evening of April 21st near Woodstock, VA.;2007-04-21 20:30:00;3 seconds;An oval-shaped craft with green lights was observed on the evening of April 21st near Woodstock, VA. The craft was observed just after dark on an April (21st) Saturday night.  There were clear skies, and I was driving south on I-81 near Woodstock, Virginia when the anomaly in question passed overhead, also headed southwest. It was roughly parallel to the ground and just to the left of the interstate, with multiple green lights contained in an oval shape with trailing sparks. It was visible for maybe 2-3 seconds before it simply disappeared/vanished.  It was a virtual duplicate of a sighting I had several years ago further down I-81 near the Rockbridge-Botetourt County line: same time, direction and description, albeit 80-100 miles further north – an experience I called in to the Rockbridge County Sheriff’s Department at the time. The difference? I had a witness riding next to me, my wife was dozing in the front passenger seat when I told her to look up.  The thing was visible long enough for her to awaken, look up, and see it to.  Other traffic on the highway at the time had to have viewed it as well, but I found nothing in news reports the following day.  I couldn’t judge altitude, size or speed, but if the spark tail was from atmospherical re-entry it was quite large and flying at a speed well above the posted (65 MPH) limit.
