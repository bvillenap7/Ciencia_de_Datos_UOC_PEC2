I noticed the beam if light hitting the ground as it was approaching.  It was moving rather slow, I took close to see if it had wings or a tail like a plane would,also listined at noise the  engine was making, no lights on the bottum of the object.  The object did not turn an any direction, it moved one speed and not enough noise from the engine to disturb homes and nieghborhoods.  I work for the DOD and I know what we both saw.;36.8524421331311;-76.5188273827546

Black triangle craft seen in Suffolk/Chesapeake Virginia over I-664.;2015-10-21 05:00:00;10 minutes;Black triangle craft seen in Suffolk/Chesapeake Virginia over I-664. I was driving to work on highway 58.  Two bright lights.  As I drove and turned on I 664 I saw the object heading west as if it was coming from Virginia beach area.  It was dark but I clearly saw.  Triangle outline with one light under each pointed end and a round center light in the middle.  There was also a white strobe near the center light.  As the craft passed overhead there was no sound.  The craft passed and I saw the rear as two extremely bright rear lights flashing 4 to 5 times per minute and what looked to be a solid red strip of illuminated light I between the two white flashing light.   Oh yeah....Iam a naval officer with 26 years in, so I am familiar with aircraft, and we don't have anything like this.
