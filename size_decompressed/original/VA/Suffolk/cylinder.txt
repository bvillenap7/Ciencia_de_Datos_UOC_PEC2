It looked like the space station with smaller crafts coming from it, going to the ground and going back up to the larger craft, they went back and forth many times.  After 30 minutes I got tired of watching them and went back inside and went to bed.  I saw the crafts in the south-west skies.  I could hear dogs barking from a distance. Skies were clear.
