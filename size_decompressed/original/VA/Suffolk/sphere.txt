Large, orangey colored sphere rose slowly from behind trees in the distance and traveled silently across the sky.;1984-07-25 20:00:00;5-10 minutes;Large, orangey colored sphere rose slowly from behind trees in the distance and traveled silently across the sky. This happened when i was a kid-(im almost 35 now.)  I know i was around 13 or 14, and my little brother and his friend,who was spending the nite, (both around 10 at that time)-were outside after dark, probably around 8ish or so one nite during the summer.  We lived in rural Suffolk, and on a long dirt road.  Our house was surrounded by some open fields, and after those were lots of woods.  So, we were out there goofing off, and one of us notices this bright, orangey colored ball of light rising off in the distance.  I cant say for certain, but im certain this light was at least several miles away from us.  But this 'ball' still looked huge.  It just rose slowly, straight upwards--not sideways, not at an angle, but straight up in the sky.  This color was orangy, but could be described as an orangy-yellowish color too.  It was very bright, and VERY noticeable.  It was like watching the sun rise, except you could look at it, or like how a basketball might look big in the sky if you could float it at a distance in the air of around 2 or 3 storys high--That's how large it looked, even though it was obviously at a distance of several miles away from us. I do not recall if it pulsated or anything like that--im pretty certain that it did not, but i know that the color never changed, nor did the shape change at all.  The boys ran inside to get my folks.  My mom came out figuring it was probably an airplane or something.  However, she was just as puzzled, excited, and scared of this as we were.  She had no clue what it could be. We realized that the object was not rising any longer.  It was moving horizontally now, and towards us somewhat.  It was moving at a VERY slow, non-hurried speed.  When we realized it was moving towards us, my mom sent my brother in to get our dad.  The object was travelling more sideways than towards us.  It got closer, but not much.  We just stood there, watching it as it slooooowly made it way across the nite sky in front of us.  We could hear nothing at all!  After a minute or so of trying to convince our dad no one was pullin his leg, he came out like mom did at first--expecting to see an airplane or helicopter.  Instead, he caught a quick site of it as it finally disappeared over the tops of trees in the distance and we could no longer see it.  He TOO was mystifyied as to what it was.  I have never to this day seen anything that even remotely resembles it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));36.8524421331311;-76.5188273827546

This happened at 5:27 pm on black Friday, right before sundown.  I was on the phone.  ((NUFORC Note:  Satellite re-entry.  PD));2017-11-24 17:27:00;<3 seconds;This happened at 5:27 pm on black Friday, right before the sun was gone, i was on the phone when it happened. Five bright colored orbs shot out from behind the top of the trees at a diagonal angle all in unison, they slowed down dramatically after they shot out from behind the treeline, and very quickly the two orbs on the leftmost side came together into one orb at the same time that the two orbs to the right of them did and the orb all the way to the right moved closer to the center and just faded out, they didn't go in any direction they just dissapeared where they were. So to simplify that last part the 5 orbs turned into 3 orbs and disappeared.  It freaked me out cause I thought it was a commercial plane because of how big and close the lights seemed, but then within the span of probably 3 seconds or less, five bright orbs turned to 3 and blinked into nothingness like they were never there.

Then I turned and begin looking around in the night sky and turned my direction to the western sky and noticed round, white blinking object that caught my eye. The more I watched this one object, it was acting so erratic moving (in all directions). My heart began to pump fast and I felt I was seeing an actual UFO. I went inside my home and retrieved my phone and begin taking (2) videos of the sighting. I am 62 years old and have gazed many times over the years in the night sky and have seen shooting stars and in a solar  eclipse in 1972, but nothing like what I saw today. I would hope that someone else may have witness the same sighting today and report. I am forwarding my videos to (www.directorufocenter.com) for review.;36.8524421331311;-76.5188273827546
