cork-screw contrail, low-boom sound flash.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor??  PD));2005-03-14 11:30:00;5 sec.;cork-screw contrail, low-boom sound flash Dear sir,  I saw a flash of light with a cork-screw contrail that lasted about 2 seconds after the flash passed over my house.  Then I heard a low boom that lasted about 2 sec. thereafter.  The boom sound echoed twice afterwards in another area from where I live.   This would appear to me to be something like a plasma-gas experiment which uses a new kind of engine up-dated technology.  The reason I am stating this is because of the speed of the flash as well as the boom sounds that ocurred during and after my sighting.
