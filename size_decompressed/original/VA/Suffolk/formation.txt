2 Rows of 4-5 vertical white solid lights moving slowly together in the evening sky, just over the tree lines.  ((Starlink satellites??;2021-01-28 17:10:00;30-45 seconds;2 Rows of 4-5 vertical white solid lights moving slowly together in the evening sky, just over the tree lines. It was January 28th 2021  about 5:10 PM it was Twilight and I was heading down Godwin Boulevard in Suffolk Virginia and I noticed in the North Western sky there were about 4 to 5 vertical white solid lights and about 20 feet between this one there was another 4 to 5 vertical lights and they moved extremely slowly just above the tree line,  keeping an even distance between the other and itself. As I was driving I looked around trying to see if someone else was seeing what I was seeing but I'm not sure if anyone did. So I was watching these two vertical light rods is the best way to describe what I was seeing moving slowly together in the sky, just over the tree lines. I drove through two to three lights watching this happen before pulling off into the Bojangles parking lot and coming around the building to see if I can capture some video. It literally disappeared within that two second time frame. I cannot find any natural explanation for it. It was strange but what made this stranger was A month later (almost to the day) I saw something in the same area but quite different from my first sighting. I made sure to document what I saw. After doing some research I ended up finding this site and I wanted to share what I witnessed hoping maybe someone else has seen anything similar.;36.8524421331311;-76.5188273827546
