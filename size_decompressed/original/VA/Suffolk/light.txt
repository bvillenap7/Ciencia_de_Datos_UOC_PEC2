Dozen red lights in formation over Northern Suffolk, VA;2013-06-15 21:25:00;3;Dozen red lights in formation over Northern Suffolk, VA About a dozen red lights came from the western horizon in various formations, some two or three at a time. No sound came from them.   As they approached the middle of the horizon they began to fade, as if disappearing into clouds, though no clouds were present and a passenger jet coming across from the opposite direction was not obstructed by anything in the sky.;36.8524421331311;-76.5188273827546
Objects over Suffolk, VA, January 4, 2016.;2016-01-04 17:45:00;30 minutes;Objects over Suffolk, VA, January 4, 2016. I was driving home down 58 and saw one white light flying across the sky and stop next to another one.  They both stood still as I turn to look at another two objects adjacent to them.  I could not take a pic while driving in the interstate therefore when I stopped to the stoplight as I got off the exit towards Obici hospital I tired to take a photo of the object but the light changed before I could do so.   When I arrived home I was backing into the garage I saw three bright lights in a triangle formation the size of a football field In the sky the light were so far apart I could not take the pic and it was very hard to see them clearly.  I put my phone I.  The seat and looked up in the sky and omg there were 3 objects flying around under the formation of the white light formation with pulsing lights one was blue, one green and the other was red.  Over to the side of this activity there were two white lights in the position of two headlights in a car.   I panicked and backed into my garage, called my best friend because I had to tell someone what I was seeing.  I got my baby out of the car and was very fearful to go no out side.  While I was talking I took my trash canister and put out for trash pickup in the morning.  As I looked back up in the sky while tiling to my friend The triangle formation had moved slightly north the different colored objects has disappeared and the two white light positioned like car lights were zig zagging like figure 8's) in the sky.   There was no sound!   This was a very disturbing scene.   I watch the history channel and seen many documentaries about ufos and I never thought that I would ever witnessed what I have tonight!

Military escort UFO.;2019-01-09 06:33:00;15 seconds;military escort UFO It was what appeared to be a US military Jet flying along side a supremely bright light, color was unlike anything I have seen.  After flying through a cloud the military aircraft kept flying and the second craft (light) was simply gone, as if it vanished.  The jet was at full thrust as its engine was glowing and based upon a the size of the jet they were at a decent altitude moving at speeds I can not describe.  Crossing nearly the full sky in a matter of seconds.  I was driving so no photos or videos were taken.;36.8524421331311;-76.5188273827546
