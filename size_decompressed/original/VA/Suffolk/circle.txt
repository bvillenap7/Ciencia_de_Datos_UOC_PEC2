Drove up to downed ship.;1978-08-15 21:00:00;2 hours;Drove up to downed ship. I was driving down an unlined country road with a friend.  I started to experience static on my radio and slowed as I attempted to adjust it.  My car cut off in the middle of the street and I was unable to get it started again.  I noticed outside the drivers window a circle of light on the ground on the ground in a field next to the road.  I said to my passenger, I don't remember there being a water tower here? and when I looked again I noticed that this watertower had no legs.  The next thing I noticed was that there was no sounds.  This was especially odd as we were next to a small lake and dam where the water could be heard almost all the time.  There was no cricket or frog noices.  It was the loudest quite I had ever heard.  My friend became hysterically screaming and pounding on the dashboard of my car saying Let's get out of here!  Then I was compelled to get out of the car.  I remember thinking to myself that this was incredible and I wanted to remember it.  There was an old fence around the field that had some vine type growth on it and although I don't recall crossing it, I remember standing very near to the circle of light on the ground and noticing that the hairs on my arms were standing up and I was not cold.  I also noticed that there was no filteration of light from its source to the ground.  I could look across the circle of light into the woods at the edge of the field and it would appear as if no light was around.  There was no spreading of the light.  I wanted to remember this.  I looked up into the light source and saw what appeared to be a circler light the size of the stars in the sky.  However, it was only about 50 feet off the ground and the other stars seem to only be visible in a circle around the object, which was black as the sky, approximatley 50 feet from the center.  The light source had a 50 feet diameter length of blackness the same color as the sky around it and then you could see the other stars in the sky, so the craft was vertually invisible.  I looked over at my! friend, who was perfectly still in a pose that looked as if she stopped in mid stride of hitting the dashboard of the car.   I looked back and noticed grooves on the underside of the craft along with what appeared to be a flag and symbols and then the crafts light went out or it shot straight up until it looked exactly like its surrounding stars, no blackness around it any longer that was unusal compared to its neighboring stars anyway.  Then the star did a criss cross toward the north until I could no longer see it.  I was very excited about it and wanted to discuss it when we got home.  However, my passenger was unable to stay awake and two hours had passed that only seemed like a few minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have asked the witness to contact the other party and request that that person submit a report, as well.  PD));36.8524421331311;-76.5188273827546

Way too large and this was orange almost like a fireball.;36.8524421331311;-76.5188273827546
Two hovering ufos in my neighborhood skyline.;2018-04-28 21:50:00;Still ongoing;Two hovering ufos in my neighborhood skyline. The shapes are just bovering in the sky!  They are far to bright to be planes or helocopters  and even so,  both would be moveing (a helicopter-- acumpanyed by ysound at least-- for that is common of our helocoptors,  we always hear them).  However, I did see a plane flying in the sky not too far from it, but I don't think it noticed, but just seeing them side by side I knew they were not anywhere near the same aircraft.  They have flickering lights.  One is hovering in the sky in my front yard,  the other in the back yards skyline doing the same.;36.8524421331311;-76.5188273827546
