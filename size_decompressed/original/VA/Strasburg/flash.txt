Weathe;2012-11-03 19:45:00;10 minutes;My fiancee and myself witnessed several flashes which lit up the northern sky.  Some flashes varied in color mostly red or blue.  Weather radar shown no storms surrounding the area and there were no visible air crafts that could be a source of these light flashings..S ome clouds in the sky, but not many.  Each light emitted a rolling sound, but not like thunder, more like the sound of a bomb detonation.  There are no known military test sites in this area.   These flashes were also seen at the same time in the same location, the night before (on 11/02/2012.)  However, on the previous night, there was no noticeable noise that accompanied the flashes.  We managed to capture the flashing via cell phone video camera.;38.9868;-78.3341
