Silent, low-flying object glided over the house tonight. Never seen anything like this before! Object flew in straight line. Noiseless, yellowish-orange and whitish lights, big, circular, very low flying, and very slow. Called County Dispatch (non-emergency 911) to see if any reports of object in sky or verified low flying planes. None confirmed. (We're figuring a deputy will show up to make sure that we aren't drug addicts :-) Kids are freaked out by what they saw, my old man has never seen anything like it before and says he is sure it wasn't a plane, I caught very short glimpse. We live in the woods and lost it in the distant trees. Drove to find it, but was unsuccessful. Made the kids and the old man draw what they saw (without being near the others while they were drawing) and all have similar pictures. Not sure what else it could have been.!?;38.9868;-78.3341
