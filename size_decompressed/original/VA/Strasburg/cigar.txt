2 cigar shaped white objects viewed in Shenandoah Valley, VA;2010-10-01 18:30:00;5 mins;2 cigar shaped white objects viewed in Shenandoah Valley, VA 2 bright white cigar shaped objects side by side.  Position in sky: imagine a line drawn from 11 to 5 o'clock.  They were a few miles apart.  At first we thought they were clouds but they were identical in shape, size & position. Viewed from vehicle on I-81 (leaving Stephen's City driving into Strasburg). Once on Rte. 11, parked at McDonald's to view safely.  One began a slow slight descent about 1/4 further down than the other.  Then it stopped.  We witnessed them stagnate for 5 mins but due to scheduling could not watch any longer. As we continued traveling down Rte. 11, they remained to the right in the sky, near the mountains.  It seemed like the sky was ripped in 2 places and the brightest whitest light was shining through the rip.;38.9868;-78.3341
