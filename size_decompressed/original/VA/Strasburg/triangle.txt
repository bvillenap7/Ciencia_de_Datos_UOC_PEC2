V Shaped Object Over Strasburg, VA;2016-12-21 21:00:00;10 minutes;V Shaped Object Over Strasburg, VA Arrived at my house around 9 pm just east of Strasburg, VA, when I noticed a series of lights coming over Signal Knob mountain.  The lights formed a triangle or V shape.  At first there were only 3 but then 2 additional lights turned toward the front of the object.  We watched the lights for several minutes, they were white, in a straight line, and moved silently and slowly.  The object was large, probably 1000 feet in length and was entering the Dulles flight path.  It soon turned and headed south and eventually faded out of sight.  A few minutes later, we saw 5 aircraft coming from Washington, DC, area at a high rate of speed directly toward where the object was heading.;38.9868;-78.3341
