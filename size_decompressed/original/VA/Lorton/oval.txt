Ball pointed zig zag light scribble through night sky in Virginia for 2 seconds.;2014-05-06 02:00:00;2 seconds;Ball pointed zig zag light scribble through night sky in Virginia for 2 seconds I was outside looking at the sky star gazing late AT NIGHT and I saw what appeared to be a shooting star at first, zig zig downward in a very bright streak.  Almost like a scribble in the sky.  It clearly had a ball point on the front in which was a hint brighter than its trail it was leaving behind..  In the trail it looked like there were lighter ball points in the sharp turn areas of the trail.  It only lasted for like a second, but after I searched on the internet today to see if anyone else had seen something like this, I found that a few Hawaii places reported seeing a zig zig light in the sky appear for a few minutesâ€¦ I watched the video and that is exactly what the thing in the sky I seen looked like that day except I seen this in Virginia a late night and it only lasted for a second or 2..   The date of 5/6/14 is a rough estimate of the day it occurred because I cant remember the exact date.  But I will say that It at lease 5 days before my birthday ( may 14) because I had to get a rental to go see family at the top of the week and when I ran into my friend a couple days after I arrived at my relatives, I mentioned it to him and he said  o yeah, that just n exploding star in which I didn't pay any mind to it nor did I check the internet to see if anyone else had seen it the day after I saw it..   What a wonderful experience, I wonder what it was. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));38.696;-77.1995
