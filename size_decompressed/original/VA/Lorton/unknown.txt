When I heard what sounded like an incoming jet, I peaked out my blinds to see if I could see where the sound was coming from.  I then walked away from my blinds in fear of an incoming crash.  As I watched I saw what looked like a firetruck or ambulance drive straight past my window at a very fast speed.  The only problem is that there is no road that goes past my apartment.  I glanced out and saw multiple red lights over the hill.  They switched direction then went back up the hill only to disappear.  Then the sound was gone;38.696;-77.1995
