Silver Aluminum UFO observed by a sceptical Baptist Pastor above the Mountains of Virginia;2002-06-08 14:00:00;30 seconds;Silver Aluminum UFO observed by a sceptical Baptist Pastor above the Mountains of Virginia I observed a silver aluminum object above the mountains while traveling with my family from Pennsylvania to Arkansas. The object appeared to be 100 feet above the mountains flying up and across. When I first noticed it it appeared to be in the shape of a box and not very big (about the size that a small private plane might look at that height). As soon as I saw it it tried to show it to my family. As I was pointing where to look (taking my eyes off of it for a moment) it changed shape (from its movement I believe) to a round bottem cup shape without the handle (the round section being at the top). I lost sight of it after looking away the second time to try and point it out to my family. The sighting only lasted about 30 seconds. The craft(?) was not in a hurry really but seemed to be just crusing around. I don't know how it disappeared (fast or vanished) for I lost sight of it after looking away for just a second. I am a Baptist Pastor and do not believe in little alien dudes with buggy eyes and green heads...However I do know that what I saw was not anything I have ever saw or heard of in my 42 years on this planet. I am amazed at my close encounter!!!;37.7799;-79.9881
