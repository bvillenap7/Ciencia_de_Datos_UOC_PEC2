The object had three distinct parts. Each has at least two lights. They are arranged in a three parallel line formation with the middle line sticking slightly past the other two. First this object was blue over the tree line. After going onto my back deck and taking the first picture, which failed to show, it changed to yellow as if in recognition of my attempt. I took another picture, which came out well, just before it gained speed and flew relatively over my vicinity. The picture is going to be emailed from the account theonewhofell@hotmail.com Thank you for you time;37.3371;-79.2815
