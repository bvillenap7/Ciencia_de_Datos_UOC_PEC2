We noticed an orange orb hovering over the ocean.  It was quite bright and I grabbed the binoculars.  It appeared to have red and blue lights when I looked through the binoculars.  It was hovering for about 3 minutes and then blinked out.   It was a very clear night, and you could not miss it.;37.7186;-75.6815999999999
