I was going on break at work,and like normal went to my car,and looked up to my left(east) in the sky at the stars as i like to,but als;2014-12-15 21:32:00;~5 minutes;I was going on break at work, and like normal went to my car, and looked up to my left (east) in the sky at the stars as i like to, but also saw 3 redish dots/balls in the sky at different heights, the left being the lowest, the right being the next highest and the middle being the highest, but they were far enough apart to tell they were not a single aircraft,and the thought crossed my mind that they were too dim and close to all be towers,also ahead of me (south) in the distance i could see the red blinking light of a tower as comparison.as i walked to my car keeping my eyes on them i said to a passing co-worker what are those lights i don't know,she replied uninterested.  So i continued to my car(walking slowly the entire time to keep my eyes on the lights) but in the short time it took to look down to step off the curb the one on the left disappeared. then as i walked and refused to look away again i bumped into another co-worker and pointed them out to her, but she continued inside seemingly uninterested also. So as i look on the one on the right and the center one were climbing straight up ,from my view,and the one on the right disappeared and finally the one in the center climbed the highest and disappeared.they didn't flicker or anything,they were very well defined constant lights.i looked on the way in and after work but didnt see them again sadly.;37.7186;-75.6815999999999
