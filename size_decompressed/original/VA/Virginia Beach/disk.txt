Group of  friends an I  follow a UFO on bicycles, I have a sighting alone about a week later.;1973-10-01 15:00:00;10-30 minutes;Group of  friends an I  follow a UFO on bicycles, I have a sighting alone about a week later. I was about 8 years old and a group of kids in my neighborhood were riding bikes on Longfellow Ave. I looked up at the sky and noticed a UFO approx 500 feet above us, silently, we all decided to follow it and we rode our bikes all the way to the end of the street and then turned around when it sped up to the point where we could not keep up. Approximately a week later, at approximately 5pm, I arrived back  home from a Brownie Troop meeting (my mom picked me up and drove me to the house afterwards) and my mom brought my brother in the house to start dinner. For some reason, I decided to not go in the house right away, I was on the side of the house and looked up and could not believe my eyes, I saw the same UFO I saw a week earlier, I looked up and felt paralyzed and did not move for what seemed to be approx 10-30 minutes (it was hard to tell how long it was there).  The disk had square windows that beamed white light, it was silent and quite mesmerizing. When! it left it, darted up at the sky and seemed to silently disappear at an unbelivable speed.  My mom asked me why it took so long for me to come back in the house because she was almost finished making dinner.  I didn't say anything about the UFO to her because I thought she might not believe it, anyway. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I say almost disk shaped because the edges did not come to a point but were straight, could have been cigar shaped at an angle.;1994-04-19 22:00:00;3-4 minutes;I say almost disk shaped because the edges did not come to a point but were straight, could have been cigar shaped at an angle. U.F.O. Sighting. Time frame 1993-1994 (cannot recall the exact date) Location Virginia  Beach, Virginia approximate Latitude, Longitude: 36 49.1' N, 76 08.9' W Shape : disc, maybe cigar depending on the angle. I was a teenager at the time and was with a group of friends, when someone quickly exclaimed that there was a U.F.O. hovering over the neighboring golf course. Where upon we all turned our attention to the skies to examine the object.  All of the other teens quickly agreed it was a U.F.O.. I was the only skeptic at this point trying to find an explanation. What I witnessed was a black almost disk shaped craft with a series of red lights hovering in the sky.  I tried explaining it by saying it was a blimp moving slowly at a strange angle away from us so it appeared not to be moving. We debated this for about one to two minutes when the craft nearly vanished before our eyes accelerating at a great rate of speed I cannot compare to anything I've ever seen. I immediately conceded and agreed what we witness was a U.F.O.. I have never seen anything like it since, nor have I seen anything like it in any photos I've seen of U.F.O.'s online or on television.

Saw UFO above Rosewood Memorial Park on Witchduck Rd. in Virginia Beach, Virginia Summer of 1993/1994;1994-06-15 19:30:00;2 minutes;Saw UFO above Rosewood Memorial Park on Witchduck Rd. in Virginia Beach, Virginia Summer of 1993/1994 I was about 11 years old outside playing hide and seek with the other neighborhood kids. I was standing in the middle of Jericho Rd just off of Aragona Blvd looking down the street facing Rosewood cemetery. I looked up into the sky and saw a typical looking UFO.. It had lights but it’s been so long I don’t remember exactly what colors.I don’t remember seeing any metal because it’s was very bright and lit up. The UFO proceeded to come closer to the ground until I couldn’t see it anymore because it was blocked by those big hedges that separates the cemetery from the church playground.  The UFO while close enough to ground to have landed I do not know if it did for sure because it was blocked by hedges.  It was only out of my sight for couple seconds and then it shot up super fast into the sky until it disappeared.  It was extremely fast like hypersonic speed.  The date of the sighting is uncertain but sometime in summer of 1993 or 1994.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
Glowing UFO spotted around a military airstation;2002-11-04 18:45:00;5 min;Glowing UFO spotted around a military airstation My wife exclaimed, Look!  What's that in the sky? I looked up and saw a strangely lit disk shape with a white or blue light blinking on top and bottom.  The UFO was lit in a very peculiar manner.  It seemed every inch was perfectly lit, as if the object itself was glowing.  The color was a pale greenish.  there seemed to be a ring around the disk that was a darker color, perhaps black, though it still was completely visible against the night sky.  The moon was not out, as it was hidden behind the clouds.  The only light source I can imagine was from the UFO itself.  It hovered stationary, it seemed, though we were in a car.  When we pulled into our driveway, the tree line in our neighborhood blocked our view, so we lost sight.  If the UFO was moving, it was doing so very slowly and in a kind of sliding manner.  I am going to go and look for it again.  Hopefully i will have more to add, along with photos, in a short while.  Oh, one more thing.  As soon as we got out of the car, we heard jets roaring.  We live near an air station, so that is not abnormal.  However, the jets were flying in 2 pairs, away from the direction we saw the craft.  The speed and throttling of the jets seemed to be slightly abnormal for the weather and night situation.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125

Small black sphere dancing in Virgina Beach sky;2007-04-02 14:15:00;about a 1 min;Small black sphere dancing in Virgina Beach sky I was sitting in my backyard reading a book being that if was a very beautiful day.  I noticed a swarm of buzzards or some type of bird of prey so I watched the circle overhead.  I then noticed a small black sphere moving across the sky at about the same speed an aircraft would fly.  At first I thought it was some sort of military craft, which is not unusual around Virginia Beach.  But then the craft stopped abruptly, backtracked dropped slightly in altitude and then continued in the direction it was originally heading.  It continued behind a cloud and then reappeared even slightly lower than it was before.  It then paused, hovered for a moment and then shot off amazingly quick up and to the left, back into the cloud.   I stared at the sky for a few more min, hoping to see  it again, but I didn’t.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
Craft crosses in front of commercial airplane.;2014-03-31 19:11:00;~30 seconds;Craft crosses in front of commercial airplane. I was letting my dog out the back slider door, which faces directly West.  She went out and I stood there with the door open looking up at the sky, there were a couple commercial airplanes and the only reason I was really watching them was because they were leaving trails behind them, one closer to me than the others. I was focused on the airplane that was closer, it was headed East toward the ocean, (which I live about 10 miles from) when out of  nowhere a grayish flat disk shape craft came from the south and was headed right for the airplane. I thought at first I was going to witness a mid air collision, but the craft crossed right in front of the commercial airplane and after about 2 or 3 seconds of me trying to see what it was, it simply disappeared. There was no trail left by the craft, the commercial airplane kept heading East making a trial behind it. I looked at the clock and saw that it was 7:12pm, so the event took place about 7:11pm. I am hoping the pilots of this commercial airline makes a report to confirm mine. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Huge 1000-ft long saucer accelerated skyward and disappeared during the day, Virginia Beach.;2014-06-15 14:30:00;1/2 second;huge 1000ft long saucer accelerated skyward and disappeared during the day, Virginia Beach I was in a clearing on the KOA campsite in Virginia Beach.  I turned around and looked up and an object pewter in color, with a compressed dome on top with 3 portal in it .. took off silently at an a speed I can only describe as astonishing.  I am a retired military aircraft mechanic and have 20 years working around aircraft, including hi performance aircraft.  This object had no seams, it made no noise.  It appeared not quite over damn neck base.  And for some reason I thought nothing of it. It had to be the length of an aircraft.. It had a feel of a hologram but there was just something that gave it depth of field.  I have knowledge of photography and it was so fast you couldn't have gotten it on camera.  It went at an angle of about 70-80 degrees vertical and then veered left toward the atmosphere like the space shuttle  I can be contacted at (757) ((number deleted));36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125

Orange glowing domed shaped disks with red lights around the bottom of each.;2015-01-01 00:00:00;20 minutes;Orange glowing domed shaped disks with red lights around the bottom of each. Saw a whole fleet of domed shaped saucers all aglow in orange, with red lights around the bottom.   They were flying due east towards the ocean.  They kept coming.  I stopped counting at 20.   They were first headed right over our house, and then also to the far right.  There was so many, me, my daughter and son couldn't count them all.   I tried to take pictures with my Vivitar camera.  They didn't come out as clearly as we could see them with our eyes.  We were in awe!;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125

Two objects, one with the structure and one just a light moving over our neighborhood then apparently chased away by jets.;2019-04-18 21:25:00;1-2 minutes;Two objects, one with the structure and one just a light moving over our neighborhood then apparently chased away by jets. Fixed typo errors:   I’m pretty sure I photographed 2 UFOs last night, 4/18/19 around 9:25 pm, in Virginia Beach, Courthouse Estates, Lancaster Village, from my yard.  I am including photos.   Not the light beams, but 2 objects moving together at a perfect angle.  It’s possible that the brown blue light was coming off of the structure of the craft.  I don’t know  One had a structure and the other was a round blue light.  They were totally silent and moving slowly then I lost sight of them.  Then almost immediately several loud,  low-flying jets flew over us, going in the same direction as these objects.  You are welcome to contact me if you’d like. Geez, I keep trying to submit this and making errors.  That was supposed to say I have included photographs.  And it should also say round blue light, not brown blue light. ((NUFORC Note:  One of the objects, a small greenish circle, we believe is a lens flare.  We are unable to identify the other object.  PD));36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
