Saw a small,boxlike object with spikes or antenna travelling slowly over the city.;2012-08-19 12:45:00;25 seconds;Saw a small,boxlike object with spikes or antenna travelling slowly over the city. On Sunday afternoon I was leaving the Walmart on Phoenix Ave near the Lynnhaven Mall in Virginia Beach, VA. This is about 1/3 of a mile west of the Oceana Naval Air Station.  It was a rainy, drizzly day but had stopped at the time.I turned northbound on Lynnhaven Parkway when I saw an unknown object in the sky.  It was indistinct in shape, as it had what appeared to be antenna or spikes extending laterally fore and aft and to some degree on the bottom. It was about the size of a nickel held at arms length.  My impression was that it was about the size of a desk several hundred feet off the ground. It was dark in color and made no noise any louder than the traffic. I drove slowly and watched it travel west by southwest in a straight line at about 10-15 mph. There were no markings or lights. It started to get behind my position and traffic compelled me to drive on. It was perfectly steady and did not appear to be a balloon of any kind. I thought it may have ! been an airborne surveillance device, but it certainly wasn't anything like the stuff you see on TV. There was no obvious means of propulsion.  Just a brief, weird thing.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125

Light in the Eastern sky rotating and changing colors.  When we uploaded the pictures, it became clear of what we witnessed!;2015-02-03 23:38:00;20 minutes;Light in the Eastern sky rotating and changing colors.  When we uploaded the pictures, it became clear of what we witnessed! My husband was outside with our dog and he came in to get me and said he seen an unusual light in the Eastern sky.  I grabbed the camera and went out to confirm what he and I were now witnessing~  We both witnessed an object that was rotating and changing colors.  It would move close and then further away.  There was no sound and we could not see the shape, only a light. By this time I was taking pictures, as well as a short video.  We watched the object for about 20 minutes and then went in because it was very cold and my camera was cold.  The object was still there when we went inside. I uploaded the pictures to the computer and we could not believe what we saw!  The main craft was hard to see, more of a hazy mass, but within this mass, we could see very clearly 4 spheres/balls within the object.  There may have been more.  Only by enlarging the pictures could we see any kind of shape.  We of course, have the memory card as proof. My husband and I have been watching the skies for many years and we make it a point to go out on clear nights to look at celestial events as well as for UFOs.  For the last few years I have been president of the UFO Club Of Virginia. We are sending the best of the pictures to you.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125

PD));2017-11-24 17:25:00;3 minutes;moon-white object with swept wings appeared to spurt debris several times then break into three pieces. We were at Mount Trashmore in Virginia Beach, Virginia, walking counter-clockwise around the lake, at the southern edge facing east.   To the southeast, well below the moon, without any prior trace, a white object the color of the moon and as bright, appeared in the sky, looking large, as though quite close, moving level, left to right, appearing to have swept wings, like a military jet, and a fuselage, appeared to eject three distinct bursts of debris, including what looked like small round balls, then broke into three pieces, and disappeared without a trace.  No afterglow, no fireball, no sound whatsoever.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
2 people and dog present, saw multiple planetary bodies moving and behaving extremely erratically.;2020-07-15 04:19:00;02:00;2 people and dog present, saw multiple planetary bodies moving and behaving extremely erratically. I have a video that I would like to share.  Two people and a dog were present.  The camera video did not cap ture everything we saw, but it does convey the sense of erratic motion and shapes in the sky. At first, I noticed eccentricities in the movements of what I thought was the moon and a planet and/or meteor.  I turned my camera on and recorded.  I had to move the camera to keep the (moon/planet/third object) in the frame.  20 seconds into the video, I could not believe what I was seeing and started to doubt it (it was bizarre motion - zig-zaggish), and so I re-positioned and put the camera flat on the ground and had my friend help me keep it steady.  At that point, it was very clear that what we were seeing and trying to record was real. I have photos and video recordings that I would like analyzed.  I am 31 and have never seen anything so erratic in the sky in my life.  The park was: Witchduck Landing Park in Virginia Beach, VA.  The time was 4:19 AM.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
