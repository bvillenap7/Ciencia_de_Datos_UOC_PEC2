Bright white light spotted hovering in the sky, then disappears.;2013-08-19 23:00:00;3 seconds;Bright white light spotted hovering in the sky, then disappears. While standing outside my garage in the driveway smoking, enjoying the silence, I witnessed something odd approximately 500-1000 feet above my house.  (Approx. 11 pm)The sky was brighter than normal due to the full moon. I was facing my open garage thinking about a project I was working on.  I momentarily turned around facing the street when out of my peripheral vision something above caught my attention.  I looked up for a second and saw a rather large bright white light, hovering.  Thinking it was a helicopter at first,  I was about to look away when it occurred to me that there was no noise. At that very instant the light went souring across the sky as if it were a shooting star.  There was no gradual acceleration, it was instantaneous. I was a little freaked out. It was almost like it was watching me and when it noticed that I saw it, took off.  I've heard of people seeing weird things like this, but this is the first time it's ever happened to me.  It appeared to be egg shaped as it traveled, but could’ve just been due to the speed at which it took off that made it appear to be oblong.  I don’t know. But there was second, small red light attached to the large white light when it was moving. Anyway, that’s what I saw. It all lasted maybe 3-4 seconds at the most. No noise. Complete silence. Couldn't make out any shape of the object to which the light was attached. Just the light.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
12/22/13 08:45 Virginia Beach VA  white egg shape object hovered  for 1 hour and dissappeared after cloud cover came in.;2013-12-22 08:45:00;1 hour;12/22/13 08:45 Virginia Beach VA  white egg shape object hovered  for 1 hour and dissappeared after cloud cover came in. At approximately 0845 on December 22, 2013 I noticed a white/transparent egg shaped object in the eastern sky between 20 to 30 degrees in altitude from the horizon.  The sun was rising to the south.  The sun was very bright at that time of the day and it was hard to see the object unless you blocked the sun out from your vision.  There was intermittent cloud cover starting at 0845, but became increasingly heavier up until 0945 when the cloud cover became almost full.  At approximately 0945 when the cloud cover became almost total the object disappeared.  The object never moved and it disappeared during one of the cloud cover periods.  It was hard to see because of the distance of the object and also because of the position of it in comparison to the sun's position.
