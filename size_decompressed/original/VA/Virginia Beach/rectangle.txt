Huge air base on one side but on the empty field across the base there was a VERY VERY large rectangle/square shape hovering. Making NO noise. Huge huge ship. At least a half mile long. Couldnt make out width. Too dark. Recessed lighting on the bottom and NO lights anywhere else on it. Stopped the car in the middle of the road. We rolled the windows down and shut off the engine. You could see it moving ever so slightly (hovering) and the silence I will NEVER forget. Hoping others saw this too!! Not EXACT on the date. But am on location.  -W.W.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
On July 5 at 11:45 p.m., I was with my dogs in the backyard during their potty break because one is scared of fireworks.;2014-07-05 23:45:00;60-90 seconds;On July 5 at 11:45 p.m., I was with my dogs in the backyard during their potty break because one is scared of fireworks.  I enjoy stargazing & frequently look up while outside at night (my back door faces east) and since the moon is only 1/2 full and low on the horizon, it was dark in the yard & I just used a flashlight.  Moving southwest to northeast in a straight line I was surprised to see what appeared to be a bright red rectangular shaped object with a bright white light in the middle.  The shape was something like a sport skydiver might use, except this rectangular object was moving lengthwise.  I know it wasn't a helicopter (saw & heard the police chopper flying earlier before & after the fireworks show), it didn't look like a plane and I never heard any sounds.   I moved to the front yard to get a longer view of it and saw my neighbor (retired military, worked on helicopters) so I called him over to look at it.  He was as surprised and puzzled as I was.  He didn't hear anything and saw the same rectangular shape and colors as it was moving away from us.  The object eventually grew dim and disappeared from out sight, the entire episode lasting 1 to 1-1/2 minutes. I checked the ISS schedule, but knew I wouldn't find it listed as flying by.  I've seen the ISS before & this object was larger/lower in the sky and I could make out a shape vs. the ISS's large all white light image.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
A bright white angular object in the sky during an approaching thunderstorm.;2015-09-10 19:00:00;unknown;A bright white angular object in the sky during an approaching thunderstorm. I took this photograph at a skatepark where my son was skating.  I was photographing a significant approaching storm. It was 30 minutes later, at another location, when I noticed the strange object in the photo. I took the photo with an iPhone 6 which remained in my possession from the time I took the photo until it was viewed.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
Square shaped object hovering over Independence Blvd.;2017-06-11 10:40:00;1 minutes;Square shaped object hovering over Independence Blvd. Square shaped object, equivalent to the size of 3 or 4 hot air balloons hovering over Independence Blvd near Town Center.  The square shape appeared to have 2 legs about half of the length of the square's diameter.  It was grey in color.  I took a video for about 20 seconds with my phone as it hovered moving away from Independence Blvd. heading west.  However, when I replayed my video, for some reason I only captured 3 seconds.  Nevertheless, I did capture the image, but it is blurry.  I took the video from my car while I was in traffic.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125

Usually we see the military jets doing maneuvers with their loud engines.  Today, at approximately 4:00 PM, I saw a large brownish rectangular object flying nonchalantly by.  It was probably the length of three or four of those military jets we watch most days and the height was about a third of that.   It flew pretty much the same areas the jets fly but went straight off into the SE direction.  Very strange and I wondered how that could actually fly being a rectangle.  Since it was there in broad daylight, I assumed it must be military…I saw it for about 2 to 3 minutes as it went slowly by.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
strange extraterrestrial like object turns red flames off when realizing that they’re exposed and then disappears;2020-09-13 20:44:00;60 seconds;strange extraterrestrial like object turns red flames off when realizing that they’re exposed and then disappears I was just in the right place at the right time and as i look up into the night sky i notice something moving across it kind of looking like a shooting star, i got my friends attention to look at what I'm looking at to make sure I'm not tripping, he told me that its not a shooting star, then it looks almost like an airplane but I can still only see the red light or flames I'm not really sure, i started to wonder if it was a plane that caught on fire and then suddenly the object turns those red flaring lights off!! It was almost like that they noticed us watching it and then tried to hide itself, we couldn’t believe we were witnessing this and then it literally just glided into a cloud and it was gone!! But once the lights shut off of this said object we could still notice the shape of it and it was relatively close but only when it was directly above from where we were standing at, I first noticed this moving from the east direction probably a mile away from! our coordinators, i have never witnessed anything like this ever before and it has my full attention I'm very intrigued;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
