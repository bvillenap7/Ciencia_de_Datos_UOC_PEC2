Two creatures or aliens in Bay Colony, no UFO.;1986-09-01 20:00:00;5 min;Two creatures or aliens in Bay Colony, no UFO. This is not a report of a UFO, but of two strange creatures I witnessed.  I was 12 to 13 years old, it was dusk and overcast.  I remember it being windy and about to rain or it was sprinkling.  Out of my downstairs bedroom window, I can clearly see the neighbors house roof.  I was looking out the window and saw a figure on top of the roof ridge about 5 feet from the gable end.  It appeared to be sitting there looking at me!   I watched it for a minute or so and ended up walking away for a minute to find someone else to see.  When I came back to the window, there was a second creature sitting behind the first one and appeared to have its arms around the first one from behind.  Like hugging someone from behind.  They just sat and looked at me for enough time that I figured they wern't going anywhere soon.   So, I left to find a witness, but on my return, they were gone!  I thought it was a racoon or O'possom when I saw the first creature, but soon realised it was nothing I've ever seen.  I was raised in the mountains and have never seen an animal like this!  The best description is a kuala bear.  They were no more than 1.5 - 2 feet tall, more of a brown/black longer fur, and smaller ears.  The roof top was about ~75' from my window.  I've never heard of koala's in Virginia, except at the zoo. This happened in the Bay Colony neighborhood of Va. Beach.  It is a neighborhood surrounded by water and only a few land/road access points through populated areas.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125

Sighting in Virginia Beach near Pungo;2005-10-16 10:30:00;1 minute;Sighting in Virginia Beach near Pungo I was standing at the window at the front of my house talking on the phone to my sister who lives down the street closer to the object that I saw, I saw lights red and white blinking the object was hard to see but a good size it was very low as it was behind the trees in the near distance.   I asked her to go outside to see if she could hear or see anything and she couldn't, I said it's right over near your house and you can't see or hear anything?  No she couldn't, so it couldn't have been a helicopter and it hovered low to the ground for about a minute.   My sister said she noticed the air kind of foggy by her house, at that time but nothing seen or heard).  It was a clear night so I don't know why it would be foggy?   Anyway my husband and son also were looking out the window and they couldn't figure out what it was either, but my husband who always tries to make sense of any situation could not for this one, he knew it was a real object with lights.   Then all of a sudden it moved off sideways and disappeared among the trees.   We went out looking for it but couln't find it, we did see a low bright light in the sky for about a half hour and it seem to get smaller, but that may have been a planet.   Which I will see if I can see it tonight because it was unusally large, bright and very low in the sky to the north.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
2 fast helicopters chasing themselves or something.;2013-10-19 00:20:00;5 seconds;2 fast helicopters chasing themselves or something Don’t know if this is UFO related or not I saw half of the incident. 2 low level helicopters appeared Early Saturday morning, flying west to East over Bonney Road in Virginia Beach, one behind the other and both inclining towards a decent.   It looked like they were chasing each other except they were going very fast.   Never saw 2 ‘copters in a row in chase format.  Could have been chasing after an unidentified craft?   I have not seen this incident reported in any police or military action, so thought it may be an unreported sighting - hence reporting it here.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
Large, bright blue & red lights over Virginia Beach.;2015-08-02 23:21:00;10 minutes;Large, bright blue & red lights over Virginia Beach. It was so unusual I called my husband outside.  He came out and said....WHOA.  I said... exactly what the hell is it!?!   It was very strange and almost just sitting there barely moving,  very bright, pretty,  large lights of red and light blue color.  It just hardly moved and we stood and watched it for quite a while, then it started moving again very slowly in another dicection.   We stood and watched it till it completely just disappeared.  Strangest thing I've ever seen in  a night sky.   My husband is retired Navy and is currently with Homeland Security, and is always the logical one.  He had no explanation for this.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
Walked outside & the object caught my attention.  I live behind Oceana Air Base (US Government owned).  ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius?  PD));2016-01-24 18:10:00;15 minutes;Walked outside & the object caught my attention.  I live behind Oceana Air Base (US Government owned), so my 1st thought was it was probably an airplane.  I could see that it was a very bright white light that had flashing red lights & what appeared to be blue flashing lights also.  It was relatively stationary.  I am about 5 miles away & only had my phone, so no photos unfortunately. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a twinkling star, and perhaps Sirius.  PD));36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
Up up and away;2016-04-23 03:00:00;1 hour;Up up and away Hello I live in military housing in oceana, I woke up to use the bathroom and I notice how bright the moon was, I laid down began praying and staring at the stars.  I thought to myself how beautiful they are.   As I laid back in my bed trying to fall asleep I noticed a small object with red lights go straight up it began blinking white I thought I was tripping almost falling out the bed to stare.  I then woke up all the way up and began staring at the sky and saw three more they were acting as stars and just went straight up I could see what looked like smoke as they went straight up and disappeared   I know how this story sounds but it's true and scary because now I know there's something that comes in our universe and leaves.

Long-pause strobe?;2019-02-24 21:00:00;3 minutes;Long-pause &quotstrobe&quot? Enjoying the first clear night in a week, I noticed a bright white flash in the sky. It was brighter than the stars but only a pinpoint.  It did not light up the area or the sky.  Not sure what I had seen, I payed close attention to that area and roughly 3 minutes later the same area of the sky, size and and duration white flash.  Not sure what to make of this irregular, long pause strobe.  I know what aircraft look like both coming and going but this was not typical to what I've seen living less than a half mile from NAS.  Any ideas, NUFORC?;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
Pink brown floating jellyfish over Virginia beach;2020-08-14 00:20:00;5 minutes;Pink brown floating jellyfish over Virginia beach Me and my roommate were outside enjoying the night when I spotted what I thought was a bag floating in the wind. As it got closer both me and my roommate could only describe it as a pink/brown jelly fish floating in the air as if it was water . Its slowed as we watched it as it changed direction and moved faster and it floated away.  Me and my roommate both ran out to the street but when we got out to the street it a floated a huge distance within seconds.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
