A silver cylinder hovering in the sky near Oceana Naval Air Station.;2001-01-30 12:30:00;2 minutes;A silver cylinder hovering in the sky near Oceana Naval Air Station. While driving west on I 264 near Oceana NAS, I saw a long silver sylinder sitting horizontally and motionless in the sky.  I thought that's wierd when I realized it fit a ufo description of a silver cigar shape object. The top and bottom were straight and each end was slightly rounded.  There was a clear reflective highlight from the sun that ran the length of the object.  I noticed the traffic slowed down.  Other drivers must have also seen it. It was a clear sunny day at about noon.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
