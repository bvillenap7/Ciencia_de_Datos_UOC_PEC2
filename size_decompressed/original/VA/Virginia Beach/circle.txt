Bright flash and blue ring of fire emitting vapor trail;1993-04-15 03:00:00;1 min;Bright flash and blue ring of fire emitting vapor trail I was a military police officer at Fort Story Virginia. At the time of this sighting, myself and my partner were putting delineators in the road for a bike race or marathon the next day, I can't remember which. Anyway, I was driving the truck, and he was in the back dropping the delineators on the road. We were moving very slowly.Suddenly there was a bright blue flash, like the world's biggest flash bulb. My partner yelled Look!. At the same time I stopped the truck and got out. My partner was standing in the bed of the truck pointing at an object that I can only describe as a ring of blue fire, hollow in the middle, moving up very rapidly. It had a small vapor trail following it. Then it disappeared.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125

It was evening, it flew west, made a very sharp turn up, another sharp turn west, and then vanished.  I laughed when I told my family that they even have a cloaking devise. It looked like a round fuzzy object, but that may have just been the distance. I'm sure you receive many reports.  If you see any relevance, you may contact me.  Otherwise, I still have my memory of seeing something I don't believe anyone on this planet has accomplished.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
3 starish kind of things, orangish, in a formation of a triangle.  ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD));2008-02-28 22:02:00;5-10 mins;3 starrish kind of things, orangish, in a formation of a triangle. It was Thursday the 28th around 10 o’clock pm and I was getting ready to go upstairs.  Before I did I went to the back door to make sure its locked and I saw 3 bright reddish orangish things in the sky flickering like a candle. They were in the formation of a triangle and at first I thought it was the big dipper.  Then I ran upstairs really quick and showed my uncle out his bathroom window and there were only two left but really spaced apart, yet they still kept flickering.  We watched for about 5 minutes and one of them slowly disappeared then the last one.  I left when they all vanished but my uncle said there were planes chasing them.  And that was the end of the night.  Until the next morning I forgot totally about it and one of my classmates brought it up. We talked about the sighting and we had the same exact description. She said she was with her boyfriend and a car full of people, so she knew she wasn’t crazy. Once we talked about them, we knew they were UFO’s. ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.

Possible UFO sighting. Unknown. Orange/dimming ball. Went across the beach towards the ocean.;2011-08-26 20:00:00;About 3 minutes;Possible UFO sighting. Unknown. Orange/dimming ball. Went across the beach towards the ocean. It was possible that it was a UFO, but I am not too sure.  I was walking on Sand fiddler Road in Virginia on vacation when i saw this glowing orange ball in the sky going across the beach.  I believe the duration of the sighting was about 2 to 3 minutes.  It was glowing for a while then it made a quick right towards the water and dimmed away.  Then it was nowhere to be seen.  I'm not too sure if it was a Chinese lantern or not.  According to a friend we told, she said it could of been one of those.  But who knows, so this is my report which is unprofessional.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
Multi-colored spot of bright light near oceanfront/Dam Neck Naval Station;2012-10-23 02:00:00;30 minutes or more;Multi-colored spot of bright light near oceanfront/Dam Neck Naval Station Woke up to what sounded like a police or military helicopter flying over my hosue around 2am. Disappeared after that.  Looking towards the ocean (East) from Lynnhaven and Holland i could see a bright low spot of light.  Thought it was a planet but it appeared to have multi-colored lights and it appears to sort of &quotjump&quot around the sky.  Didnt move much but just enough to know it was not a star/planet.  Tried taking photos with my 400mm lens but came out blurry of course. But my photos showed just about every color in the spectrum.  Freaked me out.  Turned radio scanner to military base channels and didnt hear any talk about aircraft. Ill be looking tonight to see if its there again...;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125

One bright traveling light splits into two in Virginia Beach sky.;2014-02-22 18:55:00;2 seconds;One bright traveling light splits into two in Virginia Beach sky We were driving on the highway where the sky is completely visible with no trees.  All the way towards the right, a bright light the size of an meteor and as bright as a planet suddenly appeared.  The color was white, like an LED lightbulb.  When I saw it at first I yelled, Look, a shooting star!  Quickly, I realized it was not a star.  Most of the stars were hardly visible from light pollution from the street lights.  It didn't flicker or flash like stars, planes or towers.  It seems much closer, bigger, and brighter than any of the stars.  After about 1 second, it split into two and one light went up and one went down creating a sideways Y.  This was a perfect triangle formation.  In about 1/3 of a second it completely disappeared.  When the light divided into two they were equally as bright and big as the original one was.  They disappeared in perfect sync, down to the millisecond.  I'd estimate it was about 1/2-1 mile away.  During the event, I didn't feel anything other than amazement and awe. The two witnesses were myself and my father.  Neither of us have ever been to interested in UFOs, so it was not like we would be looking for that sort of thing.

I took my dog outside. It was a clear night, windy at 21.9mph. Looking to the South I saw 2 stars and at first, what I thought to be a plane but through further observation, I knew it wasn't a plane. I am a veteran, worked in the airline industry and have hundreds of hours worth of flight time, I have also lived in a military town for most of my life next to an airbase and civilian airport, this was NOT an airplane,a helicopter,a flare, a later or a drone. I watched as the circular glowing object, making no noise ascend straight up at a constant speed. I watched the object for a few minutes as it continued to climb and then it just blacked out or disappeared at a great height.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
