Orange lights seen moving very fast across the sky above the clouds from east to west.;2004-03-03 22:05:00;10 seconds;Orange lights seen moving very fast across the sky above the clouds from east to west. Standing in our back yard looking in the night sky for Neptune, we observed orange singular boomarang shaped objects that seemed to follow one another in a surpentine shape that flew above the clouds.  First observed in the Eastern sky then they appeared to move very quickly across to the Western sky without loosing their equal position with each other.  This only lasted about 10 seconds and they were gone.  No sound or trail coming from them.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
multiple dark shades in an otherwise clear blue sky above high rise;2008-01-05 12:00:00;picture;multiple dark shades in an otherwise clear blue sky above high rise I have never seen a UFO but this picture is rather strange.  I have heard that some pictures used with high quality film pick up traces of phenomena that would not otherwise be seen.  This picture is from a Real Estate listing Agency attempting to sell high priced high rise units in the newly built Town Center VB area.   I am a contractor and was interested in seeing the build out of the place-not to look at any anything else!  Might be nothing, but thought you might give it a look.  Please keep in mind the Edgar Cayce Center is just miles down the road from this location.

Unknown line of white lights moving slowly to the North North East;2013-09-24 05:43:00;5 minutes;Unknown line of white lights moving slowly to the North North East On September 24, 2013 at 0543 hours, I was walking to my car to go to work and looked up and saw 7 white lights in a straight line moving slowly to the north north east.  The sky was clear above me with a few clouds on the horizon. The lights moved in a steady slow pace with no sound. The lights had an occasional Flash, much like a strobe light.  I looked for red and green navigational lights that are on airplanes and could not see any. The spacing of the lights remained constant during the movement and I could not tell if it was one large object or several objects since it was still dark. I lost sight of the object at 0548 hours and proceeded to work.  This occurred over the Windsor Oaks area of Virginia Beach, Virginia.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
