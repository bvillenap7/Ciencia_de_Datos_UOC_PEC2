VA Beach shore drive.  Cigar-shape 8' off ground yellow lights.  ((anonymous report));2016-09-23 20:32:00;Seconds;Virginia Beach shore drive.  Cigar shape 8' off ground yellow lights. Caught on motion camera 8:30 just at dark.  5 seconds.  Craft cigar shaped with two whitish orange lights on either end approx 3 feet wide.   Seemed to have a red infrared type beam on ground even after the craft left frame.  Flashed from somewhat dim to bright one time for about half second.   Have blurry zoom of it.  Some kind of appendage on top but can't tell.  Moved fast between house trees.  Too fast and small an area to be a drone in my opinion.   Came into view by shed, flashed and quickly but efficiently moved away avoiding trees and fences.  Motion was almost scary as it departed.   Clear night 8 ' off of ground 20 feet from camera.  No sound recorded camera inside.  No red or green navigation lights that I could see.   Across from JEB naval base.   Good video of it hovering and departing.

Large, silent, stadium light high, floating completely still appearance of commercial aircraft so CLOSE to me it can't be dismissed;2016-10-28 21:37:00;37 seconds;Large, silent, stadium li evght high, floating completely still appearance of commercial aircraft so CLOSE to me it can't be dismissed First thought was a commercial plane (in appearance and color, shape yada yada), then took notice it wasn't moving, it was only 6 stories high {just above the stadium lights} and also it was silent.  It had white lights running across the bottom, with a couple of red lights on both ends.  Once, my brain concluded it was not behavior of any known plane that large to hover silently that low, was not a helo, was not a drone (unless it's a million dollar drone that was as big as a commercial plane and capable of holding completely still).  As I was quickly trying to call boss and yell down to another employee to see if either of them was seeing what I was seeing, running down the ramp from 2nd floor as I kept an eye on it.  I looked away for approx. 4 seconds as I looked for the other employee or anyone to tell them to look up, it was gone.  I ran back up the ramp and asked a group of men watching the football game if they had seen a blimp or anything fly over the field.  They said they were looking downward to the game. In my 54 years I have never seen anything like it and so close that I know what it wasn't.  This same location on different nights in Oct and Nov others and I have witnessed green glowing falling stars 3 feet off the ground, and tree line yellow and white ones on other occasions.  More activity in this one location then I have seen in my entire 54 years. The large aircraft continued to bother me as I had no explanation for what I AM SURE I SAW. I don't drink nor do drugs. Thus, still wanting answers, I entered some keywords into search engine and to my surprise others across the state of VA have described the same craft at about same tree line area, silent with the lights across the bottom. I wonder how many people see unexplainable things and don't report for fear of being labeled as mentally disturbed.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
Virginia Beach UFO.;2016-12-10 20:41:00;<1 minute;Virginia Beach UFO. At approximately, 8:41PM on December 10, 2016, I exited my car to enter my house in Virginia Beach, VA.  I was facing east and I saw something moving across the sky in a south by southwest direction, so it was moving from my left to my right at an angle from in front of me to behind me.  It stopped me in my tracks because I had never seen anything like it in the sky before. The object appeared to be the size and shape of a Tylenol extra strength tablet. It had lights on the front and back.  The lights appeared to be fluttering like in a haze.  The object appeared to be gliding across the sky at a pretty high speed, and there was no noise that I could hear. It took me a few seconds to compute what I was looking at, and I was able to rule out many explanations in my mind.  It was not an airlines jet, it was to big in the sky and no airport in that direction.  I thought maybe it was a helicopter behind the clouds, but a quick look around and I could see many stars and constellations, so I quickly ruled out cloud cover.  The absence of noise also helped me rule out a helicopter, as well as a military jet, which do fly in our area but are very noisy.  The lights were not flashing like the normal air traffic in the sky.  The lights were dull and hazy like they were fluttering. I then got my cellphone out to video.  While trying to keep my eyes on the quick moving target I also tried to zoom.  By the time I got the camera on the object, it was far off to my right and I only was able to film the back side of the object. The entire event was less than 1 minute about 10 seconds for me to process and decide to video and the 31 seconds of footage. I had just returned from dinner with my mother.  I had not been drinking and was not under the influence of any narcotics. After the event, I went into my house and called my mother, then my sister, then my son to tell them what I had seen.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125

While driving home in the afternoon, I watched two Navy Jets making their approach to Oceana that appeared to be followed be a pencil shaped object.  Jets donâ€™t tow pencil shaped objects.  I lost sight of all three over a tree line as they made a turn towards air base.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
