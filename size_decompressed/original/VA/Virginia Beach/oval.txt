I knew it wasnt a military craft when it went from slow to stop to zipping in the sky but it never left our eyesight and never disssapeared. We observed the craft for about 45min to an hour and couldnt believe I was seeing it. ive always known they existed and was always waiting for my chance to actually see one which I did and am now telling you guys. They are trully amazing. It was so high in the night sky it appeared as a star would except it was dancing some kinda strange. --Thankyou p.s. My family doesnt believe me and now I am ridiculed for seeing it but I dont care I know the truth of what I saw that night.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
orange lights in southern VA;2008-02-07 11:30:00;15 minutes;orange lights in southern VA Upon getting home from work, the couple next door was staring into the sky. I thought they had to much too drink. when I got out of my truck the guy said hey we have been watching these strange lights move slowly across the sky. I looked up into the southern sky and saw what appeared to be 3 to 4 orange lights at a very high attitude, much higher then a helicoper can fly and they where moving very slowly back and forth. I grabbed my girlfriend and 2 pair of binocs and we both views this object for about 15 minutes until it ascended and disappeared from eye sight.  If anyone else saw this I would love to hear from you. I have drawn a few pictures of what we saw.  Thanx.

orb shaped, hovering UFO during the day in virginia beach on march 29, 2011.;2011-03-29 17:43:00;5 minutes;orb shaped, hovering UFO during the day in virginia beach on march 29, 2011. In the sky, while still daylight outside, me and one other person witnessed what seemed like a helicoptor without propellers or a tail hovering at a relatively low velocity, consistantly and maintaining the same altitude.  It was silent and it reflected the suns light at certain points and flashed a soft red and white light once or twice.  about 5 minutes after it disappeared in the distance, there was a plan traveling very slowly in the same direction as if it was tailing the ufo. i tried to video tape it but it was relatively small and somewhat far from us and nothing showed up in the video itself.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
Blue oval object over ocean in front of a lightning storm move at a high rate of speed.;2011-08-19 00:08:00;10 seconds;Blue oval object over ocean in front of a lightning storm move at a high rate of speed. It was approximately 12:08am EST on August 19, 2011, I was standing in my back yard watching the lightning storms over the ocean.  This is when I looked to the left (North East) and seen a blue oval shaped object moving at great speed about 10 degrees above the horizon, just above the roof tops of the houses in the distance.  It moved north east to south west. The object was about the size of a 20 millimeter bb, it was oval and moved in a straight line across the sky from north east to south west.  It was moving very fast, it took less than 10 seconds to move across the sky and my view.  At this time there was and commercial aircraft moving towards it. The commercial aircraft was much higher in the sky.  It was at about 60 degrees above the horizon and you could see the FAA required lights along with the shape.  Commercial aircraft have to fly at higher altitudes due to the military base Iâ€™m close to.  Also, the speed of the commercial aircraft was much slower than the object. The object was in front of the storm because you could see the lightning storm and clouds behind it. There also was no sound.  I also could not hear the commercial aircraft either, but I could see the moon, stars, the commercial aircraft, and clouds very clearly.  The storm in the distance was over the ocean.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
White &quotclouds&quot merge into translucent shape;2019-12-18 08:09:00;1 minute;White &quotclouds&quot merge into translucent shape Mostly clear morning, looked up and saw what looked like two small white clouds very high in the atmosphere.  The two clouds were floating very quickly, faster than a typical plane that high up.  The white lines moved closer together until parallel, then merged into a translucent oval with white edges which faded.  I looked away for a moment and looked back and could no longer see the apparition-like structure.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
