Vertical craft seen over Atlantic Ocean, Virginia Beach;2019-06-13 17:11:00;~5-10 minutes;Vertical craft seen over Atlantic Ocean, Virginia Beach Exact longitude and latitude at time of sighting: 36.854750, -75.969278.  I was deep-sea fishing on a commercial boat off the coast of Virginia Beach in 2019. Things are - granted - fuzzy, as I was on some decently strong psychotropic medication at the time. Luckily, I had the foresight to snap a picture, which jogged my memory wholly in the recent days - being swept up by the UAP information being released. The incident stuck out in my mind due to recent news revealing that there's been a significant amount of sightings over the ocean.  When I say was fuzzy I do mean it. I was out on the boat for maybe anywhere from one to two hours, and I had downloaded some podcasts to listen to while out fishing. It felt as though in one moment there was nothing - and the next moment I looked up, there was an oddly vertical craft almost hovering above the water. The craft didn't seem to move strongly in any direction, almost hanging perfectly still directly in the center of my vision. As I mentioned before, I had the foresight to snap a photo. Just about everything around the photo is useful - except for the damn image itself. What was incredibly apparent was that the object was very large and decently far away. It was a clear as clear could be on that day, however, so there was absolutely zero mistaking it. The craft appears very blurry in the image, however, there's relevant detail that was automatically stored when I had taken the image due to the Google Photos app's data storage.  https://ibb.co/VWnNw16 --- Here is a link to the image, you can check it on whatever site you'd want, ibb is a site I use personally.  The shape of the object was hard to pin down. I've tried doing some googling for similar images in the recent weeks and there's only one I seem to keep coming back to for the most accurate comparison of what I saw in the sky.  https://ibb.co/dQPp7sw  Imagine if that craft was rotated ~45 degrees or so on its z axis. That's the closest thing I could describe it to. A pointy, vertically-oriented black craft hovering in the sky. Even in my haze, I had mentally ruled out the possibilities of it being a singular bird (too big) or a helicopter (no visible rotors or obvious means of propulsion). Do with this info what you will - as a rule of thumb I'm not particularly interested in any sort of publicity, even though you may do with the info what you see fit to. I was not particularly interested in showing it to anyone at the time out of fear of stigmatization and am still not very interested in having my name attached to it. The fact of the matter is, however, that this incident has stuck with me for years - and it should be seen by someone given the recent breakthroughs and some amateur research done by me that has pinned Virginia Beach as a ufo hotspot in recent years.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
