White, spherical object moving in a NW trajectory, silent, moving extremely fast.;1997-03-10 12:30:00;8-10sec.;Summary : White, spherical object moving in a NW trajectory, silent, moving extremely fast. On March 10, 1997,went outside after lunch for a brief walk.Cloudless, clear day.  Looked up and noticed a single, very white, round objectmoving from east to northwest (this is a coastal area of VA).  At first thought itwas baloon, but quickly realized moving much too fast and straight.  No vapor,exhaustor noise whatsoever.  When first observed, appeared to be about the size of a shirtbutton held at arm's length.  Disappeared within 8-10 seconds.This area is close to Naval air stations very familiar with various conventionalcraft.  Nothing like this seen before.  Was very round and bright white.I am a 46 year-old health care executive.  Am MUFON member (recently joined) have beeninterested in the phenomenon for decades, and well read on subject, but maintain a sceptical yet open mind.Inclined to favor a more scientific, empirical approach.This was definitely NO conventional craft!;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
I saw it too!;2003-06-15 19:00:00;60 seconds;I saw it too! I just submitted a report of an incident that happened to me in Charlotte, NC.  I made a reference to another incident that I had when I lived in Virginia Beach.  I was looking through your posts to see if I saw anything that was similar to what I saw and found report:  Occurred : 6/15/2003 19:00 (Entered as : 06/15/03 19:00)  Reported: 4/1/2010 9:00:03 PM 21:00  Posted: 4/13/2010  Location: Virginia Beach, VA  Shape: Fireball  Duration:3-5 minutes   This report describes exactly what I saw other than the changing colors. I lived right off of Kempsville Road which intersects Indian River.  If this person was near this intersection, then I think we were possibly viewing the same event.  I know that the front of my home faced the direction of the intersection of Indian River/Kempsville Road.  If they were observing this from facing the driection of Centerville Tpk, then I know this has to be the same incident. I know that the weather was warm outside and it was late evening right about when the sun was about an hour from full set. Whatever I saw made the same irregular movements...up/down...left/right...and also had that faint trail of light that followed it.  (There was a small tornado in Kempsriver Shopping Center that is right at the intersection of Indian River Road and Kempsville Road.  I was on my front porch when this tornado had formed and could see it clearing forming in the sky from my porch so I know that it is ! very well possible that this person, if they were facing toward my home at that time could see what I was seeing....Facing my house, the incident took place to the left of my house.  If the person who reported this was traveling on Indian River traveling towards Kempsville, then they were facing toward my home.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
3rd night of Orb sighting in Larkspur area of  Virginia Beach;2005-11-02 18:45:00;2 minutes;3rd night of Orb sighting in Larkspur area of  Virginia Beach This was the third night in a row that I had witnessed an “orb,” passing over my house, following roughly Edwin Drive at an altitude of about 1,000 ft. The first night we witnessed the same object approximately at 7:00pm while trick or treating with my wife, my neighbor’s wife and our children. All three of us witnessed the object traveling in the same direction height etc. I witnessed the object again on 11/1/05 around same time and on the third evening I was outside and it appeared again. I ran to my truck and got my Nikon D70 digital camera and quickly tried to focus it on the object, while resting the camera on the hood of my truck to steady the camera. The camera had trouble auto-focusing and I switched the auto mode to sports, and was able to get three pictures, 2 of the object and the third of nothing many seconds later. I have the RAW – NEFF pictures for anyone who wants to analyze them, however you will need Nikon Capture 4 software to view the images. My neighbor wants nothing to do with this, nor does my wife. An unknown man near to us during the Halloween sighting on 10/31/05, exclaimed, “It is a UFO!,” but we don’t know who he was, he was not from our neighborhood. After I did a radio interview on Coast to Coast, a Suffolk man contacted me and described seeing the objects again three nights in a row. This is not the first time I have seen orbs traveling in this direction (roughly South to North) a friend and I practically chased one in the daytime in the fall of 2000. I have since learned how to set the parameters on my camera and will be ready the next time to hopefully get better pictures. I have been told that digital pictures are not as reliable as film photos, but still a pretty good amount of detail and authenticity should be able to be gleaned from these two photos by those who know what they are doing, since I have no background or experience in this type of research.

Metallic sphere floating 20 feet in air in Virgina Beach;2007-02-10 15:00:00;15-20 seconds;Metallic sphere floating 20 feet in air in Virgina Beach I was skateboarding over to my friends house through my neighborhood near the beach.  I was going down a straight street with houses on either side.   I looked to my left and saw a metallic sphere a little larger than a basketball floating about 20 feet in the air.  It was going in a straight path at about 5 or 10mph.  It went between 2 houses, over me and then between 2 other houses on the side of the road.   Upon looking at Google Earth later in I saw that the path it was taking was due east.  It was really eerie, and gave me crazy chills down my spine when it flew directly over me.  It made no sound and it looked like a giant floating pinball,  but it didn’t seem be reflecting anything, it was just intensely shiny.  It looked like something you would see in a movie, except only it was real and it caught me completely off guard. ((NUFORC Note:  Report submitted by student.  PD));36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
A bright light that came closer to photographer with each camera flash green, orange and violet haze around the orb.;2007-10-15 03:00:00;60 minutes;A bright light that came closer to photographer with each camera flash green, orange and violet haze around the orb. Several dogs at a nearby kennel started barking in a defensive manner.  We went to the backyard to see why they were barking and a bright, hovering light was seen in the sky.  It radiated green, orange and violet auras.   As we began to take pictures, it appeared to be moving closer to our location with each camera flash and then would fall back when the flashes stopped.   I would have reported this sooner if I would have know about this website. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

huge moon like blue white spheres  flashed in night sky accompanied by loud booms;2009-03-29 21:45:00;1 to 2 minutes;huge moon like blue white spheres  flashed in night sky accompanied by loud booms I saw a bright flash of light ,I went to my window and saw a huge moon like sphere of blue white light flash very bright and smaller sphere shoot out backwrds from the larger sphere as it flashed bright again. Then there was a huge percussion werid sounding booms that followed. Minutes later I saw what I thought was an aircraft flashing from blue to red to green it moved quickly left and then backwards it stopped and stayed in place about 30 to 40 minutes then I saw jets flying in the area and it disappeared. The brillant flash was seen in three states. Some saw a green fire ball I did not see that, what I saw was the flashing spheres, it may have been our location. The media first thought it was a meteorite now they are saying it may have been space junk. I doubt that as Norad keeps track of that. I believe what I saw was 2 very different ufo's. I had never see anything like this before. And I have never heard of space junk or meteorites being seen across three states either, I am convinced it was a major ufo event.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125

Sphere seen traveling at a high rate of speed over  Virginia Beach;2010-11-17 05:32:00;20 Seconds;Sphere seen traveling at a high rate of speed over  Virginia Beach While driving to work this morning, I noticed a bright light moving from west to east at an extremely fast pace.   My initial thought was that I was observing a meteor, but it wasn’t displaying any characteristics of what I know from seeing meteors in the past.   This sphere traveled in a straight line over the horizon, and then all at once, it shot upwards then shot straight down over the tree line.  From my vantage point, it seemed to pass just south of Oceana Naval Air Station but this was too fast for any jet I’ve ever seen.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
Colored round balls of green and orange over the skies of virginia beach VA;2012-04-18 19:00:00;15 to 20 seconds;colored round balls of green and orange over the skies of virginia beach VA It was a round ball like object ,cigarette ash orange in color.  The sighting lasted about 15 to 20 seconds moving across the southeastern sky / 3 nights prior in the northeastern sky a bright green ball like object was seen for about same duration .  I estimate object to be 15-20 feet in diameter.  There is a navy air base around 1 mile from sighting but it was no plane.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
Bright orange orbs off VA Beach, VA coast.;2012-11-22 21:02:00;8 minutes;Bright orange orbs off VA Beach, VA coast My wife and I live on the beach just south of Dam Neck Naval Base.   We saw 2 bright orange orbs move from the north to the south along the coast.   The 2 orbs went away and a third appeared in the same area of the first two.   Several neighbors were outside and we heard their gasps of surprise and then heard them speculating on what we were all actually seeing.   My wife is very upset by this.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
Small orb like object, made quick sharp turns, very very fast and from my vantage point appeared to be red.;2013-11-18 19:45:00;5 seconds;Small orb like object, made quick sharp turns, very very fast and from my vantage point appeared to be red. The event occured the night of the launch from Wallops Island on November 18, 2013.  The time was between 1930 and 1945.  I'm sure of the time because while headed to class I heard about the launch on the radio.  Class normally ends at 1930 but I left early (around 1915) to make sure I was out of the building before the launch took place.  I didn't see the launch, but as I was was preparing to turn into my neighborhood I saw a red orb like craft flying (I'm not good with directions) so I'll have to use my home as a point of reference.  I'm on the street heading toward my home and my home was on the right side of the street.   The craft approached from the far right of my home and was headed left and would have passed in front of me but it veered sharp right and ended directly in front but above me.  It wasn't flying very high...it was low and close enough for me to see that it was round and was red or from the rear was red.  There was no sound and it was moving very very fast.  It did not appear to have many lights, the object itself appeard to be red.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
White orb in the sky (anonymous).;2019-02-18 13:30:00;Unknown;White orb in the sky (anonymous) My son and I were sitting in the car in our driveway.  We had just arrived back home from doing some errands.  While sitting in the car I pointed out the clouds overhead and told him that it looked like an alien.  We both laughed and I decided to take a picture of the clouds to show his younger brother.  It was amusing.  We went inside and then carried in the rest of our groceries.   As we sat down and looked back at the photographs (one taken right after the other), we noticed that there was an white orb in the sky and that it had moved from its location in the first picture to another location in the second frame.  They were both snapped at the same time, one right after the other with my cell phone.  Neither of us saw the orb in the sky at the time, it was not the moon -- the moon doesn't move, plus we went back outside to look up at the sky to see if we could see the object.  It was gone.  It looks like there are lights inside of the orb.  Very strange.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
