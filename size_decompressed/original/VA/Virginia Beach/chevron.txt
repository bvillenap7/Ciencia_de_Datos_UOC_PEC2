The lights were in a V shape equadistant from each other with the bright light at the point of the V. The lights were moving together at the same speed. As I watched the lights moved north at a slow rate of speed and the V seemed to stand on one wing as the lights turned east from the former northern heading. As I watched all lights moved together and kept the same relative spacing. The lights were fairly low in the sky and if connected would have outlined a fairly large craft. I would estimate several hundred feet per side. 5 lights in a V formation (appx 90degrees), one bright light at the point of the V and 2 smaller less bright lights on either side. The lights were low on the horizon and were moving slowly in a northerly direction, then turned and began to move in an easterly direction. In executing the turn it was as if the lights were connected as the lights seemed to execute a steep bank to the right with the V seeming to stand on one leg as an airplane would to make a sharp turn. The lights did not change speed as they turned. The lights were white and round. The distance to the lights I would estimate at a maximum of one mile The size of the V I would estimate to be several hundred feet per leg. I could not see any connection between the lights. There was no sound associated with the sighting;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
sighting during lunar eclipse;2003-11-08 19:30:00;45 seconds;sighting during lunar eclipse As myself, my husband and my 2 children were watching the lunar eclipse, only my 13 year old son and I saw at the same time, an almost V-shaped object of dim light glide across the sky under the moon from left to right. I asked my husband if he saw it and by the time I had looked away and tried to point it out, it had gone. I was thrilled when my son said he had seen it also and we had seen the same exact thing. No flashing lights, no sound.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
Bright light seen in Virginia Beach;2008-10-22 03:00:00;3-5 minutes;Bright light seen in Virginia Beach   I was taking my dog outside when I saw a bright, cross shaped UFO hovering over my apartment complex. I watched it for a minute or so, then went inside to get a camera but I left my dog outside. When I came back out,the UFO was still there, so I turned on the camera, but by the time I snapped the picture it was gone. My dog was nowhere to be found. Minnie (the dog) always stays close by, so I am convinced that the craft abducted my dog. The craft appeared to have a relatively low altitude, probably 1000ft. There were no discernible features other than the V shape and bright lights. I did not hear any abnormal sounds during the entire encounter. I have contacted VA Beach PD and they think I am just a nuisance and will not process my report. I am left with no other options. Please help me. I would prefer to be contacted by email due to the nature of my work. I can't predict who will be around me, and some of my coworkers have been very unsupportive of my situation.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
Very distinct flash in the eyes beam of light directing me towards the &quotstar&quot object darting through sky;2013-02-14 19:06:00;1 minute;Very distinct flash in the eyes beam of light directing me towards the &quotstar&quot object darting through sky This is my first official report though I've had many sightings in my life. This one stood out so I felt the need to report it.   I was casually going outside for a smoke when directly in my field of vision as if it were imprinted on my eyes was a flash that looked like basically ^ that an upside down v basically and it was bright yellow in the middle fading to orange with a black stripe strongly in the middle of the shape I guess you could say it was closer to a triangle or just a really thick upside down v.   At that point I saw a beam stretch skyward directing my attention to what looked like a star that darted up towards the moon but then quickly darted left.   I gazed at the sky for a while to see if anything else stood out but that was it.   Thank you for reviewing my report.   As a note anyone wishing to contact me please do so by email not by phone thank you.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
