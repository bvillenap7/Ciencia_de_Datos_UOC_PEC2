My husband and I were traveling south in Virginia Beach.  I looker west and saw two objects flying to the south.  At first I thought they were jets with vorticies.  As my husband looked at the objects, he stated that jets vorticies is not golden-red in color.   We watch the objects travel for about 10 minutes.  They appeared to be moving further west and soon left our sight.  They were unbelievably bright and big, they were both traveling at the same speed and in the same direction.  Our first UFO sighting and it was great.  Have no idea what they were.  My husband says meteors,  I THINK NOT!;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
a ball of light shot over my head.;1999-09-17 23:55:00;seconds;a ball of light shot over my head. I was on Strikland blvd. on my way to work at 23:55.  I was making my final turn into the parking lot and I saw a small green ball of light heading south west for only a fraction of a second. It was about the size of a bb, haloed with yellow with a pointed yellow orange tail. the tail was longer than the ball. I work overnights at a 7-11, and foodeservice during the day.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
Glowing fireball type orb with a tail of some sort, with strange movements, and then unimaginable speed to disapear.;2003-06-15 19:00:00;3-5 minutes;Glowing fireball type orb with a tail of some sort, with strange movements, and then unimaginable speed to disapear. My dad was driving in our truck and I was in the passanger seat.  We were stopped at a left turn signal on Indian River Rd.  While we were waiting for the light to change out of the corner of my eye I saw a bright circular object, at first i thought it was the full moon, but it was not the moon.  I looked at the object and I was glowing bright white to orange to redish colors, almost as if it was on fire.  There was also a tail somewhat like a comet's tail coming of of the back of it.  The way this object moved though could not have been a comet, or a rocket.  My dad was watching it as well once I pointed it out to him.  He is a high level navy Senior Cheif and now works in a control tower for a nearby base.  The object sometimes just floated, there seemed to be no sound whatsoever, and then it would make complex movements left to right, diagnoly, straight down, up, any way it wanted.  This lasted about 2 minutes. I looked at the car in front of us and noticed the couple in the car were also pointing to the object in the sky.  Soon after the object made some more maneuvers.  Then as if having the ability to accelerate to what I believe to be the speed of light, the orb, craft, object whatever it may have been.  Shot off at an amazing speed and in a matter of 1-2 seconds completely disapeared. This image has stuck in my head ever since and I dont think I will ever get an explanation for what we saw that night.  My father contacted Langley to see if any launches were scheduled for that day and there was nothing. My father works with many top officials now that he is retired and now a civilian working on base in the control tower.  He knows what we saw that night was nothing at least in military arsenal that has been released. This area has seen many sighting since then...  Including the lights and explosion seen and felt over va / nc in the last couple months or so.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
Brilliant orange light seemed to be emitting from something above as if it were propulsion.;2007-12-10 19:00:00;5 minutes;Brilliant orange light seemed to be emitting from something above as if it were propulsion. I was walking out to the car and saw what looked like an orange fireball. After looking a little closer, it was square in shape at the top and faded towards the ground. To me it looked like a sort of propulsion. The sky was dark and I couldn't see anything but the light. It was traveling away from me so I got in the car to go to my destination. As I drove I kept watching it. After it had taraveled some distance away I saw a second smaller light descend from the larger one. It disappeared below the tree line. The larger object then pulsated several times and disappeared. My step son also witnessed the object but I wouldn't want to speak for him in this report.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
this object was very high up and emmited no sound.!;2008-08-03 21:00:00;4 months;this object was very high up and emmited no sound.! it was on a very clear Sunday night around 9pm when i spotted a high altitude (Bright)orange orb with no tail moving in a straight line from west to east over top of me for about 1 minute. As it moved closer it slowly dimmed to an ember/amber color for 20 seconds and before it reached overhead and disappeared with no sound. that night i even saw many blinking jet liners and even a large meteor burning towards the earth like hot magnesium..no it didn't hit the ground ha ha. it lit up trees in front of me before i turned around and spotted the flaming rock, so that provided great references to the mysterious object i saw. it was not a plane and definitely not a meteor. ive seen this object four times in the past few months so its a common phenomena.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
((SERIOUS REPORT??))  We saw a strange light in the sky saw two strange looking men in a grocery store, one of which, I spoke with.;2008-09-15 21:00:00;20 minutes;We saw a strange light in the sky and on the same night, saw two strange looking men in a grocery store, one of which, I spoke with. Not sure of the exact date but sometime in september of 2008 many residents of Virginia Beach saw an unidentified object in the sky.  It looked like a fire in the sky that moved very slowly and suddenly disappeared.  Many people were outside viewing it and some were videotaping it, other residents from close by areas saw it too.  It was comming from the North/East over the oceanfront maybe?  It must have hung around for at least twenty minutes or so. But thats not where the story ends.  Later that night me and my Girlfriend, ((female's name deleted)) were shopping for groceries in the local Farm Fresh located on General Booth blvd.  I noticed a strange looking man walking past.  He was tall, caucasion, dressed in casual cloths and he was by himself but there was something strange about his eyes.  They looked a little out there. Heres a photo of what the eyes kind of looked like. http://daysofourlife.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/charles-manson.jpg  I walked passed and didn't really think too much of it except that guy looked weird. Then I saw another man caucasion, short, casual cloths-also alone, and he had the same eyes!  I became interested and followed him for a bit.  He walked over to the magazine section and was reading some magazine(didn't look to see which one), and I told ((woman's name deleted)) about what I had seen and she told me to go up to him and ask him for directions, so I did.  His movement was very erratic and he had his head lowered at an angle(which I also found strange). I told him that I was lost and needed to know the best way to get to the oceanfront.  He spoke in a strange accent(even though his english was perfect), the way it came out sounded very monotone and far away.  He didn't turn away from his magazine and wouldn't look me in the eyes, which I also found strange.  I will tell you this, as a person who is experianced in meditation and telepathy, the man gave off a very strange, unearthly energy that I cannot describe.  I felt hypnotized by his words.  I couldn't read anything from him except th! at I felt as if I was pulled in by his strange energy.  He told me that he wasn't from here and couldn't help me.  I felt tongue tied and couldn't bring myself to say anything else.  I walked away feeling hazy, as if the experiance had happened in a dream or something.  My hand were cold and I was shaking.  I told ((woman's name deleted)) about it and she insisted that she speak with him herself as her psychic powers are natural and mine are more developed.  By the time we had returned, he had disappeared.  I just wanted to leave, so we did.  Nothing else came out of the incident. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

Craft that was bright and looked like it was on fire was 300 yards away and came closer and I put a light on it, and it came closer.;2008-12-08 05:00:00;20min;A craft that was bright and looked like it was on fire was 300 yards away and came closer and I put a light on it, and it came closer. It happend a little after five AM. I was setting up for a duck hunt in Back Bay on December 8th 2008.  I was early and began putting out decoys and it was very very dark out.   I was faceing the opan water and out of nowhere a huge bright light the size of a small air plane came around a point off a cove it was the color of fire and extreamly bright and extrmaly fast.  It was no more than 300 yards away from me and it was moveing closer to me.  I had no lights on during this time.  As it came closer I became very scared and picked up my 2,000,000 power spotlight and pointed it at it.  As soon as i turned it on the light that was like fire went out.   Five minuites later, a dark shadowy figure which was silent, came within 50 yards of me i was so scared.  It was like it it knew it was spoted and then came to see what had made that light. and seconds latter it was gone, so i thought. I emmedittly called home to tell them what I had seen i was on the phone for about 15 minutes and while I was talking I saw the it agin and it was about .5 mile away and it was on or right above the water and in seconds it was in the sky and as high as the stars,  The whole incounter from beging to end was about 35-40 min.  Oddly before this while I paddled my duck boat out to the duck blind there was a small metor shower or some like that and then a few right after the event.  The fire like light was huge, bright, very fast, quite, and amazing.   I have never seen anything like this. terrifying but amazing.

Fire ball off I-264;2011-08-11 23:05:00;2 minutes;Fire ball off I-264 As I was driving to work on I-264 in Va Bch headed toward the 264-64 interchange, out of my left window right above the street lights I saw this orange fire ball just sitting in one place with its lights fizzing or flickering very fast.   To me it looked like an orange static ball just floating there in one spot.   It was approx. 200 feet off the ground and about a 1/4 of a mile from the highway.   There was other air traffic in the same area as the object but as they continued on their path the fireball stayed in the same spot.  Where the spotting took place there is alot of air traffic from Norfolk Intl and NAS Oceana.   I am in the Navy and I have worked on both F-18's and SH-60's and this was definitely not like anything I have ever seen in my life.

Small fiery orange sphere floats over Va Beach neighborhood and travels slowly, silently and steadily away.;2012-04-27 20:24:00;2-3 minutes;Small fiery orange sphere floats over Va Beach neighborhood and travels slowly, silently and steadily away. I usually walk my dog in the evenings after sunset/dark. I have been fascinated by being able to see the International Space Station during my walks (and subscribe to a NASA feed from http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/sightings/ that lets me know when I can see it) and I enjoy watching the stars and their different position in the sky at different times of the year. Tonight the moon and Venus are farther apart than the last two nights. As I was walking my dog tonight (in a neighborhood behind First Colonial High School in Virginia Beach), I saw an orange sphere floating approximately 50-100 feet above the street/sidewalk. It looked like a home-made see-through contraption that someone put a candle or some other heat source in to make it rise like a hot air balloon. It was only about a foot in diameter.  It seemed as if one of the neighbors had launched it from their back yard.  It floated in the air and slowly, steadily and silently rose and traveled northwestward toward Venus.  As it got farther and farther away, its course gradually became more westward.  It had no tail or exhaust or contrail, just a glowing orange sphere. It became smaller and smaller like the size of a star to the human eye and then was no longer visible. The total duration of this encounter was approximately 2-3 minutes.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
An orange-reddish light was seen over Virginia Beach.;2013-03-01 22:05:00;55 seconds;An orange-reddish light was seen over Virginia Beach. Me and my mother were in our car, driving back home when I spotted a strange light in the sky, hovering over a field to the left of the road.  I alerted my mom, who pulled into the left turn lane and opened the window.   The light had a reddish halo when initially spotted, however it faded away into a single bright orange light.  It made no sound throughout the entire encounter.  It remained like this for about 15 seconds, then started to move ESE over a suburb.  It seemed to float, effortlessly for about 10 seconds.   We took the left turn and followed as close as we could on this road, and then it paused again.  We saw the reddish halo for about 3 seconds, then it concentrated into the orange light.   After about 10 seconds, the light then seemed to change directions and move South.  This time it moved much quicker, and the movement seemed more forced.   It got smaller, and it was difficult to tell how far away it was at this point.  It then faded away and seemed to disappear into the clouds. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect an evening sighting, and have amended the time above, to reflect that fact.  We attempted to contact the witness, but were unable to do so.

They were all moving at the same speed in some kind of formation. Some of the lights would dim just a little bitbit but never went out.  They passed over us for about 6 minutes and then disappeared because of some trees.  To surprise i had one friend tell me she saw something similar but there was only about 5.

It moved on a flat horizontal plane.  At first I thought it was a plane with it’s tail on fire, but we heard no sound.  The object continued moving in a northward direction and then seemed to stop for a moment then turn eastward over the ocean.

We often have planes fly over our house because we are close to a naval base.  This was definitely not a plane.   I watched it pass over my house, moving higher and higher into the sky until it disappeared.  I turned the direction it came from and there was another object that looked the same.  It flew in the same path and disappeared in the same spot the other did.

If I had held my hand in front of me at arms length I could have blocked it out, so it wasn’t huge, but closer than I have ever seen a “falling star”. The tail was quite long, as well, and I could actually see fire trailing the object.  Again, it appeared to be very close to earth, flames were visible, and in the 5-7 seconds that the object was visible, I thought to myself, “This one is going to hit”. The fire trail turned into more of a black smoke trail as it descended behind some trees and a building and out of sight.  I waited a second or two for a sound or vibration indicative of a crash landing, but thankfully, none came.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
