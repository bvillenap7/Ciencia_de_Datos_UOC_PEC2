Black triangular object silently hovered in sky at cloud level for aprox 10 mins before the darkness of night and storm obscured it.;2002-06-06 20:15:00;about 10 mins;Black triangular object silently hovered in sky at cloud level for aprox 10 mins before the darkness of night and storm obscured it. went to meet a friend for a walk on the board walk to observe the storm coming in from the north and west, looked up at the sky to the south which was gray but still quite light and saw a black triangular object in the sky.  This being a navy town my mind immediatly assumed that it was a fighterplane but i realized that it did not move.  This black triangle occupied exactly the same spot in the sky while i walked 2 blocks, stopped a neighbor and asked her if she saw something, she looked and said what is it? i said i don't know, she decided it was a kite and went back into her apartment.  the object still had not moved a bit, it was high enough in the sky for the clouds to occassionaly pass between the object and the ground but did not obscure it.  I walked the rest of the way to the boardwalk to meet my friend, but in that 5 minutes the stormy sky became too dark to see the object.

A jet-black triangle with white lights at it's corners and one flashing in the center which emmitted a haunting sound.;2003-03-06 02:00:00;three minutes;A jet-black triangle with white lights at it's corners and one flashing in the center which emmitted a haunting sound. I was coming home in a friend's car from the 7-11 just up the street from my house late in the night when I first noticed the object.  From a distance it appeared stationary over my neighborhood with one extremely bright white light on each side of an equally bright flashing white light.  This was a head-on view of the object.  We continued down the street heading straight for it, still hearing no discernable noise from the object.  As we came up on it, the object was blocked out by a pine tree just a little further up on my side of the car, so we decided to stop right there in the middle of the sreet.  When the craft emerged from behind the tree in line with the car we were stunned at how low and silent it was traveling, it seemed to be just above the top of the tree making no engine noise at all.  This was when I got a full view of the craft, which appeared to be a jet-black triangle against the black sky with three brilliant solid white lights at the points and one flashing white light at the center.  As my friend and I watched the thing creep by, we tried fumbling with a disposable camera but it wasn't working.  The object seemed to have been going in a slow straight line for the entire time we had observed it.  When it passed directly in front of me I tried to get out and have a better look, but as soon as I popped the door and had a foot out, the object immediately veered to it's left and emitted a sound like nothing I've ever heard.  The only way I can describe the noise is that it was like a chilling high-pitched scream, not like a jet engine which I'm very familiar with living near military installations for my entire life, but a howling that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.  After turning, the object picked up speed and passed over the top of a house in a small court on my right and was gone.  We tried catching up with the object out on the main road and back through our neighborhood, but it was as if the thing saw us looking at it and then disappeared.  I estima! te the triangle was at least fifty feet wide on it's sides, I can't really judge the thickness of the craft having seen just mostly the underside, and I'd say that it was at an altitude of no more than 100-150 feet, traveling parallel with the ground.  The object was in my plain view for about thirty seconds and observed altogether for about three minutes.  I have never seen or heard anything like it before or since.  A few weeks ago though I came accross some UFO footage and photos of the Belgium and France triangle flaps which exactly matched the head-on view and underside view and the lighting of the craft I saw.  Viewing the footage really helped put to rest the last remaining doubts I had about what I witnessed.  I credit this sighting with sparking my interest into the reality of UFO's, which I now feel can no longer be denied.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
((POSSIBLE HOAX)) A triangular craft with solid red and flashing white lights hovering strangely over Virginia Beach, VA late at night.;2006-07-02 02:30:00;2-5 min.;((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  Possible hoax.  PD)) A triangular craft with solid red and flashing white lights hovering strangely over Virginia Beach, VA late at night. I was watching TV late at night around 2:30 am. I looked around the window and show flashing white lights. I went up to the window and noticed some aircraft flying. My first thought was a helicopter because it was moving very weirdly. It went left and up and right and up and zig zagged a few times and it moved pretty fast. I pressed my ear tot he window but i didn't hear any sounds of a helicopter instead it was just silent. I focused hard and noticed with was triangular shaped and it had a red light on each angle. there were white lights flashing but in an irregular patern. I moved away from the window and a couple of minutes later notices white lights flashing right above my house. they stopped and a couple of minutes later they flashed again. This was not the first time I've seen this. A couple of days before for a cuple of seconds i saw some red and white lights moving in a zig zag patern out the window, again at night. But they quickly disappeared behind other houses and trees. Again, completely silent.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
Triangular craft, solid white lights with red center over Oceana Air Force Base Virginia Beach, VA;2008-10-20 20:30:00;15 seconds;Triangular craft, solid white lights with red center over Oceana Air Force Base Virginia Beach, VA As my wife and I sat on the couch with our window blinds open, I suddenly heard my wife say 'Whats that!?' Sitting next to her, I said 'See what?' And within seconds a very large triangular shaped craft appeared within my visual through the window pane in the sky. Now we are used to jets flying at night from Oceana Air Force Base in Virginia Beach, VA, but this was no jet! The craft was very close to us, maybe 1/4 to 1/2 mile and very large in comparision to jets at that range. It was probably 1000 feet in the air, flying behind the tree lines. I watched in disbelief and quickly ran out the front door to get a better view of the lights, but the craft was lower than our next door neighbors house. I could hear engines or some sort of mechanical power grrr through the sky. I ran out back but couldn't see anything else, only the sound fading away. We quickly jumped in the car to take a ride to see if we could get another glimpse of it, but we had no luck. To describe the craft: It looked exactly like a triangle starting with 5 vertical lights, then 4, then 3, then 2, then 1. They were VERY bright lights, not typical commercial flight lights. A strange thing about the lights was, the 3 vertical lights had a red light in the middle. This was the only different light, and it also was very bright red. The lights did not blink, they remained solid. I would love to know what we saw, and have looked for it from time to time ever since.

@ the intersection of Priness Anne Road & Upton Drive, near Red Mill Commons...;2010-08-12 23:35:00;5-7 minutes;@ the intersection of Priness Anne Road & Upton Drive, near Red Mill Commons... A buddy and I were heading home from grabbing a bite to eat when we stopped at a traffic light and saw three lights moving in one direction. My friend asked if I noticed that the far left light was behaving oddly it wasn’t flashing, but it would seemingly disappear from view at random intervals. I thought it looked like a plane, at first, but the light positions and behavior didn’t correspond with those of typical navigation lights.  Right before the light turned green, the object seemed to stop.  I was close enough to the ground to use terrestrial objects as a reference for its position.  We then began travelling towards the object on a two lane highway, leading out to the rural part of town (I gather from the way it approached that this was where it was originally, before moving towards us).  The closer we got to it, the more we realized that it had stopped moving and was hovering over a field. It was frozen in place.  The radio was at a very minimal volume and we both had our windows down.  We were more than close enough to hear a jet turbine, prop chatter, etc. At our closest point I would imagine it was roughly 125 yards out in the field. The craft was triangular in shape, but somewhat thin from a side view.  It had three lights, one on each corner of the triangle shape, and a spotlight on the front (or in the direction was moving, rather), which was casting a fading cone shape, straight ahead.  For a brief period, I also noticed a faint blue light emanating from underneath the vessel. We pulled over in a turning lane just beyond our point of perp endicularity.  As we stopped, the car behind us pulled over in the same turning lane, just ahead of us. My friend got out of the car to catch a better look, but my view was perfect from inside the car.  Shortly after stopping, the craft began floating across the road we were travelling, not quite a quarter mile behind us.  It was directly above the street I would wager it was about 150-200 feet above the ground.  It was travelling very slow and was heading behind the shopping center we had just left. We pulled up next to the other car and asked the driver if he saw what j! ust happened. He said he just got off the phone with his girlfriend, telling her about the hovering object.  He claimed he was a seasoned pilot and began commenting on the object's triangular shape and strange hovering.  He explained how the particular craft looked and behaved unlike anything he had ever seen. Side note:  This is a tough position to be in.  I used to mock those that reported UFOs, but now, I am one of them.  My friend and I, plus the other man in the car behind us, saw something that was simply unfathomable.  This was no faded smudge from a distance or a lightning fast stream of light this was up close and personal.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
Triangle with white/yelllow lights over Towncenter, Virginia Beach.;2011-10-20 20:00:00;3-5 minutes;Triangle with white/yelllow lights over Towncenter, Virginia Beach. My cousin and I were waiting for a friend outside an apartment complex near Town Center Virginia Beach.  I noticed a bright white/yellow light near the Armada Hoffler building.  As I pointed it out to my cousin it started to sway back and fourth.  The light then moved very fast, bouncing across the sky.  It would slow down and the light would get dimmer and sometimes it would go completely out.  When it was out I could still make out an object.    The last time it came back on, three lights came on and we could see it was actually a triangle.  It hovered for a few seconds and then shot off out of site.  We were sitting in a car with the windows down and engine off and were not able to hear it make any noise. My cousin wanted to get it on his camera phone, but I was so frightened I wouldn't let him.  This lasted for about 3 to 5 minutes over an area with hundreds of people.  When the person we were waiting for at the apartment came out, we told him we had just seen a ufo and he said he had seen a triangle hovering near his apartment several nights before. I have lived near Oceana Naval Air Station all my life and have never seen anything like this.  This happened about a year ago I have seen 2 other events similar to this since then, but not as crazy as this first one.;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125
Orange Lights in Triangular Formation over Virginia Beach.;2013-06-08 11:30:00;1 minute;Orange Lights in Triangular Formation over Virginia Beach I just saw an incredibly large triangle over land in Virginia Beach and couldn't believe the size.  There were clouds out tonight so it could not have possibly been stars or a planet.  I can identify a helicopter or airplane from the numerous vehicles I see almost daily in this area.  It was silent and was below the cloud deck, but the size was extremely large.  Giant in fact.  I've never seen something so large and distinct in our sky ever.  I am truly touched, enough to write this note tonight.   Each light was equidistant from each other and faded out quickly.  One light went out and then the other 2 went out at the same time and not a Chinese lantern.  I've seen them before as well.  Hopefully others saw the same thing as me and the people around me weren't the only ones seeing this object.  It was a once in a lifetime event as far as I'm concerned. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS) Dear Peter, I called WAVY news, the local NBC affiliate and reported my sighting.  It was an amazing site. I only wonder if it was a government vehicle of sorts,  Amazing indeed! Thanks for your time this evening. I can't sleep now… ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM));36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125

Dull Diamond Triangle;2017-06-06 00:45:00;2 minutes;Dull Diamond Triangle I was sitting out front smoking my pipe and 3 huge lights appeared, in a triangle shape, in the gray rain cloud night sky.  The lights looked like 3 moons, 2 up top and 1 in the south.   After 30 seconds, 2 of the lights faded that you could still see, the north ones.  And the 3rd light, south corner, got very bright like a dull diamond instead of the bright diamond light they usually look like.  They were a white light like the white light in the movie, 'Arrival'.   After that, they all faded out leaving the gray rain cloud sky.   I had my tablet in my pocket the whole time and didn't even think to record it.  *Sigh*;36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125

Objects darted around as if they were playing tag. I shined my light at several of the objects.  ((anonymous report));2018-02-24 15:00:00;2 hours;Objects darted around as if they were playing tag.  I shined my light at several of the objects and they followed my light again as if they were playing follow the leader i.e. follows my light.  The objects, which were triangle in shape, were surrounded by a field that changed shape.  The objects moved side-to-side, up and down, also hovered, and at times were completely still, NO SOUND WAS HEARD from any of the objects.   1 year ago, I saw a triangle shaped craft up and close as it appeared motionless above a neighbor’s home almost appearing as if it was observing what was going on in the home at that time.  I will write that repot in detail and post it soon.  Let me just say the object I saw up and close WAS some type of triangular craft, it could for a lack of a better word camouflage itself, blending into the sky as if it was a small cluster of stars.  It was very quick and stealth. It made no sound or had no exhaust or heat signature!!   These crafts fly above t! he VA beach sky’s day and night.  There are bright triangular crafts that the military use and hide in plain sight, they appear to be stars but are some type of craft that have extremely bright lights, I have seen them up close, and personal too, I believe they are some type of very Advanced MILITARY DRONE.  Not much bigger than a vw bug but quick fast stealthy, they can move around.  Just look in to the night sky for a triangular shape that appears to move just a bit.  They are there every night and day. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));36.8211467980295;-76.0892914614125

It also flew seemingly faster than any plane. It was definitely something we’ve never seen before.
