While out a light came across the horizon.  It caught my attention since it was brighter than an airplane.  I actually glanced up at it then did a double take when I realized it wasn't a plane.  It wasn't high enough to have been planes in formation.  It was 4 round lights in a diamond pattern.  It was completely silent, no contrail.  It passed from North to South.  We have a NASCAR event here this week.  I considered it being a blimp coming to cover the race but they're normally very loud.;36.61642;-82.1860640000001
