A flash of light with a flying saucer suddenly appeared it swayed back and forth for about five minutes. The car suddenly shut off and i drifted to the side of the road. I paniced because it started approaching me. My brother ((deleted)) was with me and can verify this strange occurance.  My number is 466-((deleted)).;36.61642;-82.1860640000001
Large donut-shaped craft with lights, used so much force when moving that it moved trees out of the way.;2011-07-30 23:30:00;5 minutes;Large donut-shaped craft with lights, used so much force when moving that it moved trees out of the way. 11:30 PM, a white donut-shaped craft about 100 ft in diameter with red, blue, and green lights on the sides, and a single green light on the top and bottom, floated and rotated overhead. Sounded like a helicopter but muffled, so a bit like a large drone. It was extremely loud as I covered my ears it floated slowly past and once it was about 150 ft away, it turned on its side in the air and shot away so quickly that the trees on the fence line it was flying above bent out of its way. My aunt was driving home at the time I saw it and when I got into her car (the reason I was waiting outside to begin with) she began excitedly talking about the UFO she had just seen, unprompted by me. She described it word for word how I saw it, but I donâ€™t think she believed me when I told her I saw it first.;36.61642;-82.1860640000001
