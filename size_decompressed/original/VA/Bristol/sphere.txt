Dark Shadowy orbs floating over Bristol, Va.;2016-11-12 14:00:00;30 seconds;Dark Shadowy orbs floating over Bristol Va My girlfriend & I witnessed 4-6 dark grey to black spheres hovering in the sky in broad daylight.  We thought it was puffs of smoke, but while watching, we realized they were spinning and would grow a little and then shrink again.  All of them combined into one and suddenly vanished.  We drove towards the direction they were in but could not find them. Never seen anything like it.;36.61642;-82.1860640000001
