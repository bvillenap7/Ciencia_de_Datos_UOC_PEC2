I walked outside to my truck after picking our children up from a day with their grand parents and noticed a very bright light in the sky.  Lower altitude, approx 5k to 7.5k. By 3.5 miles in the distance. Gold in color with a slight orange.  The action that made this stand out the most was the fact that the object was perfectly stationary.  There was no wavering or change in altitude.  Working as a firefighter I have been around helicopters on multiple occasions with emergency situations.   There was also no sound or flashing taillight.  This lasted for rightly 15 and the light was gone.  It seemed to just disappear.;36.61642;-82.1860640000001

I saw this thing on 11-10-13 while driving south on US highway 19.  It was in the north western sky.  It appeared to be an usually bright star.  I observed it for about 30 minutes. I really did not think much of it other than it was unusual.  The next night,11-11-13 at 6:15 PM I was in Bristol TN.  Near the Painter Creek Marina on south Holston lake.  I was with a friend outside looked up and saw it again!  I ask my friend what he thought it was.  He was in the process of telling me it was a satellite when it suddenly move toward us very quickly, then went away slightly and stopped.  It hovered for about a minute, then flew off very quickly!  While it hovered it made no sound, it looked like a very bright light about the size of a large plane, with a very bright light on top of it.  When it flew away it sounded like a jet plane.  I don't know what it was, maybe a drone?;36.61642;-82.1860640000001
All of a sudden, a bright light filled the sky, and my whole inside of the house.  ((anonymous report));2017-09-11 20:38:00;Thru the night until 400a;I was told to contact you guys for help.  Let me start by saying this is very real.  I've never believed in this stuff before.  It happened. Last night the most incredible thing happened to my family and I.  First time was around 830pm, I believe.  I was playing my playstation and the wife was in bed, when all of a sudden a bright light filled the sky and my whole inside of the house.  It lasted 1 second.  Then it was immediately followed the strangest sound that I've ever hear in my life (I'm military and have heard a lot of things).  It was horribly loud and sound like a grinding metal mixed with a deep scream!  It shook the house and the neighborhood. My wife jumped out of bed and couldn't believe It!  It immediately was followed by a white blinding light and that sound again.  I went outside to see if it was a transformer but there was no storm and nothing was wrong.  My neighbors asked what happened and then went inside.   I came back in and tried to forget but it happened again at 200am!  This with a pattern of 3 times!  It woke my wife up again!  And my kids this time.  I looked outside and still nothing. 400am was it happened again with a pattern of 3 times!  The vibration of it made me feel sick!  I didn't sleep at all trying to figure this out.  I just couldn't.   My power company didn't have any idea nor did anybody else!  I never lost power!      I posted what had happened on facebook and have gotten people messaging me saying they heard or saw it too!  I had one lady say her lights flickered off and on in her car as she drove by the neighborhood.  Odd???  The part that gets me the most is the lights and sounds had an order to them.  It wasn't a coincidence or damage with something electric.  It had a pattern.  If you can help me out here I would appreciate it!   I've never been big on this kind of stuff but I just can't deny what just happened to us.      Should I worry?  Are we in some kind of trouble or was it a one time thing?  Nothing has happened since the other night! ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witness via telephone, and he sounded to us to be serious-minded.  PD));36.61642;-82.1860640000001
