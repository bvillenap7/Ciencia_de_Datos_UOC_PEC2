Blinking red, blue, green light 251 degree West.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probable sighting of Sirius, we suspect.  PD));2014-04-20 21:41:00;undetermined;Blinking red, blue, green light 251 degree West Sighting April 20, 2014.  9:41pm.  251 degree West  	 On this night I was out looking at Orion's Belt, or what I think it was.  There were only say 3 stars in a row on the horizon of the night sky in Lovettsville, VA.  I looked to the left of Orion's Belt, I saw a blinking red, blue, green light in the sky to the west around 250 to 275 degree.   The object was clearly moving like a bee to a flower.  That is how it was moving I went ahead and recorded it on my phone.  The video was held steady and the object was still moving.   I know it was part of the night sky cause I looked out about an hour later and it had stayed in the same place but moved with the night sky.   I am just curious to know what it was on that night that I saw.   Can anyone offer anything realistic of a solution? ((NUFORC Note:  Probable sighting of Sirius, we suspect.
