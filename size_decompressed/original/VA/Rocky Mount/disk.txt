We were giong north on a county road toward rt.619 when a large craft caught my attention. It was situated around 1 mile east of my location over or near the county landfill. At first i thought it was a helicopter as i saw it out of the corner of my eye. I emediatly stopped my car and got out and looked directly at it. At this point i could only see part of it. I got back in the car screaming at my partner to wake up and look at this thing. We backed up spinning wheels to see it again. I could tell that it was NOT A HELICOPTER. It was easily bigger than any aircraft that i have ever seen. It had two distinct lines running around the edges with large lights or windows running between the lines. it had a tarnished silver color to it and appeared to glow It made no sound as it moved north behind the trees.The trees didnt move as the craft moved toward them.The air was completely still.You could here traffic coming north on rt.220.After determining that this thing could defenitely here me and knowing that it could see me, i left the county alltogether at a high rate of speed and didnt look back.;36.9858;-79.8828
