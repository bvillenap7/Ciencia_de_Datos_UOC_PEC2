Oval shaped dull gray object traveling at low altitude during daylight;2011-10-22 08:22:00;10 seconds;Oval shaped dull gray object traveling at low altitude during daylight I was driving on Rt 50 towards Boyce, Va from Middleburg, Va. I was between Boyce and Paris when I saw a dull gray colored oval object crossing Rt 50 a few miles ahead of me. It was hard to judge the altitude, but it wasn't very high...toolow for a plane.  I initially thought it might be a balloon of some sort, but it was moving too fast, was too small for a passenger balloon and too big for a small child's balloon.   I had my video camera with me and and initially was going to wait until I cleared a line of trees to get a better shot, but decided to get what I could from the car.  What I was able to catch is very short, but I was fortunate to get it.  It went behind the treeline and when I got past the trees about 30 seconds later, it was gone.;39.0682;-78.022
