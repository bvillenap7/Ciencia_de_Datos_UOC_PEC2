Bright Light traveling parallel to ground descends to the ground in a fireball in South Hill, VA.((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor.  PD));2009-03-29 21:44:00;15 seconds;Bright Light traveling parrellel to ground descends to the ground in a fireball in South Hill, Virginia Traveling East in a car on Franklin Street in South Hill, Virginia at approximately 9:44 PM EST. I was slowing down for a stop sign at the end of the road when I noticed on my left side (north) a very large light traveling parrallel to the ground. I looked up and watched it cut from left to right (north east) and descend rapidly at an angle towards the ground. The light had turned into a fireball at this point with a bright red-orange tail. It descended quickly into the trees and dissappeared. There was no smoke, no sound, and no falling fragments. I then called my husband to tell him and he advised me to call 911. I called 911 and the operator took my report. I took off down a couple of side streets in the direction that I saw the object descend while I was on the phone with the 911 operator but there was no sign of the object.
