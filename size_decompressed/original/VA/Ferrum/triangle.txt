As our group of 3 friends were driving down back roads through Ferrum Virginia immediately after a brief rain storm, Two lights which looked like directed car headlights appeared in the sky to our left. We slowed down and observed as it flew through clouds and descended then reascended. The craft then headed our direction low silent and rather slowly. once it got closer it was approx. 50-70 ft high and moved directly over our vehicle. as it moved closer it appeared as three yellow\orange lights in a black triangle. It followed over us briefly and one friend\witness described 4 lights and pyramid like shape. It then passed over us towards the other direction, picking up speed, still silent, until it was out of view. afterwards lightning strikes were scene in the area for approx. 1 1\2 hours.     We tried to capture video with a small ipod touch, the object had already passed us on its way into the distance when the recording began. The object in the video is extremely small, without reference points of detail of lights or shape. (in other words the video was useless);36.9135;-80.0376
