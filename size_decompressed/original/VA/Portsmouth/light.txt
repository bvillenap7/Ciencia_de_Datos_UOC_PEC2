Strange, Blinking, White Lights-Hovering;2008-11-20 06:00:00;about 20 mins.;Strange, Blinking, White Lights-Hovering Just standing on my porch in historic olde town portsmouth.  A bright blinking/flashing light was seen and witnessed by myself and two others.  It was seen falling out of the sky right above the houses as if it were a parachute jumper or some tye of fallen light.  It was crazy as ever.  I do not really believe in this and take it from me this is not the first sighting of something weird Ive seen here of all places. The flashing, blinking, white light just seemed to fall out of nowhere, straight down and then try to regain its composure, like some sort of flapping or something.  It then just kept flashing and hovering about the buildings and just disappeared.  Believe it or not I know what I saw.

It was at first on my right side as I was coming on the overpass.  As the road straighten out, the craft was in front of me so I got a good look at it.  This was when I observed the speed. By time I had drove about a half mile, the light was gone.;36.8389655913979;-76.3596956989247
Bluish light going around in circles in the sky.;2012-05-20 01:45:00;1 hour;Bluish light going around in circles in the sky. At approximately 1:30am, on May 20th 2012, I happened to look out the window at the sky behind my home.  What I saw is something I will NEVER forget or be able to explain. There, in the clouds, was a bluish light going around in a large slightly irregular circular pattern.  The “light” was rather large and in the clouds not a ground light shining up.  The night was completely overcast, but the clouds where it was were very slowly spiraling also.  Much, much slower than the light itself. It was covering a large area, I would estimate from the ground about a mile and a half radius. There was no noise whatsoever. I got my wife to come and see and we went outside to watch it. We watched for about 45 minutes. She began to get a little “freaked out” so we went in. I continued to keep checking on it for a little bit. It was gone after about 20-30 minutes.  I did not see it stop or exit. We had not been asleep prior to this and I am a smoker who smokes outside in the bac! kyard. This was not a spotlight, as it had not been there 20 minutes prior to my first sighting of it.  I say this because I had gone out to smoke about that length of time prior.  I have looked for it to return EVERY night since. We cannot explain this and have really tried, as I don’t consider myself a “believer.” But this was definitely unidentified and it was flying. As for the object, I think “it” was obscured in the clouds. If this can be explained or have seen similar I would like to know for our piece of mind. I can be contacted if you wish.;36.8389655913979;-76.3596956989247
Bright bluish white circular light ascending and then hovering, than making a quick u-turn or 180, in comet like motion and descending.;2012-06-22 21:00:00;1 minute;Bright bluish white circular light ascending and then hovering, than making a quick u-turn or 180, in comet like motion and descending. Witnesses (College Students at their home) saw a bright bluish white circular light moving upwards into the sky.  The light was too bright and a solid object, almost like the light was the composition of the whole object.  Witnesses watched the craft for a few seconds while it was headed upward and then the object stopped for another couple of seconds.  The object then proceeded to make a very quick u-turn like motion, a complete 180 in the other direction going downward, and moved as fast as a shooting star and was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));36.8389655913979;-76.3596956989247

Group of sparkling objects in the sky.;2020-06-13 17:20:00;10 minutes;Group of sparkling objects in the sky. I was on the dock looking up at the sky and noticed a bunch of sparkling objects approaching. I saw a plane in the distance going the opposite way and realized they were not planes. Looked like a flock of birds but each had one light. Done were green but most were white.  One of them got real close to another one and then moved away at a constant speed. They seemed to be moving slow. There was one that was to the Right if the others  I looked and the group were becoming out of sight. I turned to look at the line one and it was still there moving slowly. I looked back at the grouping and the sparkling lights could no longer be seen. Looked back at the single one and it was gone.;36.8389655913979;-76.3596956989247
