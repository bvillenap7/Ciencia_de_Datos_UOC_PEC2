A trail of smoke;1986-09-19 19:00:00;10 minutes;A trail of smoke We have 3 small windows at the top of our door right before the steps. I was going upstairs one night and I happened to look out of the door window. I was white smoke traveling down the street and I thought someone's house was on fire. I was scared to open the door my mother was sleeping so I just watched. It traveled about the height of a light pole and as I continued to observe it, there was an end to it. It was about 20 feet in lenght and traveled down the street over one of my friend's house. It stopped right over their roof and it did a circle and had gotten smaller. It stood over my friend's house for about 2 minutes and just disappeared. Out of the 2 other ufos' I've seen that was the weirdest. ((NUFORC Note:  One of three reports submitted by witness.  Time and date may be approximate.  PD));36.8389655913979;-76.3596956989247
