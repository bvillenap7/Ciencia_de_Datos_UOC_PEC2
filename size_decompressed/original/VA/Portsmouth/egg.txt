It had a bright spot of light shining of its right side.  This day is the birthday of the internet and i wonder if that is why i saw it.  All i know is fiber optic cables tend to curl to the right and maybe that's why the light on the ufo was on the right side.  Thanks.;36.8389655913979;-76.3596956989247
