circular object headed towards the sky;1984-07-14 22:00:00;5 minutes;circular object headed towards the sky This sighting happened a few years ago but I don't remember the exact month or day of course. This is something I kept to myself. Anyway, I was about 14 years old and there is a play park next to my mother's house. I would always look out of the window and look at the stars before I went to bed. This one particular night I looked out of the window and saw a circular object with a yellowish light going around it. I swear it just took off from somewhere because it was headed toward the sky. I observed it for about 5 minutes and it disappeared right before my eyes. There is an airport not too far from where I lived but I saw this very clearly. It was a clear night with a full moon.

Orange light in northern sky, April 12th, 2015 at 10pm EST in Portsmouth, Virginia.;2015-04-12 22:00:00;90 seconds;Orange light in northern sky, April 12th, 2015, at 10pm EST in Portsmouth Virginia. Glowing orange light moving slowly in northern sky, heading west.  Light was moving slower than any other aircraft visible and appeared much closer, no trail or secondary lights visible.   After observing for about 50 seconds, the light made a sharp 70-75 degree turn, continued north northwest for about 25 seconds, then the orange light flicked out, revealing two side by side bright white lights, stood stationary for about 15 seconds, then completely disappeared.;36.8389655913979;-76.3596956989247
Light reflecting off of circular see-through craft.;2015-04-22 14:00:00;20 seconds;Light reflecting off of circular see-through craft. We were sitting by the water and I looked at the tree line.  The was a bright light.  Thought it was a light reflecting off of an airplane so I told my friend to look.  The light reflected off of a see-through circular object and then it completely disappeared.   It was a perfectly clear day, no clouds.  There was no airplane in the area we saw the light.  The object was hovering above the tree line, circular and fairly large.  We could only see light reflecting, other than that it looked like the sky.   We stayed in the area longer hoping to see it again but we never did.;36.8389655913979;-76.3596956989247
2 orange circles move  across the sky, but together at the same speed not falling.;2017-06-08 21:00:00;45 seconds;2 orange circles move  across the sky, but together at the same speed not falling more like 2 rockets but went all the way across the sky and got smaller and smaller until they disappeared like if they were gone into space.   I have seen rockets that go into space, and they were nothing like it usually when u see a rocket they have a arch like leaving atmosphere these went straight across, then upwards motion;36.8389655913979;-76.3596956989247
