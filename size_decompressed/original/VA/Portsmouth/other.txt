squarelike object with a light;1986-02-22 21:00:00;1 minute;squarelike object with a light One night my mother and I were going to a corner store to get a few things. I happened to look up into the sky and saw a square(round at the ends) with a light going around it. A building blocked my view but when we passed the building it had disappeared.

2 WEIRD BLUE LIGHTS THAT ARE REALLY FAST. FOLLOWED BY WHITE AND RED FLASHING AIRCRAFT;2019-01-09 18:30:00;1 minute;2 WEIRD BLUE LIGHTS THAT ARE REALLY FAST. FOLLOWED BY WHITE AND RED FLASHING AIRCRAFT Driving at night we saw an unexplainable color blue light,  I guess close to tourquoise and indigo, it was a beautiful color that’s what caught our eye, in the shape of a dot going faster than any aircraft could go, with another blueish dot going just as fast as the first one.  They are both in the sky at the same time and then a flashing white and red light (what you normally see for aircrafts at night) comes out of nowhere and sped up as fast as the blue light and the blue light it connected with turned out and the other blue light when straight down.  Then the flashing white and red light flying aircraft disappeared as if it just turned its lights out.  Just seconds after the lights are gone we hear a rumbling sound that we described as the “UFO” landing.  Minutes later the sky was purplish gray in the area they disappeared;36.8389655913979;-76.3596956989247
