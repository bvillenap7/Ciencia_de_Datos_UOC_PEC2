A large white light in the sky traveling horizontally that appeared to be dropping fireballs;2006-06-25 22:45:00;1-2min;A large white light in the sky traveling horizontally that appeared to be dropping fireballs On Saturday, June 25, 2006, my neighbors and myself saw an light in the sky that looked like a plane from a distance dropping something out (a bright white light dropping a yellowish-orange fireball).  When the lighted object passed over us it dropped one of the lighted balls.  We observed the falling light that looked similar to a falling star and we watched and heard it hit the roof of a suburban about 25 ft away from us.  Then we watched the light continue on and drop another before it just vanished.  The object was flying in a horizontal line and did not appear to be ascending or descending.  We went to see if we could find any fallen matter but there was nothing.  There was not even a dent in the roof of the truck.  The loud thud we heard from the golf ball size light surely would have left some kind of mark. We also checked the following day and there was nothing.;36.8389655913979;-76.3596956989247
Orange-red ball of fire flying through the sky.;2013-05-26 20:00:00;3 minutes;Orange-red ball of fire flying threw the sky. A orange-red ball-like object that was flickering like it was on fire came into view, continuing in a straight line towards North, sometimes stopping for about two seconds, continued again, then stopped completely stopped.  It hovered there for a few seconds, then moved West, then continued to go up until it vanished completely.  This happened four times, all of them doing the same thing.  Also they all changed to a blood red before they start going up.;36.8389655913979;-76.3596956989247
