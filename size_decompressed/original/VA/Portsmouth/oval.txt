There was one craft, it looked like a metallic balloon with a bottom section with a cone shape on the underside. (http://www.ufoevidence.org/Photographs/Photo44.htm is almost exactly what we saw)It moved across the sky a smooth, rapid speed and then just stopped and hovered. At that point we moved behind a building for about 10-15 seconds and by the time we got on the otherside it was no where in site, we had plenty of room to see for miles in many directions and was too low to have gone above the clouds in that short of time. There was an airline jet in the background coming in for a landing at ORF and a bird in closer, so it couldn't have been that high in the air. It was very visible, and distinct...no where near the clouds that were in the sky.;36.8389655913979;-76.3596956989247

((NUFORC Note:  We telephoned the witness, to confirm whether the report is a serious one, and the witness assured us it was intended as a serious account of a real sighting.  He reports that he was looking to the north, and that the object appeared to him to be approximately one half the apparent size of the Sun in the daytime sky.
