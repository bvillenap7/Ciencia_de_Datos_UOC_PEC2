It was a crazy experience.;2010-06-30 09:39:00;15 minutes;It was a crazy experience. I was at a grave yard with my boyfriend.  We were putting flowers on his dads grave and I was just standing around while he fixed the flowers. While I was standing there a green orb fell to the ground.  I asked my boyfriend if he had seen it and he said no that I was just paranoid about being in a graveyard at night.   Well, about 20-30 minutes later I seen something flying in the air that looked EXACTLY like a flying saucer.  There was lights around the craft that lit up a portion of the sky and I just sat there and stared at it for about 5-10 minutes until it disappeared behind the clouds.  Iâ€™ve never seen anything like this and think it was absolutely crazy. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date.
