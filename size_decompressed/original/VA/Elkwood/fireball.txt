Two tailed burning object moving erratically.;2019-10-11 20:05:00;5 minutes;Two tailed burning object moving erratically. We were heading NE on HWY 15 approaching Elkwood, VA.  My friend and I saw a doubled tailed object with bright lights and burning tails behind them.  It looked like what I had seen before from an object entering the atmosphere, but I knew it wasnâ€™t because it had two tails in sun.   Then the object stopped going downward and swirled up and maneuvered down again and then side to side.  We were driving and trees blocked our view for a few seconds but it came back into view over and over.  It did not seem like any object that I know of.  It seemed to get lower and lower going back and forth before disappearing altogether behind trees well off in the distance.  We pulled over and are completely stumped.   We looked on the map and Culpeper Regional Airport is close by but no plane or helicopter or drone or anything I can imagine flies up, down, side to side and has identical in sync burning tails such as this.  Please let us know if you hear any other reports or have informa! tion on what this may be.;38.4663;-77.8203
