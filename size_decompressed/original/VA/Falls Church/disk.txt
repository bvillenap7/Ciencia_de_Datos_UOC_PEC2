Small blue dot traveling swiftly across sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Lens flare??  PD));2016-09-02 12:18:00;Seconds;Small blue dot traveling swiftly across sky. Yesterday, Friday, Sept. 02, a ring appeared around the sun over Falls Church, VA.  My daughter and I stopped the car to take a few pictures.   Today, while deleting some of the photos, I noticed something strange.  In each of three photos there is a blue dot.  This dot moved rapidly in each of the photos. The photos were taken just seconds apart. And suggestions what this might be?  I have some good photos and will attempt to to post them.;38.8782974576272;-77.1812381355932
