circular,bright multicolored lights rotating around middle of object;1975-11-13 21:00:00;5 min;circular,bright multicolored lights rotating around middle of object I was about 12 years old at the time, playing with approx. 4 other kids near a big sewer pipe near our apts.   Someone said look at that and I did,I saw a HUGE circular ship that had different colors revolving around the ship.red, blue, green etc.it made it look sort of like one of those lighted tops, because the colors were changing it looked like the thing was hovering but spinning around and around. We all just stood there looking at this thing until it sorta went below the tree level and we couldnt see it anymore.  It stayed with me all these years, I never told people what we saw, but I always knew it was not of this world.  I dont know if the others ever told,this is the first time I've told about that in all these years. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

At 11:15pm on April 17, 2009, four bright objects were sighted flying at a very high speed, in a strange pattern, over N. Va;2009-04-17 23:15:00;8 seconds;At 11:15pm on April 17, 2009, four bright objects were sighted flying at a very high speed, in a strange pattern, over N. Va After leaving dinner with several friends in Falls Church, Virginia, my husband and I walked out to our car.  It was about 11:15pm on April 17, 2009.  The sky was very clear with no moon, so I looked up to see some stars.  I looked directly overhead, which at that time and season was toward the area of the sky around the fixed star Arcturus in the constellation Bootes. When I looked at the sky, I saw four luminous, round objects moving in a northeastern direction.  The objects were uniform in size their brightness was similar to an average star.  They were clearly flying at a very high altitude.  Thinking at first glance that they were a group of meteorites, I pointed them out to my husband.   It became apparent that they were not meteorites since their shape, speed and luminosity was constant.  They flew almost directly overhead at a high speed and altitude, and did not appear to be birds. As the objects continued to fly toward the northeast, their formation changed.  Rather than flying at a constant direction and speed, they began a movement pattern that was similar to a small swarm of insects.  They maneuvered around each other, almost playfully, staying in one group. The objects seemed to move in a more northerly direction as they assumed this new flight pattern and then flew to the north toward Washington, DC and out of sight.;38.8782974576272;-77.1812381355932
Two shimmering disk like objects over Falls Church, VA.  ((anonymous report));2017-06-17 14:00:00;3 minutes;Two shimmering disk like objects over Falls Church, VA. While running laps at Falls Church high school football field, I was on the ground stretching and doing sit ups and lookiing up at the sky, when I saw a shimmering disk like object moving at a slow rate south to north in a wobbling type manner, clouds around 20,000 ft. The object would pass above and behind the clouds at moments then reappear.  After approximately a minute and a half, and as this first object was now further north of Fall Church, towards Bethesda, MD., a seconds object, just like the first appeared above me and was in follow to the first object.  As the objects wobbled, it appeared they were shiny on top, darker on the bottom, but it was a strange dark shade, I couldn't really make out a specific color.  There was no sound I could associate with it, no vapor trails. The following object disappeared within a minute and a half some where north of Falls Church, VA.  End of statement.
