Somewhere between 8:00 and 10:00pm I got up out of my seat and told my girlfriend the UFO is here(completely random, makes me wonder because 2 days before I felt the UPS man about to ring my doorbell, 30 seconds later my doorbell is ringing!)  We went out on my porch, and sure enough we saw a huge object near the moon.  The egg shaped craft seemed to blink colors, possibly green red yellow maybe some orange?  I took binoculars out of the house looked at the object again, and it was just too eerie, it seemed to have some black lines wrapped around the object.  Stars were visible that night, but this object just seemed impossible to be a star.  Clouds came in and blocked my view of the objects.  Everyday after that night I've looked outside and have seen nothing like this object again.;38.8782974576272;-77.1812381355932
