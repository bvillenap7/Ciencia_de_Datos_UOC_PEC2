At approximately 2:10am, Wednesday, March 14,2001, I observed 2 incredibly fast light sources moving North to South. They were at an altitude of less than 1000ft. and were both dimly lit with at least 15 white lights each. I could not distinguish either objects form due to their incredibly fast speed. Generally they mirrored one anothers movements but clearly the craft on the East side was jumping to the East as much as 100ft. and changing its altitude 100ft. simultaneously without any overt sign of acceleration yet jumped back to mirror the general flight path of the craft to its immediate West. Both crafts appeared to move effortlessly and the only sound I could distinguish was a slight whishing noise when they were almost directly overhead.

Falls Church, Va:  light in the night sky near Orion moves east, turns 90 degrees, and begins moving north.;2012-01-30 22:30:00;Still ongoing;Falls Church, Va:  light in the night sky near Orion moves east, turns 90 degrees, and begins moving north. I took my puppy and cat out back to exercise the puppy a little more before I put her down for the night.  Living near DC, we have a lot of light pollution, so I was pleasantly surprised to see so many stars tonight.  Orion is the most visible constellation and, as I stood looking at him, I saw what I thought was a plane moving east, away from Bellatrix, Orion's left shoulder. My stomach dropped as the object made a sharp ninety degree turn and began moving north.  It moved slowly and stopped a couple of times, appearing to waver slightly, as if it were moving back and forth.  Occasionally it blinked. I have never seen anything like this before and I am still in a state of stunned disbelief.  It might still be visible, but as I thought of coming inside to get a camera, I started getting scared.  Partly because I felt frozen in place.  I had the absurd thought, What if they can see me.;38.8782974576272;-77.1812381355932
