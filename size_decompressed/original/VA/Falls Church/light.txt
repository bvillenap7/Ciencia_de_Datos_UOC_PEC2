Object chased by military jets;2011-04-14 03:08:00;<15 seconds;Object chased by military jets Late last night (on or about 3:08 a.m., 04/14/11) I stepped outside for a smoke.  All of a sudden I heard an increasing in volume thunderous roar, approaching from the north-west.  This made me look up. It sounded like military jet with the pilots really pushing the pedal to the metal.  I did not see the jets, but it sounded like the ones I saw flying over Andrews Airforce base in Maryland.  Commercial jets do not sound anything like that and fly much higher.  (I see a lot of them, since I live about 15 minutes away from Dulles International Airport).  These jets seemed to be flying pretty low and I have never seen or heard them flying over at this time of night - never.  I looked up to see what is making all that noise, but did not see the jets. However, panning the skies from west to south, I saw what looked like a very bright large star, crossing the sky from west to south in the south-western quadrant of the sky. It had the same bluish-white tint to it that the stars do. The line of sight was at about 30 degrees angle to the ground. I could not judge the distance and did not see any shape that might have been associated with the object, but it crossed the sky in under 10 seconds and disappeared behind the trees I have to the south of my house. The strangest thing about the object was that it was blinking in a very peculiar manner. Commercial jets have red and green light, blinking continuously without interruption. This thing was bluish-white, would blink 3 times within approximately 1 second, then would stop blinking all together for a second, then blink 3 times within approximately 1 second again, then stop blinking for a second, etc., during the whole 10 seconds or so it took it to cross the visible to me sout! h west quadrant of the sky. These was no noise at all coming from the UFO directing - the roar I heard was rapidly approaching from the north - west. As I said before, the UFO disappeared behind the trees in about 10 seconds, but I kept hearing the roar for another 5 minutes or so. Sounded like the jets kept flying around. Then everything went silent. Half an hour later the roar came back, but I was already in bed and did not run outside to see what was going on. It would not do any good anyhow, since the speed with which the object moves - it would have been gone by the time I got out. After I got up and came to work, had to tell someone what I saw. I told the story to a security guard that I am friendly with and he said that he lives right near Andrews Airforce Base and he heard they scrambled jets several times last night, which, according to him, they never do at night. He thought someone might have flown into Washington DC no-fly zone or something. This confirms my suspicions that the roar I heard was military jets. The object could not have been a satellite. I have seen those and they do not blink, do not fly at 30 degrees angle above the horizon and do not get chased by the military jets because the jets cannot fly that high. Subsequently I found out that there were two other reports filed by people from the same area filed with the MUFON CMS pretty much describing the same thing I saw.;38.8782974576272;-77.1812381355932
Two reddish-orange lights moving south to north, one after the other within 5 min., near Falls Church, VA;2011-08-20 22:00:00;5 min.;Two reddish-orange lights moving south to north, one after the other within 5 min., near Falls Church, VA At about 22:00 on Aug. 20, 2011, I was in my front yard in Fairfax County, VA, just south of the City of Falls Church.  In the sky to the southeast, at an elevation of about 45 degrees, I saw a single reddish-orange point of light moving at a constant speed from south to north, eventually fading out and disappearing.  A few minutes later, I saw a second, identical light do exactly the same thing.  I was able to look at the second light through binoculars, but couldn’t make out any detail.  There was no sound associated with the lights. I’d say their speed was roughly the same as that of commercial jets.   In fact, I often see airplanes (from Reagan National Airport, I assume) with the same point of origin, elevation and speed as these lights, but they’re always readily identifiable by their bright white landing lights, red and green wingtip lights, and their sound.   We have a lot of air traffic in the area, and I’m quite familiar with the appearance of various types of aircraft at night.  These lights got my attention because they didn’t match anything I’d seen before, and because I didn’t hear any sound. There was no wind and the sky was overcast, with the temperature around 76F.;38.8782974576272;-77.1812381355932
Flickering light with the size of ping pong ball flew with constant speed over falls church virginia;2013-01-20 21:25:00;3 minutes;Flickering light with the size of ping pong ball flew with constant speed over falls church virginia Witnessed a flickering light orange/blue color flew in straight line over our neighborhood at 9:25 pm.  Went outside in the front yard to turn off our Christmas light and witness a strange orange/blue light that was moving in the sky about 200 feet above the ground.  It moved silently with no sound what so ever toward southeast direction and was flickering like a candle light as it was moving along with a constant speed about 30-35 mph.  It had no trail at all.  At one point, it stopped for about 5 seconds above my neighbor rooftop then took off again in the same direction.  I let me son know then ran to the back of the house and watch it from the deck.  It flew away toward southeast direction and elevated as it was moving along, the light get dimmer and dimmer then disappeared as it move further away from us.  I have never seen anything like that before. It made me wonder… from that night…;38.8782974576272;-77.1812381355932

As we drove it looked like it was following us.  We took a video and all that showed was a bright green light moving which we had not seen with our naked eyes. when we were about to head in and then the pattern changed.
