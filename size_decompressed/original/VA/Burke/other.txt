I was outside,camcorder in hand filming the formentioned. After 5 minutes of taping I saw what I thought was a passenger jet, flying thru a chem trail. I rolled tape on it,for about 30 sec.It first looked like the sun reflecting off the wings of a jet. When I reviewed what I taped,I was astonded to see 4 or 5 rotating spheres traveling in a straight line withen the chem trail.;38.7913;-77.2806
