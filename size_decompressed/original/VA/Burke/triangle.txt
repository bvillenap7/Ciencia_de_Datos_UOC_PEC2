a V shaped object with 4 large, bright lights hovering slowly over a neiborhood, then dissapeared;2004-08-12 22:50:00;10 seconds;a V shaped object with 4 large, bright lights hovering slowly over a neiborhood, then dissapeared we were driving in my my friends jeep when we saw 4 large, bright lights in a V shape hovering over a neiborhood or possibly moving slowly.  it was difficult to make out how big it was or how high it was because of the heavy clouds and mild fog.  its 4 lights beamed downwards through the fog.  possibly within 100 yards of the ground. it didnt make much noise, or if it did it could not be heard over the car engine.  we did a U-turn and looked for it again, but it was nowhere to be seen, not even off in the horizon.  this was about 20 seconds after the sighting.  the v-shaped craft appeared to be moving backwards as opposed to how a conventional airplane would fly.  we did not see which direction it went.;38.7913;-77.2806
Large, flat triangular craft with red lights right above the tree line.;2011-12-01 22:30:00;1 min;Large, flat triangular craft with red lights right above the tree line. I was driving home and witnessed a triangular shape moving very slowly right above the trees.  It was very large, about the width of a house, and flat.  I could only see the darkness of it but could tell it blacked out the sky behind it.  It was very low, emitted no sound, but had 3 red lights on the triangle corners.  It disappeared behind the tree lines. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));38.7913;-77.2806
Three very faint lights in a small triangular shape moving very fast across the sky;2012-11-17 01:00:00;3-5 seconds;Three very faint lights in a small triangular shape moving very fast across the sky I had been outside observing the Leonid meteor shower for over 30 minutes (though I had yet to see a meteor), so my eyes were adjusted to the low light conditions, and I was laying on my back looking up.  I saw movement in an area of the sky and focused on it.  I was able to identify three very faint lights in a triangular shape moving very fast across the sky.  I saw the object cover approximately 30-40 degrees of arc in 3-5 seconds before it went out of my view (blocked by roof).  The distance between the lights seemed roughly equidistant and appropriate for an airplane flying at several thousand feet, but the speed at which it moved was not normal.  I did not hear any sound accompanying the object during or after visual contact. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));38.7913;-77.2806
