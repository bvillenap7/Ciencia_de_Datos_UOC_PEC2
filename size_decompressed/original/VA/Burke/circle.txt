Silent, non-blinking red orbs in sky.;2014-07-04 21:00:00;10 minutes;Silent, non-blinking red orbs in sky. We were on our back deck night of July 4, 2014, when I noticed a strange round red light in the sky.  It made no noise and did not blink like helicopters or airplanes.  It was a constant light moving at a casual pace across the night sky.  Time was about 9:10 or 9:15 PM.   There were 2 other people with me and I pointed it out to them.  It was moving from North to South.   Then 2 more of these orbs appeared.  Several more after that ... they were following each other.   And then 3 or 4 more appeared.  I believe I saw a total of 8 to 10 of them.;38.7913;-77.2806
