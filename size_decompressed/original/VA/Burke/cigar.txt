Low, fast moving descending jet-like object without sound and nose tilted up.;2014-11-29 11:00:00;3-5 seconds;Low, fast moving descending jet-like object without sound and nose tilted up. On Saturday, November 29, 2014, at approximately 11AM (est), while driving NW on Lee Chapel Rd in Burke, VA, I saw what looked like a Learjet flying ahead of me appearing from the right at a very fast speed heading to my left.  With tall trees on both sides of the street along my pathway, I had a clear view for about 3 to 5 seconds. What made this unusual were a couple of things:  1)	  The object was flying very low and going down in what I would describe as about 10,000 feet when first coming into view from the right and at about 7,500 feet when going out of view to my left. 2)	  The nose of the object was at about a 170 degree angle up and the tail equally down as it went by, descending. 3)  	I immediately rolled down my window and did not hear a thing.  I drove slowly half expecting to hear an explosion but heard nothing. As I continued on the road I looked at other drivers to see if anyone else was acting like they saw what I saw.  I started to wonder if perhaps it may have been a radio controlled kit, but the field of vision would have made the object out of visible range from any natural place to fly one (residential area, crossing fairly busy road). I turned on my radio to the local all news station expecting another 9-11 or plane crash ‘happening now’ breaking story but heard nothing. I Googled when I got home to see if anyone else posted about it but found nothing. After thinking about it some more an hour or so later, I decided it was way to obvious that I saw something out of the ordinary and decided to check online for where to report it.  This lead me to the National UFO Reporting website. I am also sending an illustration I am putting together to clearly visualize what I saw.;38.7913;-77.2806
