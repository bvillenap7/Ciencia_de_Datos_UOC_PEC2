3 low-flying orange glowing objects over Highway 29 in Chatham, VA;2015-05-24 22:25:00;3 minutes;3 low-flying orange glowing objects over Highway 29 in Chatham, VA My husband and I were driving 29 North through Tightsqueeze/Chatham, VA, and saw to our left, 3 red-orange low-flying glowing objects in a horizontal line (looked like radio towers).   Then they started to move around, and one crossed paths with another one, glided over to the opposite side of Highway 29, then changed directions and went back to the other side.  The objects appeared to speed up and slow down and moved in ways that normal aircraft does not operate.   We were about to crash the car trying to hurry up and do a u-turn to pull over and look at it!  Another car had pulled over to look too!  When we stopped to look at them, there was then only 1 object and it quickly headed away into the distance and the glow dimmed out. The glow appeared to be pulsating slightly.  It had no blinking/flashing lights on it like a plane or helicopter would have.  There's no way it could've been drones.  We have a drone.  This isn't a drone. We are both 37 year old college graduates. My husband is a former combat engineer in the army and currently a Lieutenant in a police department. He has been a police officer for 15 years and has seen many things in the military and in police work but had never seen anything like these objects and he is even throwing around the word “UFO” to describe it.;36.8287;-79.4324
