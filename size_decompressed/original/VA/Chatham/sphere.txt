A silver, perfectly shaped, sphere was spotted.;2001-02-11 22:00:00;2 minutes;A silver, perfectly shaped, sphere was spotted. We were walking outside of the building and sat down on the grass to look up at the stars.  We saw a little thing in the sky moving, and someone thought it was a shooting star, but upon further inspection, we saw that it was a silver, sphere-shaped object, that had a haze around it.  It was also changinbg colors!  Yes, it was changing different colors, right in front of our eyes!  It wasn't moving too fast, however, it was moving fast enough, so that we only saw it in the sky for 2 minutes.  It seemed like there was no opening, as though it were just a full, perfect sphere.  That's all we saw of it, but we're sure it was a UFO.;36.8287;-79.4324
