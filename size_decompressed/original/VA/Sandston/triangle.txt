Bright, Silent & Hovering;2008-03-13 05:30:00;1 hour;Bright, Silent & Hovering My brother in law)called my husband at 5:30 am. He saw something large, silent and triangular just above the treeline. This was at the I-295 and I-64 interchange East of Richmond. My husband woke me up to see what was there in the sky. It was very bright, too bright to be a typical star. My husband left for work around 6am towards Williamsburg. He followed the thing for a ways & able to keep up with it. So, not a plane. I was talking to him on the phone and he was telling me what was going on. He then mentioned he saw a fighter jet or something chase it away.  Closest AFB is Langley in Virginia Beach. Growing up around planes and also living in close proximity to the airport I know what an airplane looks like. This wasn't a typical commercial jet.;37.5157;-77.2758
