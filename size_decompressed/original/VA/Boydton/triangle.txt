Orange orbs forming triangle seen in southern VA.;2014-05-23 22:30:00;30 seconds;Orange orbs forming triangle seen in southern VA. Three orange orbs, linked together to form a triangle, flew overhead from approximately NW to SE very fast!  There was no sound and the object traveled in a relatively straight path without stopping.  It flew at several times the speed of normal aircraft.  We are camping at North Bend Park, an Army Corps of Engineers park located on a large lake at the border of VA and NC.  Other normal aircraft could be seen in the sky at higher elevations throughout the sky, but this object was nothing like a plain.  It also did not have any flashing lights as you expect to see on a plane.;36.6534000000005;-78.375
