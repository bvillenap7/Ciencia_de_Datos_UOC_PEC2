Approximately fifty aircraft in formation, flowing towards DC at 5:45 am  ((NUFORC Note:  Starlink satellites?  PD));2019-11-25 05:45:00;10 minutes;Approximately fifty aircraft in formation, flowing towards DC at 5:45 am November 25, 2019. A line of approximately 50 maybe more, in formation for almost 10 minutes.  Looked as though they were satellite sized but too many for this to be the case and flying in formation at high speed in the distance.  There were three times in the line that there were two side by side and then once with three side by side.  Moving in direction towards Washington, DC.  Iâ€™m thinking maybe a military exercise but that was a very large amount of aircraft.;39.0819;-78.1873
