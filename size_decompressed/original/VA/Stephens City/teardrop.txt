I was not going to document anything until I seen what I had seen tonight. (I had also written a log for 12/06/2008 in Front Royal.)   My husband and I were sitting in the living room watching Comcast on Demand, and from the bay window, another fire ball like object, like the one I had seen before, streaked across the sky and downward as though it were falling.  This Object was much closer then the last fireball like object I had seen, only it was not green.  It was a bright white with a tint of yellow.  It's tail was also longer.  It only remained in my view for about 5 seconds or so, not long at all.  Unfortunately my husband did not see it, and also he stopped me from contacting the local police to see if anyone else reported it.;39.0819;-78.1873
