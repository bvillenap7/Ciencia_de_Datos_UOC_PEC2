I was out for my evening run and was able to pause to listen for background noise (engine, sonic boom, or chase plane). No sounds or were any other objects noted within 5 minutes of the original sighting. Passenger aircraft did enter field of vision 4 minutes after sighting emerging from southwest and (slowly) turning North in an approach pattern for local airport. ((personal data deleted)) ((NUFORC Note--Many meteors from the Geminid Meteor Shower were reported on this date.  That may explain this sighting.));37.2794137055839;-79.9623659898475
