Short 3 foot alien seen near creek in Roanoke, VA.;2013-08-02 01:00:00;2 minutes;Short 3 foot alien seen near creek in Roanoke, VA. I was driving home from my parents house.  It was about 1 am.  They live on top of a large mountain called Bent Mountain.   I was driving down the mountain to the city of Roanoke.  I had my high beams on because the deer are heavily populated in that area.  I saw a rustle in the bushes near the creek so I stopped the car.  A family of deer is what I was expecting to see.  Instead I saw a 3 foot alien to the right of my car.  It was very short had an almond head and long tentacle like legs.  About four to six legs.  It was milky in appearance and shiny in the moonlight.   It stepped out from the bushes and into my view.  I was scared and started to drive without looking back.  It had dark black holes looking like eyes.  But, its eyes seemed like an intelligence was behind it and it might have been lost.  My dogs were in the car at the time and were barking and growling at the entity. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Silent aircraft or crafts flying in a very low formation leaving airport.;2017-01-09 19:30:00;3-5 minutes;Silent aircraft or crafts flying in a very low formation leaving airport. I was driving my girlfriend back to her house that is somewhat close to the Roanoke airport.  We first noticed the aircraft's after turning off Dent Road and they appeared to be leaving the airport.  At this point, they seemed to be right above us.  This was strange because it is usually the direction that aircraft come into land.   It was already dark but there was a particularly bright moon and yet I couldn't make out the shape or size of the aircraft's what so ever.  They were flying very, very low at this point and when I stuck my head out of my car window I couldn't hear any noises coming from them.  There were 4 flashing red lights and 4 solid soft white lights.  I couldn't determine if it was one per aircraft or not due to the strange movement.   When the lights were above us they appeared vertically but as they moved in front of us they/it rotated to a more horizontal position.  The back lights mimicked the front ones but with a slight delay.  I was sure they were helicopters but could hear no sounds from them and I have never witnessed military helicopters that fly over our area to fly in such a close square-like formation.   They left south-east of where we were which is the usual path or military aircraft but they continued to fly oddly low for the rest of the time we could see them.  I am unsure of who to contact to find out if there were military helicopters at the airport during that time or not.   My group of friends have been keeping a closer eye on the skies and have noticed a rise in the number of strange objects in our area.   If there is any information on how to find out if there were copters at the airport I would love to know.;37.2794137055839;-79.9623659898475
