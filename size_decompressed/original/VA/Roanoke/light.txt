Yellow Orb following vehicle , bright yellow lights entering vehicle.;1990-11-20 22:00:00;1 minute;Yellow Orb following vehicle , bright yellow lights entering vehicle. My Friend and I were traving home on the Blue Ridge Parkway after a day of deer hunting it was around 11:30 P.M.   We were nearing Roanoke when my friend asked me to look in the mirror at the crazy guy on the motor cycle following us . The single dull yellow light was gaining on us and and my friend was increasing speed keep away from the speeding vehicle.  We lost sight of the light as we rounded a small curve in the road .  After we realized the light was not following us we decided the vehicle must have lost control in the curve and that we should go back and help if we could.  We turned around and returned to the last location of the light.  As we slowed and searched both sides of the road, a intense yellow light entered our vehicle causing my friend to drive into the drainage ditch on the side of the road.  Observers 1. UPS Driver 2.

ROANOKE LIGHT BALL OR CRAFT -  DECEMBER 2003;2003-12-12 18:00:00;Hour and Half;ROANOKE LIGHT BALL OR CRAFT -  DECEMBER 2003 I was driving south on Route 460 coming from Lynchburg VA and looked at the sky when I saw a brilliant ball of light. First I thought that is was an aeroplane, but when it did not move for minutes at a time, I decided it must be a star. At the moment, the dusk was starting to fall and the other stars were not outit is not uncommon to see the north star at dusk. One thing was, the light was getting brighter with a brilliant white glow. I called my father to let him know about it in Roanoke he confirmed what I was seeing. When I arrived at my house in Roanoke, I pulled out the binoculars and telescope. With the binoculars I could see a round light with a spiderweb like texture (i.e. Binoculars may cause distortion from the distance and brightness). I noticed that there was an unusual amount of aeroplane activity in the sky and around the object. I pulled out the telescope and positioned it to the ball of light. Each time I went to look through the telescope the light moved downward like it was landing. I pulled up my telescope from the back yard to the front to gain a better view and by the time I made it to the front yard, which took about 30 seconds, the light was gone.  I had my scanner on and heard usual police activity in the area, but some messages confused me that come over the air Some of which were morse code, and someone said Turn down the lights and the talking so we dont spook the horses, that meaning I have no idea.  I drove to the Roanoke Regional Airport and found no activity of Military presense, and I called the security office at the airport, which they acted as if they did not know what was going on.  Roanoke has been a hotbed of activity in the last several months with military presense, mostly the Army and Air Force doing practice runs and drills here. There have been a few UFO incidents in the sky with tractor trailer shape aircraft shooting fine mist and floating long distances on that single shot.;37.2794137055839;-79.9623659898475
Brilliant greenish/white object drops from sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor??  PD));2006-10-09 22:00:00;2 seconds;Brilliant greenish/white object drops from sky Turned to the southeast to survey the night sky and witnessed a brilliant white/greenish object fall straight to the horizon.  The object did not appear to arch across the sky as shooting stars or satellites do.  I did not see a tail or trail left by the object.  The object was approximately three times the diameter of the brighest star in the sky.  I did not hear any sounds.  The sky was clear with many stars visible in spite of a bright moon. Object may have been a shooting star but it was very different from others I have seen over the years due to the absence of a tail and the manner in which it appeared to move.  This objec looked as if it dropped straight out of the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor??  PD));37.2794137055839;-79.9623659898475
Moving lights with no sound.;2009-10-03 23:00:00;1 min;Moving lights with no sound. Around 11 pm on Oct 3rd my wife and I were trying to star gaze, but the moon was full. Then I noticed 2 bright lights very high in the eastern sky moving slowly southward. These lights appeared to go dim before they disappeared, after that we seen streaks of light in the area. This is not the first time we have seen odd lights moving through the sky here. Sometimes we have seen moving lights that emits beams of light, flashes of light, multiple lights moving together and lights moving at a high rate of speed making 90 degree turns. I guess what is really weird about all of this is we have had this happen directly over us sometimes and not one time has there been any sound?;37.2794137055839;-79.9623659898475
UFO flap in Roanoke, VA - almost daily;2013-06-05 01:00:00;<1 minute;UFO flap in Roanoke, VA - almost daily At approximately quarter of 1:00 AM, my neighbors and I were talking on our porch enjoying the evening when we all saw a light that was moving from the North sky to the East.  It was approx the brilliance of two planets seen in the night sky together.  It got a bit brighter as it moved, left to right in our vision, and had NO blinking lights.  It moved parallel with the ground, left to right, then (slowly) it dimmed, dimmed, and it was gone. We had previously seen planes in the area and they clearly had blinking lights on. This was just a large massive light, uniform in its shape, roughly that of a light or star. To say it was an orb is too specific. We saw the same thing days before (like 3 or 4 days can't remember) but it was way up in the sky, like where a satellite would be. So I just ignored it as a possible satellite. Yeah,its not a satellite. Also saw a small sprite like light (white -VERY WHITE- and about the size of your hand, f! lies very fast)that appeared right after the encounter. I had seen one of these (5/31/13)but I wasn't sure what I had seen. This time (6/5/13) my neighbor saw it with me, thank goodness. It was like a probe whipping by us or something. And I might as well say it. I think this phenomenon is psychic. I really do. Sorry, I know thats really not what anyone wants to hear but one of these things appeared when I asked it to (5/15/13). Cheers everyone. If you are in Virginia, keep your eyes planted on the Northern Sky.;37.2794137055839;-79.9623659898475
Stationary light above Roanoke City Virigna From dusk to 9-10pm every night.;2013-11-08 17:00:00;4 hours;Stationary light above Roanoke City Virigna From dusk to 9-10pm every night. I was on my way home from work it was still day light outside and we we in Salem heading home.  We stopped and noticed 8 -10 metors in braud day light i called my son in S.E Roanoke and asked him it he seen them.  At home he went on the porch and said yes 8-10. we both also noticed jet aircraft were following a couple.  they went away and we thought there was 1 more that did not have a burn trail.  We were traveling I81 581 home from salem at 55-60 MPH and the light we thought was a meteor appeared brighter than any object in the sky.  When i got home the light was still in the sky.  It was the 2nd brightest object in the sky except for the moon.  The light appeared stationary and was not outside the atmosphere as normal stars are it was to low in the sky to be a star.  My father has witness the same light every evening since sept 2013 it appears at dusk stays 3-4 hrs and dis-appears. I contacted local media and ask if any report had been filed and was informed no.! I will monitor it tonight again and is it reappears i am going to the Roanoke star to get better view. Stars and planets do not disappear hrly on clear night and are bright enough on a cloudy night to puncture the low altitude clouds and form corna as this light does.;37.2794137055839;-79.9623659898475
Bright, reddish-orange light moving in the night sky above Roanoke, Va.;2014-01-14 19:35:00;~2 minutes;Bright, reddish-orange light moving in the night sky above Roanoke, Va. At the time and date stated above, the sky was clear, stars were plentiful.   My girlfriend and I were leaving our parked car in front of our house when we noticed a bright reddish light in the northeastern quadrant of the night sky.  My girlfriend is training to become a pilot and remarked that having only the single colored light made it appear to not be a fixed wing aircraft of any sort since it did not have the white strobe light and constant green light that most aircraft possess.   The object appeared to be moving slowly in a north-south direction, though at times it appeared to slow to a stop and even slightly adjust course before moving forward once again.   At the same time this was happening, an emergency helicopter passed overhead (in the opposite direction the UFO was moving) traveling at its normal operating altitude.  This gave us some perspective as to the relative distance the unknown object was both above us and in a distance.  We would estimate the object was in the range of 10,000 to 12,000 feet in altitude, and perhaps some three to six miles away.   We continued watching the object as it continued its’ north-south vector for some minute and a half.  Then the object stopped moving forward and hesitated briefly.  I watched as the light appeared to slowly turn on its’ axis so as the bright light was no longer shining in our direction, but now facing due east.  I could still see the light enough to tell that it was now moving forward in an easterly direction.   Once it began traveling in that direction it disappeared within two to three seconds, fading from sight very quickly.   Today I contacted the local airport and was put through to the flight control supervisor on duty.  After giving him a synopsis of the event, he took my name and number, promising to call me back once he spoken to the controllers that were on duty the night before.   He called back soon afterwards to say that he had spoken to the men who operated the radar as well as flight screens, and neither had seen anything unusual.   However, a gentleman who works in the tower told the supervisor that he had been walking towards the tower at that time and had seen the same object in the night sky. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with this witness, and we found him to be exceptionally objective and eloquent in his description of the sighting event.  We suspect that he is a highly reliable, and capable, witness.  PD));37.2794137055839;-79.9623659898475

However, from my viewpoint, there was a bright light &quotin Watching 2 planes in the sky, noted the contrails behind both airliners. However, from my viewpoint, there was a bright light in between the 2 planes.  Looked larger than either plane in the sky couldn't tell if it was because it was closer or just a larger object.  No contrails emitted from the object.   Watched for a few seconds, then it suddenly disappeared.  Watched the sky looking for it to reappear, but it didn't.  Couldn't tell if the light was coming from the object, or or reflected by the setting sun.   Would like to know if anyone else saw this happen.;37.2794137055839;-79.9623659898475

There was a stagnet star I noticed in the sky, but didn't give mind to.  It suddenly expanded into a bright fiery white/blue light and zoomed away to the left.  It made a light trail behind it as it zipped away.  I got up to see where it went but it was gone .;37.2794137055839;-79.9623659898475
