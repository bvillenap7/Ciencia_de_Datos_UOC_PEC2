PD)) I saw a triangular craft with only red light from front to back on it.  Craft stopped over my back yard and shone light down. One night I heard dogs and thought there were hunters.  I looked out window and saw light across the field in woods.  I watched light go around in trees for while then it sstarted playing game...when I looked it went out...I looked away it came on...this went on for about 15 minutes. Then light shot out of trees up and over ridge. I left and came back to look a few minutes later to see craft low over field,no blinking lights, only a long red light going from front to back of craft. It took a long time to reach crest of mtn. swinging around peak and coming down gulley of mtn. skimming trees. I got gun and went outside. The craft coming down only had light inside like a cockpit. When got close it turned off light. Stopped over back yard and shined a spotlight at my feet. I ran to house next door and looked back and it was gone.;37.2794137055839;-79.9623659898475

My wife noticed all of the lights along and the back of the object. It drifted to Christiansburg and Blacksburg like it was on a specific course. We road along the interstate and we managed to see the lighting on the side of the object. The object was alomost the length of a football field based on the length of lights on the side it. If it was a jet, you could hear the engine noise, but there was no sound at all. The object was spotted earlier in the eastern parts of VA during the morning of this event. This was told from another source prior to this sighting.;37.2794137055839;-79.9623659898475

Saw what looked like a large black triangle with red lights on all three corners hovering 400ft above my house at 0100.;2018-01-18 01:02:00;20 minutes;Saw what looked like a large black triangle with red lights on all three corners hovering 400ft above my house at 0100. I’m still having trouble processing what happened. I am composing this perhaps an hour or so after the incident occurred.  So, a little prior to 01:00 I’m sitting on the couch reading a book.  I noticed that the video I had on which was a (Bach Concerto) starts going in and out, along with the power.  I really did not think much of it until my laptop started acting strange as well.  My lap top was opened, running and unplugged, not connected to any power source.  Yet the power was effected somehow, I’m assuming it was an Electromagnetic Interference of sorts.  I proceeded to look out the front door to see if I could identify the light from my neighbors TV’s perhaps going in and out similar to mine, as many of my neighbors let their TV go all night, and you can see the glow projected on the curtains or blinds fairly easy.  Didn’t see anything out of the ordinary.  I happened to hear a crack (like a stick breaking) in my back yard.  Keep in mind this is a City setting, lots of houses VERY close to each other.  So I walk outside around to my back yard, and noticed my hair standing up.  The best way I can describe it, is that it was a similar sensation you would get from the static electricity you’d get from a statically charged balloon. Looked around, didn’t notice anything in particular. Looked up and saw what I can only describe as a black triangle with 3 red lights just hovering approximately 400ft above my house.  Completely quiet, there was no noise whatsoever.  If I would not have look up towards the sky, I would never have even known it was there.  So there was an odd electrical discharge that would occasional present itself then dissipate directly under the craft right in the middle.  Similar to the electricity you would see from a stun gun, just not as bright, I don’t know exactly what it was but thought I would mention it non the less.  Additionally, I heard some rustling way back in the yard and from behind my shed (could have been anything, even an animal) so I went back inside to get my pistol and a phone (because it has a camera), and by the time I got back outside (about 50 seconds) the object that was hovering above my house was gone.  I’m still processing this. I thought I had only looked at this! thing for about maybe a minute, but after all was said and done somehow about 20 minutes had gone by.  Never in a million years thought any of this was real, or that I would see something like this.  I don’t really no what to say other than wow.;37.2794137055839;-79.9623659898475
