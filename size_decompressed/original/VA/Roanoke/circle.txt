Children see hovering craft above house;1972-08-15 09:00:00;2 minutes+;Children see hovering craft above house When I was 12 and my brother was 11 we saw a hovering circular craft over our house about thirty feet above our house.  It had circular blinking multi=colored lights, it made no sound and hovered approximately two minutes before moving to the woods at the side of our house.  It had seemed to land but we later found no evidence.  That night after going inside there was a very bright light coming through the window filling the room.  I could not shut it out by closing my eyes and covering my head.  After that I don't remember much of the incident.We live on a dead end road surrounded by woods.  We were the first house you came to on the road.  Our driveway goes up and you can not see the house from the road, it was just off a secondary road , near the bottom of a mountain. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We do not know if it was a morning, or evening, sighting.  PD));37.2794137055839;-79.9623659898475
