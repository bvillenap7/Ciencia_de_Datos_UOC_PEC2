WHAT LOOKED LIKE STARS IN SKY THAT WERE MOVING IN FORMATION;1972-06-30 03:30:00;5 minutes;WHAT LOOKED LIKE STARS IN SKY THAT WERE MOVING IN FORMATION After work I had arrived to my grandmothers house as I always do working in a Local band getting home late…  The sky's in Roanoke - Virginia  at night are crystal clear with great visibility... a blanket thick were you could spend hours gazing (No city lights made them stand out).  Off towards the NW over Highway 81 approx 11:00 o-clock high I noticed around what appeared to be 6-8 stars that were moving all in steady formation never changing distance very slowly.... The lights were no difference in contrast as the stationary stars except these were moving very slow!!!....It was really strange because how could stars cross in formation across the sky?....The stars did not sparkle and never changed relationship to each other...it was something I'll never forget....These were not aircraft for certain I was a Airforce Dept. and knew the difference.  At first my brain couldn't comprehend what was happening  because the stationary stars did not move and there were so many of them one had to focus to see the group...The group went from left to right across the sky and slowly faded away!...The distance could not be determined from my location but I knew it was considerable....I told my wife years later and family but told no one at that time mainly because I was by myself (No one was up at 3:00 am never not even a neighbor's dog) sighting  was from the base of Mill Mountian...people that live there know what I'm saying about that hour & the clarity of the night view. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));37.2794137055839;-79.9623659898475
Observed bright twinkling object much larger than any in the sky except the moon many times Sept-Nov. ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius??  PD));2007-11-10 01:15:00;30 min;Observed bright twinkling object much larger than any in the sky except the moon many times Sept-Nov. Actually, Nov. 10, is not the first time I observwed this object, or cluster of bright, twinkling lights from my bedroom window and at close to the same time. I watched it for the first time in either late September or early October. 2007, but during this time span, I have seen it on almost a nightly frequency. As was the case on Nov. 10, 2007, it did not appear in the 1 AM-2:30 AM time span I did not see it at all, although I did look for it, but it does not ofteh skip more than one night. I have never seen it before 1 A.M., and although I get tired and my somethat arthritic neck gets sore if I stare at this object more thas 15 minutes at a time, I have looked for it when I woke up around 2:00 AM and don't recall ever seeing it there at that time.  It is always in the sky southwest of my house and usually does not move very noticeably until it has been observable for at least 15 minutes. At first glance it appears to be a very tight cluster of very bright white lights, but only a minute or so later, I see a bright red light coming from somewhere in the cluster, which seems to be a triangular formation during more of the time I am observing it. It seems to be more the tight cluster while it is standing still and when it is moving on a steady line to my left or right. But when it suddenly begins to dart about, it is impossible to determine its shape. And last night and at least two or three previous nights, one bright white light about the size of the object when I first observe it, breaks off from the original cluster, and then both the originaly cluster and the more or less satellite which mimics the slower movements of the original. If have not watched all this long eough to observe the first object and the second re-unite, but I have obsered that the first one observed and the sattelite never seem to get closer together or farther apart. I cannot say precisely what the spacing is. ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius??  PD));37.2794137055839;-79.9623659898475
3 unidentifiable green orbs were seen flying in the sky on a cloudy night.;2009-05-02 23:00:00;45 minutes;3 unidentifiable green orbs were seen flying in the sky on a cloudy night. I looked out of my window because I noticed a light green light moving very rapidly. I could not tell exactly what shape it was, because the sky was covered in clouds, but it was a definite green orb moving sporadically around the sky. I then noticed two more green lights moving with it, also sporadically. They moved very fast and turned sharply and quickly. There was no real pattern to their movements at first, but then they formed a large circle in the sky and seemed to move on a fixed rotation around the circle. At the exact same time they would change directions. They would alternate between this pattern of sporadic movement with each other and the circle. This lasted for about 30 minutes before one seemed to disappear suddenly, then another one a few minutes later, and the last one about 10 minutes after that. The only other person who I know saw this is my sister, who I woke up after watching the green lights in the sky for 10 minutes. I have never seen anything like this before in my life (the only time I've ever seen anything like it was on a show discussing UFOs, and there were videos that people submitted that resembled what I saw).;37.2794137055839;-79.9623659898475
This was brownish oddly shapped craft following under an airlplane.;2012-11-28 16:45:00;15 minutes;This was brownish oddly shapped craft following under an airlplane. I walking up to my apartment and I normally look in the sky whenever I see planes because the have always interested me.  There were two planes traveling in a sw direction there was something underneath it looking like a brown blob or something.   As I walked up the steps i saw that is had sort of backed away and then it was in the middle of the two planes.   I went in the house ran to my room and looked out of my window it looked like it had lights on it.  It was too far away for me to see it.  I have no clue what it was.   I know someone else had to have seen it.;37.2794137055839;-79.9623659898475

A tremendous magnetic pull felt from the center of my chest;2018-01-21 22:45:00;30 minutes;A tremendous magnetic pull felt from the center of my chest Last night, 1/21/18, at approximately 10:45 pm, I was snuggled under my heated blanket with my cat preparing for a good night’s sleep.  As I laid there, I heard what sounded sort of like a helicopter engine only with a slower engine rotation and not as choppy.  Very slowly the sound became increasingly louder and soon I realized it was now over my rooftop.  As I listened, I knew this was unlike anything I had ever heard before, nor could I relate the slow rate of speed in which it was traveling to any aircraft I have ever known.  I laid there not moving.  Suddenly I felt a tremendous “drawing” sensation in my chest, like a very strong magnetic “pull”.  It didn’t hurt, but my heart literally felt like it was being drawn out of my chest and I could feel a rhythmic pulsing.  At that same moment, my cat flew out from under the blankets, let out a shrill and pounced on top of the blankets, staring upwards toward the ceiling. I laid very still, resisting the urge to get up.  I watched as my cats eyes remained fixated toward the ceiling. This entire encounter lasted about 15 minutes as it slowly passed, but even after another 10-15 minutes I could still faintly hear it in a distance.;37.2794137055839;-79.9623659898475
Two blinking objects connect and then fly away together;2020-02-17 20:40:00;10:40;Two blinking objects connect and then fly away together Was taking Dog out in yard to do his thing and as I looked up in the Eastern part of sky I saw a blinking object fly toward another blinking object and attached itself to the first blinking object.  For as long as I could see them the stayed attached until out of sight.  They were close enough to see what was happening but I could not tell what shape they were since I did not have my binoculars with me.  First time I have seen this.;37.2794137055839;-79.9623659898475
