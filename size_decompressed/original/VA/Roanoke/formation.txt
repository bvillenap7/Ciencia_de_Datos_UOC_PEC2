At 17:50, on 1-31-01, we were traveling west and saw two, cloud-like shapes, one smaller above a larger second shape appearing in the western sky almost directly above the sunset. The shapes were very unusual with no vapor trails or other clouds nearby. We stopped in a parking lot to observe them. The smaller shape appeared to begin to dissipate. At this point, we noticed two dots of light,one to the right and one to the left of the smaller shape and above it. They moved very quickly toward the centerline, crossed over the smaller shape, moved to their original distances right and left and disappeared (or became unviewable). The smaller shape dissipated further to a dot of light, then rose rapidly upward and slightly to the south, then disappeared (or unviewable). The larger object remained unchanged as the sun set and we saw no further activity.;37.2794137055839;-79.9623659898475
