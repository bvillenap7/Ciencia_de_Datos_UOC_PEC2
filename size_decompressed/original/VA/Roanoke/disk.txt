After turning around i went about 3 miles and all of a sudden i saw i saw a circular disk shaped flying orb moving westward at a very fast pace.   It gave off a light blue aura and moved up and down without sound;37.2794137055839;-79.9623659898475
THREE SHIPS MOVING IN FORMATION WITH EACH OTHER.  1 WHITE 2 RED DISK SHAPE CRAFT WITH A STRANGE AURA AROUND THEM.;2011-08-11 23:00:00;20 seconds;THREE SHIPS MOVING IN FORMATION WITH EACH OTHER.  1 WHITE 2 RED DISK SHAPE CRAFT WITH A STRANGE AURA AROUND THEM. At a stoplight IN THE middle of the night no one around a seemingly busy intersection out of the corner of my right eye i spot what at first seems to be a spider web in my passenger window.  all i could see where 3 reflections of light that were bobbing up and down seemingly connected like a spider web.  i swatted at it with my hand but i soon realized the 3 points of light came into focus and i could tell they  were alien ships.  one was white and the other two were red.  they had a disk shape and emanated light from above and below there vessel.  it was truly a spectacular sight.  the whole encounter lasted no more than 30 secs as the light turned green and the lights left.  i saw a flash in my back window as i drove away.;37.2794137055839;-79.9623659898475
UFO in Roanoke.;2014-07-22 22:00:00;2 hours;UFO in Roanoke. I was in a car with my sister, because I was picking her up from night school, and all of the sudden my sister looked up into the sky.  She grabbed my shoulder, and I slammed on the brakes, then looked up, and I saw it.   It looked like a disc with some weird red light on the bottom, I was so stunned that I didn't try to get my phone for a couple seconds, and when I looked back up from getting it, the disc just flashed and I saw a beam.   I woke up two hours later.  My sister had a mark on her neck, like a drill went in or something, and my phone was broken, like a charge sparked through it.   I will be sending some pictures of the mark, in a day or so.   I'm really scared, every car-light I see freaks me out now.;37.2794137055839;-79.9623659898475

They flew horizontal over trees.   The stop light took another 45 seconds to change, so I sped up to pull over to snap a photo but they were too far away and went behind Mountain;37.2794137055839;-79.9623659898475
