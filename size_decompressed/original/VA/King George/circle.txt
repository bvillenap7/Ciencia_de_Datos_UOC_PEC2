Metallic colored ball in the sky;2008-10-19 14:00:00;10 minutes;Metallic colored ball in the sky At about 14:00 my girl friend and I took my son outside to play. There was a loud aircraft noise directly above us that made us look up to see what it was. When we tracked the plane it was headed north, than we saw a metallic colored ball just in front of it. The plane flew by and the object stayed still and than a couple of planes flew by it, than it started moving south from lets say the 2 O'clock to 10 o'clock ,if that makes since. The object stayed there for a long time. We got tired of looking so we just ignored it. I thought about getting out of the camcorder, but I figured that I wouldn't be able to pick up the object very well.
