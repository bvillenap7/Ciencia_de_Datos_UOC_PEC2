UFO seen between US Army Fort AP Hill/Caroline and King George County on US-301 Southbound;2011-12-05 17:35:00;30 seconds;UFO seen between US Army Fort AP Hill/Caroline and King George County on US-301 Southbound Driving south on US-301 in King George, VA 3 miles north of US Army Fort A.P. Hill/Port Royal, VA. The weather was very cloudy and it was dusk about 10 mins. before dark. A object was hovering in the sky at ~1000 ft. and about ~2 miles ahead of me.  I don't know how to describe the object, i.e. a definitive triangle, cigar, etc... However, the object resembled the shape of an SR-71 blackbird with except it was not black at all.  At first the object appeared as two bright white/blue lights side by side.   As I drove south, for about 30 seconds, I stared at the object and noticed it appeared to have 3 sides, but more similar to a space shuttle or blackbird or some kind of hypersonic vehicle with what I think was 2 lights on each side. Here is what made me stare at it for 30 seconds:  It was extraordinarily bright and stayed in the same position in the sky the entire time I saw it. Just as fast as the object appeared it vanished.;38.2821;-77.1306
