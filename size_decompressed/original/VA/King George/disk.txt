Several Disc Shaped Objects and One Orange Star Like Object.;2014-10-26 18:30:00;5-10 minutes;Several Disc Shaped Objects and One Orange Star Like Object My wife and I were traveling westbound on Kings Highway in King George, VA, at roughly 38.277993, -77.209848 when to the west my wife and I both noticed several unusual objects in the sky.  At first glance they looked like very short contrails but as we continued to observe them we noticed that they were stationary and not becoming longer like a contrail. I was driving and had to pay attention to the road but my wife says she counted 9 of these disc shaped objects before they disappeared one at a time.  By the time she took pictures only two remained. I think in a couple of the pictures there are three of them. Not only did we see these objects to the west but we both saw one blinking orange star like object which was roughly to the south of our position at approximately 45 degrees (just taking a guess on that). I saw this object looking out the driverâ€™s side window while still traveling westbound.  It looked a lot like a very bright Mars but I am certain it was not a planet or an airplane.  It was not quite dark yet and no stars were visible at that time. It was unlike anything I have seen in the sky before. I looked at it and it disappeared.  It did not blink like an airplane and I wouldn't exactly say it pulsated. It was more like a slow steady blink with roughly 10-15 seconds between blinks until it just disappeared.  It seemed stationary and I definitely believe it was in our atmosphere and not in space.  I feel that the star like object was closer to us but it is very hard to tell.
