3 fireballs floating in the sky.;2018-08-13 20:20:00;1-2 minutes;3 fireballs floating in the sky. Driving south on US-301, passing through Edgehill, I was trailing a lightning storm that was moving to the South East, when two balls of fire floating just above the tree line ahead of me came into view.   After driving past the light at the intersection with VA-205, a third fireball came into view with the other two.  They passed beyond sight behind the same treeline until I drove over Pine Hill Creek, where they came into view once more.  This time, however, all three were on the opposite side of the road and were spotted through the trees.   When I came to a clearing near the intersection of US-301 and VA-3, they had vanished. NOTE: The three fireballs took no obvious formation, though, anyone could make a triangle from three points on a plane.;38.2821;-77.1306
