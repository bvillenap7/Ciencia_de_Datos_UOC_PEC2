The sky was clear and the moon was full and bright.  I could see the entire Big Dipper in the sky in the direction I was heading.   Near the bottom two stars was a brilliant, bright, vivid, and defined light streaking across the sky (left to right or right to left) but only for a distance relative to an inch when looking at it between my pointer and thumb with my arm extended.  It happened so fast but the light was so bright and intense for the sky.  There were plenty of planes in the sky and this was obviously not a plane.  I've seen plenty of shooting stars and this was obviously not a shooting star.  I immediately called a friend and turned around cutting my paddle short.  I'm hoping someone else saw it or can explain what it was. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
