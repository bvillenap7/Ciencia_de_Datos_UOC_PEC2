Silent and perfectly still.  Central red blinking light. Vanished within a few seconds. Driving home Friday 13th March, 2015, with my dad, when I spotted 2 lights that looked like car headlights, but were extremely bright.   We continued driving and discovered a central, dimmer red blinking light and one other white light behind it, the object was not symmetrical.  It hovered perfectly still above the trees a few hundred feet above the ground.  I rolled the window down to listen for helicopter blades but heard nothing.   Convinced we had seen something very out of the ordinary, we turned around as soon as possible, when we got to where it had been, it had vanished.  We eliminated the possibility of the object being the nearby cell tower because it was too high up, and too far away from the school that the tower stands next to.;38.0520987041037;-78.4915911447087
