I was on the way to see my sister and her family on this new years eve and was crossing the bridge in Albermarle county over the watershed for the city of Charlottesville, va.  There to the left of the rail on the bridge was a certifiable flying saucer.  It was close to the edge of dark, but the object was very clearly there and was just hovering there.  The  top was concave and around the bottom were windows and there seemed to be a light on inside as light was coming from each one. I took off as soon as I got a good look since it was so obvious what it was.  It was gone when I came back later that night.  (The date is appox. since I can't remember the exact year.   My ex wouldn't let me tell anyone about this for fear of drawing attention to himself as he hadn't filed his income taxes in a lot of years and was afraid of being fingered!)   The saucer was silver and about the size of a city bus.  A friend of mine had seen something that followed her home ab! out the same time frame and there was a write up in the paper about it.  I wanted to contact her for details, but wasn't allowed to do so.  I should do it now, even after all these years.   I am telling this now in the hopes that someone can shed some info on my sighting of the 80's. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary time for the sighting.  PD));38.0520987041037;-78.4915911447087

I got to the road and I saw the saucer come out from behind the trees above the road very closeby. It passed over the road and went behind some trees. It had to have been extremely low to vanish beneath these trees. I could see it was distinctly round-shaped (not aircraft) and it was so close but completely silent. No noise from engine or anything. If it was a normal aircraft or helicopter the noise from this distance would have been loud. It had a few red and yellow lights flashing at intervals and it went directly across the road about three hundred feet away from me. It went so low under the trees, it was really ridiculous. The next day I told my friend i had met and he was astounded, he had saw it also from back at his house! He said it was as exactly as i described it and that he saw it in the same place. From his couch, he has a view of the area over my house and my neighbors, (where i saw it.) I am so glad he saw it otherwise people woulda thought i was crazy. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
