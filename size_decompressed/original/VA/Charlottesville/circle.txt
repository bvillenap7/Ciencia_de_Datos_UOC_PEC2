3 amber orbs forming a triangle then a straight line then disappearing.;2012-10-22 18:30:00;15 minutes;3 amber orbs forming a triangle then a straight line then disappearing. 11/22/2012   ((sic.  10/22/2012))    18:30 Hours On 81 North just outside of Charlottesville Virginia Three glowing amber orbs were spotted high in the sky, around the same level as the 4 planes flying within viewing distance of it.  The spots appeared one by one until all three were visible.  The dots made the shape of a triangle, each representing a separate point, and within a few seconds the dots formed a straight line then individually disappeared.   The whole incident took between 8 and 15 minutes.  The funny thing was as these dots formed the straight line the other planes special position never changed.  Can you please explain what this was?;38.0520987041037;-78.4915911447087
Bright, white glowing, orb-like object hovering above tree line in front yard—no sound, moved quickly, disappearing and reappearing 2x.;2017-05-10 22:00:00;15-20 seconds;Bright, white glowing, orb-like object hovering above tree line in front yard—no sound, moved quickly, disappearing and reappearing 2x. I observed a bright white-glowing, orb-like object hovering above the tree line to the left of my front yard near Route 20 North in Albamarle County, Virginia.  The object was stationary for a few seconds, moved quickly from its position, and then disappeared for a few seconds.  It reappeared a few moments later, moved quickly again, and then disappeared from view entirely.  The object made no sound.;38.0520987041037;-78.4915911447087
Green orb light balls at 4:31am in Charlottesville, VA  ((NUFORC Note:  Rocket launch from Wallops Island.  PD));2017-06-29 04:31:00;2 minutes;Green orb light balls at 4:31am in Charlottesville, VA Birds were chirping very loudly outside of my apartment around 4:00am in the morning.  The volume of the chirping progressed to the point where I decided to see if there was a nest outside my apartment because I could not fall asleep.  When I opened the door, there was a large green ball shaped object fairly low in the sky (lower than the moon which was not visible from my door).  I quickly called my boyfriend to the door to see and as he came to the door, the single ball separated or multiplied into two balls which grew in size then dissolved slowly.   Seconds after, two more ball appeared (almost looked like they popped in the sky), then four more in perfect symmetry they appeared like a number four looks like on dice. Seconds after that, another burst of four balls 'popped' in the sky.  My boyfriend and I both did double takes as we could not believe what we were seeing.  Additionally, we found the birds' behavior perplexing as I have never heard birds before at that hour of the morning nor have I seen them be so active (dodging and fleeting from tree to tree).  Shortly after all the balls dissolved into the sky (total of about a minute, two at most), the birds chirping ceased and the night was quiet once again.  Lastly, we speculated that it could be fireworks but there were no sounds coming from the lights or any other sounds other than the birds that we could hear.  The balls did evolve in color, beginning in green, then to yellowish orange color until they faded away completely.  I did take a single photo towards the end when they were mostly dissolved, but the outlines of the balls can be seen.;38.0520987041037;-78.4915911447087
Group of several orange lights, seemingly circular.  Lights did not blink.   ((anonymous report));2019-06-20 23:28:00;15 seconds;Group of several orange lights, seemingly circular.  Lights did not blink.   Object appeared to be like a plane, but the color and speed wasn’t correct, and it seemed closer and lower than a plane.  Slow and steady course.   After it disappeared into the clouds, the same exact thing happened about 1-2 minutes later (a second identical object on what seemed like the same flight path). ((NUFORC Note:  Time indicated by witness may have been flawed.  We have amended it, in order to indicate a nighttime sighting.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information, so we are unable to confirm the time.  PD));38.0520987041037;-78.4915911447087

They didn’t catch my attention.... until one moved extremely fast, in a straight line with a tail behind it... across the sky. It stayed in my vision and then disappeared. It was very high up, with the stars. It didn’t look like any shooting star or meteor I have ever seen. This is the first sighting I have had this month, and I had the second sighting last night. Really concerns me.;38.0520987041037;-78.4915911447087
