Bright fiery contrail in eastern night sky;2005-10-31 21:17:00;5-10 seconds;Bright fiery contrail in eastern night sky Looking east on my way into the house tonight, I saw a long contrail of light/flame across quite a bit of the sky.  Too high to be a firework.   I could vaguely still make out a smoke plume where it occurred for a minute or so afterward.  Looked like the space shuttle taking off in the night sky only it was straight across the sky, not going up from the ground. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes self as a pilot.  Our suspicion is that he is a quite experienced pilot, with many thousands of hours of flight time.  However, that is just a guess on our part.  PD));38.0520987041037;-78.4915911447087
