Spot of honey-colored light, spherical- barely 3x larger than stars- seen from car;2003-12-18 18:25:00;10-15 minutes;Spot of honey-colored light, spherical- barely 3x larger than stars-seen from car Driving north on 29, about 10 minutes past Charlottesville. I noticed the stars were out (it was cloudy earlier) and very visible- Among them I could clearly see a spherical shape- not just a starlike point of light, maybe at most three times bigger than the stars around it- softly glowing a honey color. It was almost at the zenith, but just in front of us. It seemed to hover, but it was moving amongst the constellations, so that ruled out it being a star or planet. After about 10 or so minutes (it felt like a very long time) during which the object had drifted off to the side (I watched it) the road became more winding and trees obscured my view. I was wearing glasses, so my vision was 20/20. My roommate was driving, so she couldn't have seen it (looked up).;38.0520987041037;-78.4915911447087
Bright orangish-reddish light, not flashing, traveling through the sky and then disappeared completely.;2006-11-04 22:00:00;7 minutes;Bright orangish-reddish light, not flashing, traveling through the sky and then disappeared completely. On a very clear night, my roomate and I were on our back porch looking south. We saw a strange orange-redish light that was moving very slowly perpendicular to the trees.   It was hard to tell if it had any tail at all.  It continued moving up and then slowly veered off the the left.  As it continued moving upwards, it began to get dimmer.   After a period of about a minute or so, it became smaller and smaller until it completely disappeared.   Many planes flew by in the area and the oject was moving much slower than the planes and had no flashing lights.   It seemed to disappear right above a star, but the star could have been Venus too?;38.0520987041037;-78.4915911447087
Wandering lights in the sky over Charlottesville, VA;2007-12-16 20:30:00;30 minutes;Wandering lights in the sky over Charlottesville, VA Several flying lights were seen by three persons. The lights changed in color and intensity, although luminosity was maintained at comparable brightness to stars in the vicinity, over the course of the half hour in which they were seen, the objects also meandered across the sky, going various directions at most times, while stopping and staying still for more than five minutes at a time.  The first light was observed heading SW, then NW, then N, then back to the south, and so on. Eventually, three of the objects made a triangular formation.  Several attempts were made at photographic evidence, but the cameras in use were not powerful enough to pick up the lights clearly.   At some points, the lights moved fast enough to leave behind a slight tail of disturbance in the atmosphere.  Several commercial planes were observed in the vicinity of some of the objects, but distance was not able to be judged without better instrumentation to be able to determine how close the planes were to the objects.;38.0520987041037;-78.4915911447087
Orange lights near Monticello, Charlottesville, VA;2012-09-08 23:18:00;5 minutes;Orange lights near Monticello, Charlottesville, VA I was traveling eastbound on State Route 250/Richmond Road.  The sky was shrouded in cloud cover and no stars or moon were visible.  I was passing a stone quarry on the right side of the road (facing south) when I saw approximately 20 orange-colored lights in a vertical formation in the sky beyond the quarry area.  Geographically, the area below the lights is uninhabited since all the land beyond the quarry is part of Monticello, Thomas Jefferson’s estate.  This property is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. I continued to see the orange lights intermittently as I drove (dense trees blocked my view), then I turned on to County Road 729/N.  Milton Road and pulled into a the school parking lot.  I saw 3-4 of the lights only by that time.  As I watched with another observer who had arrived there shortly before I had, there were 3 lights that moved slowly upwards and towards each other.  Then they faded from view. The other observer I spoke to stated he had made several attempts to photograph the lights on his phone, but though he could capture other lights nearby, there was no image when he tried to photograph the orange lights.  He stated he had also traveled east on Rte 250 and he had also seen the 20 orange lights in formation as I had seen them a few minutes earlier.  There were also 2 tour buses idling in the parking lot, but I did not check to see if the drivers were present or had witnessed the event;38.0520987041037;-78.4915911447087
Three red lights in a diagonal line rose in the sky, vibrated then went out.;2012-11-29 20:30:00;1 minute;Three red lights in a diagonal line rose in the sky, vibrated then went out. I saw three orange-red lights making a diagonal line in the sky.  The line was rising in the sky.  The lights began to make sporadic movements while staying in the same general location.  First, the top light went out and then turned into a dim white light, then the second and the third lights did the same thing.;38.0520987041037;-78.4915911447087
Series of Orange lights moving quietly across the sky with intent and order.;2013-03-30 20:20:00;2 minutes;Series of Orange lights moving quietly across the sky with intent and order. Orange light seen approaching from the east then hovering in the NNW sky.  then a series of 6 more lights very close together arrived in the same manner and hovered, then aligned in a straight line. during their alignment 2-3 more lights arrived.  As the appeared to hover, the light diminished in color and intensity. The two observers were sitting outside on a deck facing north enjoying the early Spring evening.  One observer is a pilot.  It was just starting to get cold.  One observer saw the lights approaching from the East and we were surprised there was no noise associated with the movement of the lights.  And no flickering red or green lights.  Only an oragne glow.;38.0520987041037;-78.4915911447087
Yellowish, single, steady and silent ball of light with a contrail.  ((NUFORC Note:  Could not have been the ISS.  PD));2013-10-17 22:18:00;3-5 minutes;Yellowish, single, steady and silent ball of light with a con trail I stand outside at night frequently, smoking cigarettes and checking out the night sky.  I see aircraft all the time, and an occasional shooting star.  One night, I clearly saw a meteor.  I know when I'm looking at a planet.  I've seen the ISS pass by before, and I've seen satellites, as well.  That's my sky-watching background. Tonight was the first time I could ever say without a doubt that I saw an object that I had absolutely no idea what I'd just seen. It was coming from the West.  At first, I thought it was a really bright star, but then I noticed it was moving to the East.  It grew bigger, and brighter, and headed right towards the moon.  I'd say it moved from ~35 degrees up to a maximum of 60 or so.  The moon was at ~65-75.   When it passed between me and the moon, appearing a few degrees below it, I saw the contrail.  Whatever it was, it was in the atmosphere. When I saw that, I thought it might be a meteor or something else burning up, but it didn't look like it was on fire, or diminishing at all.   Honestly, I was expecting the trajectory to bend downward at any second and see it pop or fizzle.  But it just kept going. It did look a little like one of those large airplane lights that are usually in the center of commercial airliners, but there were no accompanying flashing lights, or even steady smaller lights, which I always see on commercial airliners.  It was just a steady, yellowish ball of light with a con trail, and the trail didn't resemble any meteor trail I've ever seen. There's an airport just North of the city, so I see a lot of low-flying jetliners going in for landings.  This was absolutely not one of those. It was much larger than any planet, shooting star, meteor or aircraft light I've ever seen. It also made absolutely no sound. As it continued straight in the direction it was heading, I tried to get my phone's camera on it, but the light from the moon was too much.  I could only watch it as it kept a steady course towards the Eastern horizon. When it was barely visible to me, I turned back to the West, looking where it had come from, and saw 3 aircraft crisscrossing the sky at low altitudes relative to what I usually see out there, and flying routes I don't usually see. I like to post meteor sightings to see if anyone else saw what I saw.  I didn't believe it was a meteor, so I googled a short description of what I saw, and ufocenter.com was the first site returned.  So, I decided to post it here and hope someone else might have seen it too.;38.0520987041037;-78.4915911447087
Orange lights in sky just after midnight on New Years Eve seen over Charlottesville, VA.;2014-01-01 00:10:00;10 minutes;Orange lights in sky just after midnight on New Years Eve seen over Charlottesville, VA. We just saw something very strange.  Orange flying somethings. Not blinking and silent. At first we thought embers.  But they were large like planes.  And then they just disappeared. 2 at first, with one breaking away from the other and heading overhed and then they disappeared.  Then 2 more with one ahead and a little lower a few minutes later.  They both disappeared.  All were coming from the WNW going about East except for the one that turned to the ESE.  My husband tried called the non-emergency number to the 911 center and it said it wasn't working. We are baffled.;38.0520987041037;-78.4915911447087
Red ball of light, became a halo as it moved up into the sky, flew erratically then straightened out.;2014-02-22 20:00:00;45 seconds;Red ball of light, became a halo as it moved up into the sky, flew erratically then straightened out One object came up from the South.  It started low on the horizon, and I thought it was just a plane heading North for a landing, as planes often fly over from that direction as they're heading North to land at the airport. The object was really low, though, and right as I was about to look away, I saw it jerk to the West suddenly.  My initial reaction was “what the hell?”  I thought then that it might be a meteor that was splitting up, and that it was so low it might hit nearby. My view was partially obscured by the bare branches of a tree in front of me, so I moved out away from the tree to see if I could verify it was just an aircraft or meteor.  I kept my eye on the thing as I walked out away from the building I live at, and it continued to jerk side to side as it headed North. When I got a good view of it without any obstructions, I could tell it wasn't a plane.  There were no flashing lights.  It wasn't making any sound at all, and it was moving significantly faster than any aircraft that pass by here.   As I watched, I noticed it was gaining altitude.  It wasn't heading straight up, but it definitely arced upwards and kept on its path North.  After a few seconds, the jerking motions stopped and the center of the object actually blacked out while I still had a clear, unobstructed view, so the thing became this dim red halo of light against the night sky. I watched it a few more seconds, thinking it was going to disappear, because it was definitely headed up, but it actually picked up speed and just kept going North.  Last I saw, it was speeding off.  I could barely catch it through the trees when it neared the Northern horizon, but I could still make out the light through the tree branches.;38.0520987041037;-78.4915911447087
Single steady white light, no sound, moving from West to East.;2014-06-06 04:24:00;2 minutes;Single steady white light, no sound, moving from West to East Doing my usual star-gazing this morning, I saw what looked like a star heading West to East.  It did not fly in a straight line, but had the erratic movement that I'm used to see in these things now.  Reminds me of a drunk trying to get somewhere fast. It was a about as bright as a star, smaller than Jupiter, and the light was steady.  No contrail. Definitely not a meteor.  It crossed the entire sky and must've been really high, as it faded out of sight after a couple of minutes for a few seconds, and then came back into view for 20 seconds or so before fading out for good.  There were no other lights, nothing blinking, and there was no noise accompanying it. Within 10 seconds or so after that disappeared, I heard what I though was a helicopter coming from where that light had originated, and looked back Northwest to where the light had come from, only to see an even bigger light moving even faster, bearing southwest this time.  At first I thought it was a helicopter, but the sound accompanying it faded out while the light kept moving.  I then thought it might be the ISS, and it turned out it was.  I was able to verify that it had just passed over when I came back inside using the tracker site. I watched the ISS speed away, and immediately saw a third light directly above me, heading straight South.  This one was smaller than the first, and I pegged it as a satellite because it had the usual dim steady light and relatively slow straight movement compared to the first light.;38.0520987041037;-78.4915911447087
5 white lights in succession.;2014-09-23 21:00:00;45-60 seconds;5 white lights in succession. Saw 5 steady white lights in succession, with no accompanying blinking lights.  All but the last moved out from behind a tree about 60 yards from me.  They weren’t too far above the horizon, and off a long distance beyond the tree.  They all looked like a steady bright light on an airliner, but there’s no way they could have been. The first one, I thought it was just an airliner flying low from West to East, but I noticed it was moving really fast.  Then it stopped.  Dead stop, and took a right turn to move away from me, to the South.  Then it disappeared.  The whole thing took between 3 and 6 seconds, I think. I watched, and within a few seconds, saw another one pop out from behind the tree.  It was moving in the opposite direction of the first, from East to West.  It lasted for a few seconds, then disappeared.  Same kind of light as before.  I kept watching and it was like de ja vu.  2 more lights just like the second on exactly the same path, same timing, but I was moving towards them as I watched and I saw some other movement on one of them that was so fast it was hard to catch. That whole event lasted another 10 seconds or so, and then I saw the last one, and it was headed straight at me, getting bigger as it moved.  Like the others, it was only visible for a few seconds, then it disappeared, and that was it. The whole event couldn’t have last more than 45-60 seconds.  I saw the blinking lights of an aircraft of some kind heading from the North right towards where the lights appeared within a minute of when they stopped.;38.0520987041037;-78.4915911447087
Extraordinarily bright fading in an out, changing positions.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus and Jupiter?  PD));2015-06-15 22:30:00;20 minutes;Extraordinarily bright fading in an out, changing positions I was driving home from Bible Study in Charlottesville to Waynesboro on I-64.  Around exit 113 which is Ivy exit.  I saw a bright bright star or what I thought was a star on my left hand side driving west on 64.  I tried to capture it on my cell phone but could not get a picture.   After stopping to try to get a picture, I got back on the highway and it disappeared.  It reappeared again on my right, but now there were two both very bright and one slightly behind the other and lower.  Both faded away, and one reappeared again in front of me still driving west on 64.  I took the exit 94 and saw it again same brightness and lower but on my left again.  After getting on my street where I live I didn't see them anymore.  This is the second time I have seen these lights.  The first time again driving home from Bible Study but this one single one was a triangle shaped which kept fading in and out and each time in a different place.  Didn't really scare me.  I just found it odd.   If these were stars, why were they brighter than the others and closer and odd shapes. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a sighting of Venus and Jupiter, both of which are in the western sky, currently, during the early to late evening.  PD));38.0520987041037;-78.4915911447087
What pulsating bar light on craft, apparently, with no sound...;2016-10-31 22:35:00;~5 minutes;What pulsating bar light on craft, apparently, with no sound... Outside smoking and checking out the sky, like I do every night. Been a while since I've seen anything worth reporting. I live a 20 minute drive from a major airport, so I'm constantly seeing commercial and personal aircraft coming and going all over the place.  This thing was not one of those things. There was no sound.  I only noticed it because I was looking up at the few stars I could see through the lite cloud cover.  First saw it right above me, and it had to have been at commercial aircraft level, so it was quite a ways away.  At first I just thought it was a commercial flight that had just taken off, but the lights weren't anything I'd seen before. Maybe it's something new, I don't know.  But instead of the usual flood-lights in from and small blinking white and read lights, I saw one long bar of white light pulsing at a steady, moderate, constant rate that did not change, accompanied by a pulsating round red light to the left of the white bar. I've never seen a white pulsating bar on any aircraft in my life.  So, I kept watching, wondering what it might be, and as it moved away, I noticed it appeared to sort of wobble left to right as it went, but it's extremely hard to tell when it's so dark out.  That could very well have just been my eyes not having any focal points.  I've seen stars appear to jump and wobble, so I can't say it was wobbling for sure. Other than that, it was on a fairly straight path North to South.  Right from the direction of the airport (North.)  As I watched it, that's when I realized I heard no sound. There's no way I would have missed sound from any commercial or private aircraft.  Just doesn't happen.  Any time I see a plane, I know the sound will hit after the usual delay.  Or I hear the plane and know where to find it by the sound.  This thing... no sound at all... none.  Not normal.  And it was moving at a pretty slow pace compared to major aircraft leaving the airport.  About the speed of a small aircraft. Unfortunately, in the dark, I couldn't tell how high it was, or what its size might be. Another I'll mention because it was very odd, although it may not be related at all... earlier in the day I heard a helicopter outside hanging around for a while... at least 3-5 minutes. I've lived here for a year and half and in this city for nearly a decade now, and I've never seen or heard any helicopter do that.  Every helicopter I've ever seen was headed somewhere and never hung around.  Maybe not be related, and it was at least a couple hours before I saw these lights, but I thought it was worth mentioning.;38.0520987041037;-78.4915911447087
