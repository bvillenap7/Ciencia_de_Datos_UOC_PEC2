Orange/Red lights in the sky that completely reversed direction in flight.;2016-12-24 21:02:00;5 minutes;Orange/Red lights in the sky that completely reversed direction in flight. Very strange orange/red lights (4 separate craft) in the South Eastern sky. Very bright. At first thought they were planes but there were no flashing lights or sound.  They moved in a zig zag pattern and suddenly reversed direction completely.  After reversing direction, they winked out and were no longer able to be seen.   They moved fast for a plane but not so fast that it was impossible to be a plane.  Not sure if they could be drones but it was at 9 pm on Christmas Eve and the weather was extremely foggy.  VERY WEIRD!!!!;38.0520987041037;-78.4915911447087
