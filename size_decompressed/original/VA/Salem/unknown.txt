Bright object changing colors of green, orange, white that bounced around.  ((NUFORC Note:  Star or planet??  PD));2010-09-08 11:00:00;3 hours;Bright object changing colors of green, orange, white that bounced around For several nights, starting a week ago I noticed something in the sky. I knew it wasn’t a star because of the way it “bounced” around. We used my husbands rifle scope to try to get a closer look, and low and behold it definitely wasn’t something normal. It lighted up green, white and orange and would grow dim, then light up brightly. My husband described it as “electrifying”. I first noticed it in the west of the big dipper towards Elliston. Then noticed it in the northeast part towards Troutville . Last night we saw it towards Elliston and then saw two jets in formation flying in its direction. About 10 mins later it was gone. About an hour later I went outside and sure enough, it was in the northeast part of the sky towards Troutville. I have tried taking video of it, but will need to get the tripod out to get a stable shot of it. ((NUFORC Note:  Star or planet??  PD));37.2850787234043;-80.069629787234
