((anonymous report));2017-09-26 20:45:00;40 minutes;Was standing in the driveway looked up and to the right noticed a red strobing light flashing from left to right.  Looked like three red lights tightly formed in the front of object then a red light flashing from top to bottom.  Object was incoming to my location, then stopped and hovered for several minutes.   Took out cellphone and began recording object for over 40min.  Took still photos as well.  Object then proceeded to move off away from my vicinity but stopped to hover again.  I walked up the road to get a clearer view away from the tree lin and the object proceeded to loiter around the area for a long time.  It would move left to right then come closer to me never getting as close as I would have liked.   All lights on this object were red and moved in irregular patterns sometimes the horizontal lights would go then the vertical would flash.  I do not believe this object was a standard aircraft as it made no sound.  And I do not believe it was a drone because of ! lengh of time of observation and battery kimitations on drone vehicles.  I went to retrieve a neighbor to witness as well but on returning the object had left.  I had a similar sighting about 8 years ago from much further away in the early am and on that occasion 2 F-16's gave chase.
