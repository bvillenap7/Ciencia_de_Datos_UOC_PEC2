Silver-aluminum like cylinder object in broad day light on I-81!!;2005-07-25 17:00:00;5-10;Silver-aluminum like cylinder object in broad day light on I-81!! My fiance and I were on I-81 South on our way back from Roanoke, Va.  It was a cloudless day-and I was looking up at the top of the mountains as my fiance was driving.  Suddenly I noticed a aluminum-like metal (it was like no metal i've seen before-looked like silver but more aluminum.) circular object just floating around the mountians.  It seemed to be moving the exact way we were going on the Interstate-south.  Suddenly the circular object turned to the side and I noticed it was really cylnder/cigar like shaped.  I then told my fiance to look up but he was driving, and he decided to pull over, b/c I was really going off, I knew this wasn't a normal craft.  As he was pulling over, my eyes stayed fixed on the object.  Then-it just disappered-right in front of eyes!!  It just faded away!!  Well, we got back on the road, and a half a mile or so down the road, on the opposite side-there it was again!  That time my fiance could see it perfectly through the sun roof as he was driving.  It seemed to be going pretty fast-almost keeping up with us as we were driving.  Then, we BOTH seen it disappered/fade away again!  I say faded away b/c you could literally see it getting lighter and lighter, and then gone!!  I think it had to be the same object as the first time, unless there was several out that day.  But, both times I only seen one.  Reading other experiences on here sounded just like a similar object we had seen so I had to post my experience.  I'll never forget it!!
