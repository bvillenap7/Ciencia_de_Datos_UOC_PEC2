Fast moving formation that looked much like the London sighting.;2009-03-25 14:00:00;2-3 sec;Fast moving formation that looked much like the London sighting. It was on a clear day last week, around the 25th of March. I was standing next to my house, looking up at the sky, observing the chemtrails which I do often. It wasn't a heavy chemtrail day, just a couple of Xes and lines that were spreading out. Suddenly I noticed something moving quickly past the trails. My eyes focused on what I first thought was a flock of birds in the far distance. It looked like bunch of dots in a formation. I'm wasn't sure how many, maybe ten or twelve, because this formation of dots was moving very fast. When I noticed them, they were directly in front of me, but within 2 to 3 seconds they had traveled across the sky to my left until they vanished in the distance. I stood there a few minutes thinking about what I just saw, wondering what it could have been. If it wasn't for the speed, it could have been a flock of birds so far away that they looked like dots. Then I thought it could have been a group of insects that were quite close to me streaking by and staying in a perfect formation. Maybe a squadron of jet fighters? But there was no noise made by this UFO. I thought it couldn't have been any of these things because it was just moving to fast. I didn't think much more about my sighting until last night when I saw the photo of the London sighting. It appears to be the same kind of formation only closer to the viewer. Could it be that there's a UFO squadron speeding around globe? I think it's a possibility.  I have a degree in Nursing and have worked in the manufacturing field.
