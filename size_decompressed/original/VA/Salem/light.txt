Light in the ski far south of Salem Virginia on a clear late afternoon.;2008-02-28 17:30:00;30 minutes;Light in the ski far south of Salem Virginia on a clear late afternoon. It was around 5:30pm and the sky was clear and bright. As me and my son(13)was coming out of the Wal-Mart in Salem Virginia i looked up in the ski to the far south.  And I then told my son to look at that bright light in the sky.  We didn't see a shape but it look like one headlight in the sky traveling backwards.   At first this light wasn't moving fast.  It actually look like it was just sitting still. Then we looked up a little higher and we saw three jets at first they look like they was just going across but then they starting racing towards the light.  At first I thought they were regular plane but they were too high and moving fast. Then the light starting moving south.   As the jets got closer to the light it stated to move faster.  So I told my son to get in the car because it's going in the direction we are going.  I could barely keep my eyes on the road because i was too busy looking up accident waiting to happen.   As we travel south on 460 to the Elliston area the light started to slight disapear (it look like it was now some where past blacksburg area) then from the southeast we saw another jet or miltary plane moving fast in the same direction as the other 3 jets and the Light.  After that i couldn't see any more because of the mountains.   Whatever it was the i know the military was going after.   If i saw that Light' i know others had to see it as well.   I am Christain and i believe in GOD and i don't believe in UFO or anything like that.  But after seeing what me and my son saw today make me think other wise.   I sometimes hear the miliatary planes fly over our area for training purposes but this time they were no-where to heard but only to be seen racing across the sky.;37.2850787234043;-80.069629787234
Light in the sky.;2015-05-15 22:10:00;1 second;Light in the sky. I saw a bright flash in the sky that was not lightning, had a circular shape and lasted about a second, and was somewhat brighter than lightning with a blueish-white color to it.  Seen AS SOON as I walked to my window. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));37.2850787234043;-80.069629787234
Extremely bright circular light shooting horizontally in sky and disappeared as if flying behind something in clear night sky.;2019-06-14 10:00:00;1-2 seconds;Extremely bright circular light shooting horizontally in sky and disappeared as if flying behind something in clear night sky. As I was listening to a friend talk to a group of four of us, I saw a light as bright as the full moon but smaller in size, which was about 1/8 the size of the moon, travel in a perfectly straight line horizontally across the sky and disappeared into absolutely nothing.  There were no clouds and the moon was full and bright.  The light traveled faster than any airplane and was not a shooting star.  There was no tail or lagging light behind the object.  The size of the object was so large it could never be misinterpreted as an aircraft.  The manner at which it disappeared into thin air was a complete mystery.  I have never seen anything similar to this, and matter of fact have never seen anything other than aircraft and an occasional shooting star a handful of times.  As I yelled “Did you guys see that?” I actually startled everyone because they actually did not see what I had because it was behind them.  This is definitely a little scary, mysterious, and totally unexplainable.;37.2850787234043;-80.069629787234
