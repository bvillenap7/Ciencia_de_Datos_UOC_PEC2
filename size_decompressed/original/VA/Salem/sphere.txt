Green sphere visible over I-81 North in Roanoke County, Virginia at about 18:30 on December 23rd.;2007-12-23 18:30:00;3 seconds;Green sphere visible over I-81 North in Roanoke County, Virginia at about 18:30 on December 23rd. I was driving down interstate 81 north and was admiring the moon.  The sky was clear.   Suddenly, a bright green orb with a short white tail flashed across the sky right under the moon.  It was much larger than surrounding stars and visible planets and was much larger than comets I have seen.  It was visible for only a second and then vanished without even leaving a trail.   I have witnessed airplanes and meteor showers, but this object was very large, it appeared to be about a tenth of the size of the moon, and did not continue in a straight path for as long as a falling star or airplane would.  My sister, who was sitting in the passenger seat at the time, also saw the object.   There were no nearby cars whose headlights could have been mistaken for reflecting the appearance of such an apparition.;37.2850787234043;-80.069629787234
Green sphere obsereved in southwest virginia;2016-07-04 23:15:00;1 hour;Green sphere obsereved in southwest virginia I was walking my dogs and started watching the end of a fireworks display when I noticed a green sphere off in the northeastern sky far from where the display was going on.  Put the dogs away and just watched the sphere from my pouch through a set of power lines.   The green object changed altitudes several times as viewed through the power lines then turned to a glowing red and sped off the northwest.  It reappeared after a few minutes to the previous position and turned back to a green color where it stayed for a while.   After the display was over the object turned red and shot straight up in the sky.   I need to mention the weather, which was solid low cloud cover with no stars visible and thunder storm clouds with some variable amounts of sheet lighting.;37.2850787234043;-80.069629787234
