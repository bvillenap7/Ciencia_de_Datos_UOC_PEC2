Huge flash to right side of sky, then triangle object appeared after &quotsummoning&quot?? Please help;2016-01-09 22:00:00;15;Huge flash to right side of sky, then triangle object appeared after summoning??  Please help Okay, so I don't know how to explain this...  I heard a lot of things about summoning Ufos and I thought it was really stupid.  It was dark outside and all the stars were out so I went outside with my dog on the porch in my blanket.  I look into the sky and I pictured where I was at and asked them to come. I know it sounds crazy and nobody believes me, but it started with small orbs, chasing around and going across the sky, almost like stars? But then seething weird happened.  A HUGE blue light flashed really fast in the right side of the sky, right about he tree line (I live back in the country) and all of a sudden this thing just came above my house.  It had lights and they were in a triangle shape and they were blinking in a certain rhythm.  There were a lot of lights under it, I don't know how many.  But it was right above my house and I was so surprised and scared and my dog started barking at it and I ran inside, I was so overwhelmed, was crying and I didn't know what to do.  I don't know the exact date either.  I just found this sight to report it to.  Please help if you know what this was.  I've never heard of a blue flash before it coming before.
