When I came out of an antique store, I saw this bright light. It just kept getting bigger then, it dissapeared. No one I told believed me, except this one guy. There is no photo, video, or any sort of thing. It was nothing like on Earth. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));38.7627406504065;-77.2317772357725
Light shoots quickly across the sky.;2009-02-19 19:00:00;2 seconds;Light shoots quickly across the sky. At around 7, I was at a scout event taking place outside.  Then, randomly, there was this light shooting across the sky. I didn't think anything of it then.  But, afterwards, I realized it shot across the whole distance of the sky in about 2-3 seconds.  It had no noticeable shape, just some kind of light.  There was also a noise that sounded light a car passing by at a fair distance.;38.7627406504065;-77.2317772357725
Bright light seen moving across sky at impossible speed.;2015-02-05 21:30:00;4 seconds;Bright light seen moving across sky at impossible speed. i saw the bright light in the sky near the beltway heading south about a week ago and again yesterday.  this was unmistakeable i know how planes, helicopter, even shooting stars look.  this was a different brighter light that stayed in a fixed position in the sky and then moved at a constant impossible speed across the sky until it dissapeared.  lasted about 4 seconds. happened both times around 930pm;38.7627406504065;-77.2317772357725
Silent, moving light or shiny object observed in full daylight over Northern Virginia.  ((anonymous report));2018-07-08 11:50:00;10 seconds;Silent, moving light or shiny object observed in full daylight over Northern Virginia I live near a flight path for Washington Reagan National Airport (DCA).  I was in our backyard, and had just watched (and heard) a jet fly roughly overhead (NE) in its landing pattern towards DCA.  A minute or so later, I saw a bright light or shiny object moving in the opposite direction (SW).  It moved at roughly the same relative speed as the jet, given the jet was probably 2000-5000 feet above me.   I assumed this shiny object was also a plane, with the Sun reflecting off it, but it made no noise whatsoever.  As it moved away, it took on the appearance of two lights, but i can't vouch for that as I sometimes see slightly double at a distance.  The brightness, considering this was broad daylight and a completely cloudless sky, and the complete lack of noise were enough to make me think twice.   When it disappeared behind a tree, I got up and exited our backyard to the parking lot behind our house to get another look.  The trip took me three seconds, but when I to got the parking lot, the object was no longer visible. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
