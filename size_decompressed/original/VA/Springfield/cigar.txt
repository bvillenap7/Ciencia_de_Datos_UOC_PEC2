Metalic cigar shaped object sighted during lull in a storm in Springfield, VA;2010-10-10 16:30:00;15 secs;Metalic cigar shaped object sighted during lull in a storm in Springfield, VA During a lull in a storm I looked out through the blinds in my office to the east at an elevation of approximately 80 deg. to view the storm clouds.  Some sun and blue sky was appearing since the storm was winding down.   At that point I observed a cigar shaped object that at first looked like the fusilage of an airliner with a blue metallic tint, but no windows evident.   Further obervation failed to disclose wings or rotors, nor did I hear any sound whatsoever coming from this object.  It moved slowly to the southeast right into a cloud bank.   I continued to watch but it never reappeared.  Helicopters, airplanes and jets of all sorts frequent this area as this location is near several airports.  I can always hear the rotors or engines droning but this object made no sound.   It took me several days to completely comprehend what I had observed.   I am convinced that it was not any type of conventional aircraft. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.
