Two jellyfish shaped UFOs floating above skies of Springfield, VA.;2003-09-01 14:00:00;2 minutes;Two jellyfish shaped UFOs floating above skies of Springfield, VA. Late summer of 2003, one afternoon, my wife and I were traveling east on Franconia Springfield Parkway, Springfield, VA. Just pass the Springfield Metro (subway station) and at about 11:00 O'clock position, my wife noticed two strange cloud-like formations in the sky. She pointed these objects out to me and they were very noticeable, being that the sky was rather clear and blue. At first I thought they were hot air balloons but then I noticed that they were like vapor clouds, and somewhat thick in consistency since both were casting a shadow. The shape of these UFOs were identical to each other, their tops were circular in shape, as domes, and both had trails at their base, similar to tentacles from a jellyfish. They did not seem to move from their positions, static as they floated above. I do recall thinking that they may have been the results of an aircraft aerial backfires (if there is such a thing) spewing vaporous balls of smoky, oily residue. No sounds were emitted.
