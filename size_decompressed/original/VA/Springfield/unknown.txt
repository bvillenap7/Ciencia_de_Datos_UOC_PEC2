Large unknown object over Northern Virginia.;2001-03-23 20:50:00;3 minutes;Large unknown object over Northern Virginia. I'm writing to report a sighting of an unusual craft.  At about 8:40pm that Friday, I drove to a nearby gas station from my home to get a pack of cigarettes.  As I was driving back home I noticed a very large craft of some kind Flying relatively low in the sky.  It was about the size of an audio tape long wise at arms length.  I saw two lights at first thinking that is was two airplanes flying side by side in unison.  Then I realised it was one large object when I saw a small red light beside the far right light.  As the object went out of view behind some trees, I followed in my car for about a minute and caught a better look from the rear.  It was three lights in a line with the small red light just a bit lower to the right. As I watched the object trying to see if there was any discernable shape to it, I noticed that there was absolutely no noise coming from it.   I live in an area between Reagan National and Dulless International Airport and am familiar with the types of planes ad helecopters that fly in this area.  For any plane to have been that size in my field of view, it would have been making a recognizable deep rumble sound.  This object was higher up in the sky and was bigger that anything I have ever seen fly anywhere.  It seemed to glide though the sky heading south when it went out of view.  I was surprised that nobody else saw this in my area given its large population.  Whatever it was, I think it was intended for peolple to see it since it was so large and flying so low.;38.7627406504065;-77.2317772357725
Bright Pale Blue Flash - No Sound - Street Lights Went Out;2002-12-01 20:12:00;1/4 second;Bright Pale Blue Flash - No Sound - Street Lights Went Out We were driving west on Keene Mill Road, approaching the intersection with Greeley Boulevard in Springfield, VA.  At about 8:12 PM EST there was a bright pale blue flash which lit up the sky and area we were driving in.  Everything lit up, so we could not tell which direction (if any) the light came from.  It seemed to be either from above or that we were within the flash.  The street lights all went out, but power to homes remained on.  There was no sound.  The sky was clear, slight winds (maybe 5 mph) and the temperature was around 32 degrees F.  We continued driving towards home and when we got to another area of street lights, they were also out, but beginning to come back on.  This area was one mile southwest of the point where we saw the flash. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the event might have been caused by the explosion of one of the local transformers.  We have received several such reports.  PD));38.7627406504065;-77.2317772357725
