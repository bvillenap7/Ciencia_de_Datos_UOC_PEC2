Red Green lights on metal aircraft with aura around it viewed in Springfield VA.;2006-03-16 20:32:00;Letting my dog out to go ;Red Green lights on metal aircraft with aura around it viewed in Springfield VA. I was watching Thats So Raven, like usual and my mother asked me to let my dog out to do its buissness. It went out and looked in the sky for a shooting star, airplane, or UFO. I looked up at a large metal-looking object. OMG! It had clear beans of light coming out of it, two red and two green lights were on the ship, there was a white has around it. The hase looked like a cloud moving around it and moving with it. The object made a hwow noise about five times and slowly went away. A light beam went near me as I stepped into it. It did nothing to me. It was like a almost blinding spotlight. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));38.7627406504065;-77.2317772357725
Strange craft on Rolling Road next to military facilities.;2013-11-25 18:00:00;15;Strange craft on Rolling Road next to military facilities. I was driving on Rolling Road last night, granted its next to an army airport.  The shape of the craft was very unusual.  It was triangle shaped from the below profile with flashing lights and from the back it had a flat area almost like a scoreboard with 6-8 large flashing lights.  It hovered very low, 300 ft-500 ft, and then accelerated quietly over the tree line. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
