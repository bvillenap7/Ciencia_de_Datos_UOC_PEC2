4 horizontal orange lights seen over Fort Eustis.;2014-03-25 02:00:00;10 seconds;4 horizontal orange lights seen over Fort Eustis. My husband and I were getting home late, around 2am.  He got out of our car first and came over and opened my door.   As I was getting up, I looked up at the sky and saw 4 orange lights horizontal to each other.  As soon as I saw them the lights turned off and I could still see movement in the sky.  It happened very fast.   I turned to look at my husband and he asked if I saw it.  It was like the objects knew we saw them because it looked like the lights were turned off.;37.1592;-76.5935
