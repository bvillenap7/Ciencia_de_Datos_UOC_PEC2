US military built flying saucer's;2021-01-28 13:00:00;still in place;US military built flying saucer's The 2 crafts are both saucer shape and our government made them as I remember in or around 1957 and as I remember they did fly just well and  not as intended.  The time (1957) would be good if it was from information obtained from the Roswell, NM. crash.  I have view them several times from 1970 to 1992 (while in the service)and as of late also on line.  They are located at the US Army Transportation Museum at Fort Eustis, VA., but have very little back story about them. I have and do watch The UFO studies on Discovery and the History Channels and I have never seen any thing about the crafts that the US has built and they do in fact look like many that have been reported.  I do not know if the your group was aware of their exhibit or not.  If not I'm sure it would be worth a close look and see what your group thinks.;37.1592;-76.5935
