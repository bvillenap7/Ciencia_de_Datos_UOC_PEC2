It was the middle of the day with a clear sky, so it was easy to spot.   The object went behind the trees within about 5 seconds, but when I ran out down our driveway to get a better view, I could see it continuing to move in a straight line from West to East.  I have a flight radar app on my phone and when I checked it right afterward, there were no planes or helicoptors shown to be in the area.  It was very bizarre, to say the least. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Sure. It was June 10th (a Saturday) and it happened in the middle of the day.  ((END ADDENDUM));37.2157;-79.8079
