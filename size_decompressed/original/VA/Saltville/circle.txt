Huge Round Spherical LIght flew overtop my head  and then flew over the mountainrange;2008-05-22 21:20:00;30 seconds to 1 minute;Huge Round Spherical LIght flew overtop my head  and then flew over the mountainrange At 9:20 pm, I was outside on my deck fooling around with a sensor light on the side of my house, (close to the roof) all of a sudden i noticed straight overhead, a craft floating along.  I was amazed!!  The only thing visible was this round ball of light!  IF you held a penny at arms length above your head,...that was the size of this object!  It made no noise etc.  Just a solid white light.  IT wasn't the kind of light that flowed out on anything.  The only thing lit was the object. a solid pure white, very bright!  I watched this fly from overtop my head all the way until it passed over the mountain tops north-east from my house.  This object was i'd say halfway between the ground and the height a airliner would fly.  I don't know the footage that would be, sorry.  It wasn't moving very fast, just a smooth staight path.  It wasn't as fast as a jet nor was it slow as a hot air balloon. what ever it was, it had to have some sort of propulsion system.  After it wasn't visible any longer a airliner flew over head in the south east direction and it looked like a ant compared to a mouse!! this thing had to be huge!!!   As i watched this, I felt at peace and amazed as if i was seeing history in the making!  Ever since this sighting i have been obsessed in ufology. and have seen a few more things around where i live but nothing quite the size of this!!   Thank You for your time.;36.8958;-81.7396
