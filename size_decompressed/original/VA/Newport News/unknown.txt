odd moving object;2001-09-08 21:00:00;half an hour (maybe longe;odd moving object I first saw the object while sitting in a car it didn't move for quit awhile so I thought it could possibly be a radio tower or something then it began to move in a particular manner kinda like a zigzag but not exactly, then I got out of the car and turned around and it had moved a considerable distance and was a lot smaller than it first was. Then the other witnesses came out and I told them what I had seen and they too looked in the sky and saw it. It appeared to moving by then so we got in the car and drove not far from where we were and watched we saw other objects in the sky but they seemed to be planes and didn't have the same lights and light patterns that the object did. Then we drove to a marina to see if we couldn't get a better look and we could, it was far away by then but it was still noticeable we watched for about half an hour and it stood still for a long time then it would almost zigzag again and the stand still and then do it again and then go up and down quit always and then go back to its original position when we decided to leave it was in about the same spot it was when we first saw it at the marina. One was observed, there were red and whit lights flashing in an odd pattern, I couldn't really make out the shape.;37.0875836501901;-76.4958813688213
