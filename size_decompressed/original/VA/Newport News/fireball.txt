3 UFOs flying through the sky.;2015-02-24 02:30:00;10 seconds;3 UFOs flying through the sky. My husband and I went outside in my backyard before we went to bed looked up in the sky to see three orange lights flying through the sky in a straight line going at a very high speed.  From the ground they look to be about 3 feet apart they were there and then they were gone I stood outside to see if they would come back and they are nowhere to be found.  They all disappeared at the exact same spot about 3 seconds apart can anybody tell me what this is;37.0875836501901;-76.4958813688213
Multiple ballistic-like fireballs/rockets?;2017-04-15 20:30:00;30 minutes;Multiple ballistic-like fireballs/rockets? From 2130 until 2200, there were at least eight (8) instances of a bright fireball like object traveling across the sky.  From the approximate coordinates of (37.0923673,-76.4544147), near The Chesapeake living community in Newport News, VA, the object could be seen traveling in a somewhat ballistic trajectory.  Each object would originate from the south-southeast and travel north.  The objects were low on the horizon.  There would only be one object at a time, with a few minutes between each instance.  The objects seemed to be far  away, possibly over the Chesapeake bay.  The objects were very bright and constant, and did not have flashing lights like an airplane.  They looked very similar to rockets, similar to ones launched from Wallops Island.  No sound could be heard.  Other air traffic (planes, etc) would be seen flying but not typically when these object were seen.  The fireball was spherical in shape and bright orange/red.  I have a video of a few of ! them.  They all seemed to follow the same path.  I can also send the original (uncompressed) video files if possible. At about 14 seconds into the video:   https://goo.gl/photos/2hNrGd9ZBk7VtPKQ7   Most of this video has the object traveling right to left across the sky: https://goo.gl/photos/B6tovEx15obqjAfJ7   Can be seen at about 15 seconds:   https://goo.gl/photos/pj4mbqkCrVDTVJxw5   At about 52 seconds, the object can be seen in this video. I believe this was through an optic:  https://goo.gl/photos/ivg48NRx8DZXVTyu9;37.0875836501901;-76.4958813688213
