During a lightning storm we saw a bright light coming from the storm.  At first we thought it was a star but after a few seconds we realized it was moving.  So we believed it was a plane that was landing at the nearby airport.  But it kept moving even avoiding lightning bolts in the sky.   As it flew right past us we saw that it was shaped like a triangle. it had a single white light on it's right wing and and it had a flashing red light in the center.  We lost sight of it after it flew behind trees.;37.0875836501901;-76.4958813688213
Triangular shaped craft with lights on each point hovering in Newport News near Chestnut Avenue and Aberdeen Roadthen shot up and disap;2015-07-21 22:23:00;20 minutes;Triangular shaped craft, with lights on each point, hovering in Newport News near Chestnut Avenue and Aberdeen Road, then shot up and disappeared. I just cam out the Newport News tunnel headed into Hampton, I noticed a craft in  sky but it wasn't moving.  I asked my wife to take a look at it because I couldn't identify it.  She couldn't, either.   As we got closer we could see the shape of a triangle.  This craft had a light on each of the conners.  No airplane is stationary in the sky helicopter is as big or shaped this way, there were no blinking lights at all.   I live less than a mile from an airport I know what airplanes, jets, and helicopters look like at night, this thing was none of those.   I lost sight of it when I shot straight up in the air disappearing completely. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

HUGE BLACK TRIANGLE CRAFT WITH 3 LIGHTS IN VIRGINA.;2017-04-05 05:10:00;10 seconds;HUGE BLACK TRIANGLE CRAFT WITH 3 LIGHTS IN VIRGINA. April 5th, 2017, around 5:10 AM, I was outside our shop at Newport News shipyard, taking a break and talking with a few coworkers, when I noticed something in the sky right above my head, about 250-350 feet.  I had just enough time to be able to point and say, What is that? and my other two coworkers were able to catch a glimpse of it before it disappeared behind a building.  I ran to the other side of the building, which only took me about 10 seconds to get there, to see if I could see it, and it had disappeared.  It was heading northeast just west of Langley Air Force Base. It was a clear night.  We didn’t hear any sounds before or after spotting the aircraft.  It was a solid black triangle (all sides were the same size, a perfect acute angle) the size of a football field with a light in each corner of the craft.  The lights were pulsating very fast almost like an energy surge.  The best way to describe the lights would be comparable to halo lights, but soft white in color.  The lights seemed to be what powered the craft. None of us could identify it to anything we've seen before like a drone, or military plane.  I grew up around the air force base and I've seen a lot of night flight drills, and have never seen anything like this before.;37.0875836501901;-76.4958813688213
Large triangle UFO with lights practically landed on a neighbors house.

It was so low you thought you could touch it with a ladder At around 7:30 PM in the year 2017 I had gotten together with a family friend to talk to her about life and a personal situation. Right when she came to pick me up and take her to her place I thought I had saw something. I lived near Denbigh when this occurred and so I see this light, and typically planes fly in, in the area so it isn’t uncommon. However, what made me want to go check it out was how low the lights were and how big they were too. It was like a big circular blob of light above a house that was just sitting there. So - being a science geek who loves the weather and studying stars and meteors I thought: “Okay, let’s go check this out! I wanna know if there’s a meteor or some rocket launch that I don’t know about over there!”  So we drive down the street at a low speed of 15-20mph and then we get to the school across from this. That’s when she tells me, “It’s not a star! It’s some plane!” We started to freak out at that point because it was so low like it was on top of trees and it wasn’t moving so right when we pulled up it started to move and I took note of every detail because I was so eager to take a picture that I dropped my phone.  Triangular like shape, black, round belly with 3 white lights going in a straight line, white lights forming a triangle, tiny red lights in between - too many lights to be a plane. Turned all of its lights off when we chased it and disappeared. Has been bothering us ever since! Please don’t discredit this information: I live in a military affiliated area - very heavily - and I really thought it was strange how low it was flying, the fact that there weren’t any jets getting it. It practically landed on top of a house, and from the side it was about 2 houses long - almost like it could be a house. There weren’t any wings on it. Chased it all the way to Warwick before it disappeared because it KNEW we were chasing it  When we tried to turn after seeing it the car stalled out which wasn’t normal either because the car was new;37.0875836501901;-76.4958813688213
