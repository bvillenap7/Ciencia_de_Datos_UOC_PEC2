I looked up and saw a very shiny chrome colored cylinder shaped object, maybe as long as an 18 wheeler, a couple hundred feet above the trees, it was a sunny clear day. It wasn’t in a real hurry, just going at a steady pace. I saw some kind of a red square or something on the side, at the front with some kind of thing sticking out like a flagpole or something rotating so fast it was blurred. Though it made no sound,  I thought the craft might be a drone or something, it was heading right towards NASA in Hampton Virginia, which is a straight shot from my backyard 15 minutes away by car,. I ran back into the office and told my husband,  he was standing right in there, to come out and look ...he looked at me like I was crazy for a second but then he came right out by that time he saw it from the back, but he definately saw it. I’ve been looking up different aircraft, trying to find something like it ever since and I can’t find anything.;37.0875836501901;-76.4958813688213
