Approacing with the ultimate in techonoligal stealth , liken unto a Chamelon!;1993-06-15 13:30:00;5mins;Approacing with the ultimate in techonoligal stealth , liken unto a Chamelon! The date is approximate and my best guess. Didn't really ever want to tell anyone. After leaving my friends house and proceeding down the driveway, I heard the crows in the tops of the tall pines raising heck. I turned to look because the noise was like that of/or if 1 of their own was wounded. While watching them in the tops of the trees fling around squalking wildly, with a clear blue sky in the farthest background, I noticed a round blue circular object coming into view underneath the high cirrus clouds. Immediately I was overwhelmed as it came closer and to my dismay, began to project the clouds over top of the craft on the bottom. It was easy to follow while moving down the peninsula with the constant movement of the clouds in the path of the craft being seemingly plucked from the sky and projected on the underside of the craft. The craft only stopped two times while traveling down the peninsula, once over apparently Ft.Eustis, the second being apparently over ths James River bridge area, before uplifting at an incredible pace and dissapearing above the high cirrus clouds. The two times the craft stopped it was extremely hard to see. 1 point that I called frantically for my friend or his 2star Admiral father to come see what i was looking at, i looked away for a second while it was stationary, only to have a hard time seeing it again when i looked back. While still stationary, the craft seemed to have a sheen of a very thin line of colors of the surroundings given at it's outermost edges. But when it started to move again, it resumed picking up what was above the craft and projecting it below on it's hull. There was no noise from it the whole time, however the crows stopped squalkin when the craft was stopped almost overhead. Weird hugh? The approximate time for this whole ordeal was about 5 mins. The approximate path viewed was form the Colonial Williamsburg - Camp Peary area down to the first stop over the Warwickriver - Ft.Eustis area then down to the James River bridge - Newport News shipyard area. When leaving upwards and outwards the craft seemed to go towards Chesapeake - Soffolk direction. I have wondered over the years if they had the techonology to project what was above to below, what a perfect camoflauge if the could project below to the above so as not to be spotted if overflown. We'll to sum it up whatever or whoever they were they made me wonder how small we really are. Still, with my faith in Christianity, I guess one day, God will let me know!

Single orb starts in the sky, then becomes encircled by other orbs, then spins away.;2002-07-01 23:00:00;00:00:15;Single orb starts in the sky, then becomes encircled by other orbs, then spins away. I only got a few seconds glimpse when I was young. But I clearly remember being in my car at night when it was nearly pitch black.  Then a light appeared in the sky, I think it was blue or green, and it was only about 20 feet above the houses.  Then about 4 seconds after the first light appeared a bunch of other lights, at least more than 10, came up around the first light encircling it.  Then the UFO hoved over the houses for a few seconds longer, then spun for a second and spun away.  I am not completely sure, but I think the lights might have been changing color as they were spinning. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
