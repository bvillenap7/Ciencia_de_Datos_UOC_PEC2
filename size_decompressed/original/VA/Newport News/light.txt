I took my dog out to the back yard to do his business prior to putting him up for the night.  I was admiring the stars when one star got my attention.  It seemed to be moving. It was very high up – higher than any airplane that flies over my house. It was not in the normal flight path of the aircraft that fly over my house.  I was watching this “star” and then all of a sudden the light went out.  I could still see a non-blinking faint red light as the object transited the sky.  I was able to follow it until it disappeared behind a bank of clouds. It was very hard to see but the red light was visible. The location in the sky: it was in the north just west of the dipper that is directly over my house this time of year.  It moved from north to southwest.  From my unaided sight perspective it was about 12 inches west of the handle of the dipper.  I could hear no sort of engine noise because it was so high up.;37.0875836501901;-76.4958813688213
Bright red light scanning across my house and patio area.;2012-02-13 00:00:00;30 seconds;Bright red light scanning across my house and patio area. While letting my dog out around midnight to use the bathroom. I stood at the back door watching her.  All a sudden I saw a bright red light coming from the front of the house and covered the whole patio area.  It moved across the patio toward the back of the yard.  My dog saw it to and took off running to the door.  I quickly closed the back door.  I did not look back outside as it had scared me to much.;37.0875836501901;-76.4958813688213

She saw a light in the night sky.  The light appeared to be a slow moving plane.  I looked at it upon her inquiry.  We both then noticed several red/orange lights.  They all appeared to be traveling same direction yet not following one another.   There was also one larger white light among the group.  We could not hear any noise or photograph with with phone (resolution was to low). we observed the lights moving in the night sky for roughly 3 minutes.  They slowly and silently moved across the dark night sky (sky was darker due to distant cloud cover).  The lights slowly faded as they passed.;37.0875836501901;-76.4958813688213
10 lights flying in formation behind an airplane;2013-08-02 21:00:00;3:00;10 lights flying in formation behind an airplane Around 21:00 when it was just getting dark, my girlfriend said, What the heck?! and I looked up and saw 10 lights in the sky in an odd formation.  They seemed to be following a normal airplane at first, but the plane flew off.  They were pretty high up there, and flew slowly but consistently, moving southward for about 3 minutes until they just kind of disappeared into the horizon.  The 10 lights looked almost the size of a plane in the distance, but they were dimly lit, and the light being emitted did not look like that of a plane.  There were no visible blinking lights on the sides like a normal airplane.  They would not show up on my cell camera, but the normal airplane did.  My girlfriend compared them to little candles floating.  Another neighbor parked and got out of car trying to take pictures.  She also had no idea what they could be.  I have lived here all my life and never seen anything like this.;37.0875836501901;-76.4958813688213

I estimate the distance between the two lights to be approximately 150 feet. After two minutes of observing, the lights simply vanished from view.;37.0875836501901;-76.4958813688213
