Hexagon shape ufo's;1980-12-10 00:00:00;1 minute;Hexagon shape ufo's I was on guard duty with a nother person around 12:00am. I felt something over my head.  I look up and around 20 feet off the ground I saw three space craft with a shape of a hexagon hovering over our heads.  Their was no noise and the ufo were just floating.They had no window and signs and they were the size of a bus and no more than 6 feet tall. Then with in one min they shot ahead about 100 yards and then went up as fast as light can move. Their was no wind or any type of drag.   I am so lucky to have seen this.

Star flashing red, green and amber;2001-11-01 18:00:00;continuous;Star flashing red, green and amber Every clear night since about 11-01-01, I have seen this star rise underneath the constellation Casseopia (about 30 degrees under and slightly west of it).  I am a am a nightly sky watcher and I suddenly noticed this new star which caught my eye due to the bright magnitude. It's brighter than any nearby stars in that part of the sky.  It is white and something about it just looks different, it appears to me to be slightly flashing but totally white.  When I look through the binoculars, I am definitely seeing 3 colors flashing: green, red and amber.  It rises like a star throughout the evening as if it's moving with the earths rotation.  I look through the binoculars at other objects that I know to be stars to see if maybe I am getting the colors through some kind of distortion but the other stars are all white.  One evening, there was 2 of the objects about the same height in the sky and about 30 degrees between them. Also, always in conjunction with this star rising, I see lots of little white flashes flickering here and there in the vicinity of the star.  One night, there were 8 flashes that all went off pretty much simultaneously, like flashbulbs popping but not with that amount of brightness,  and it was almost like they were communicating.  One other interesting point, I looked up in my star maps and there is no star of that magnitude located underneath Casseopia.  I know stars twinkle but they don't change colors.  I don't know what to make of this and think that I can't be the only person seeing this.  Hopefully, someone else will write in and confirm my sighting.

1 slowly moving aircraft gliding through tree line.  When in full sight it had lights rotating around in a circle one being red.;2016-08-29 23:00:00;10 minutes;1 slowly moving aircraft gliding through tree line.  When in full sight it had lights rotating around in a circle one being red.  Other colors to my belief were green and white, I am color blind sadly.   It made no sound but hovered and slowly made its way out of sight on the ground.   It's normal to hear an owl in my back yard but we heard at least 5 or 6 owls in different directions, also an unusual bird sound was heard.;37.0875836501901;-76.4958813688213
