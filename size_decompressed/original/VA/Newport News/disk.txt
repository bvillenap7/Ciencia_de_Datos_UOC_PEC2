I could see directly into the craft because lights were ON inside.;1980-12-01 21:00:00;1 minute;At approx.10p.m.I went for a walk in my neighborhood(street lights,houses,& very safe??)about 150yds.from home,I looked into a culd-e-sac and  silently hovering 10ft. above a house within this culd-e-sac: was a saucer 25ft.long with spinning(faster then my eyes could follow) multicolored lights on the bottom of it.And a luminous whitish light all around it.It had a round window 2ft.by2ft.in the middle.I could see directly into the craft because lights were ON inside.It appeared as if their were round  black dials on the far wall?? but I was approx.300ft.away. At first I rubbed my eyes.I then turned away ,shook my head, and it was still there. But what unnerved me the MOST was it seemed to be aware of my presense.My curiosity quickly turned to fear and disbelief.I ran as fast as I could to get a neighbor/witness ,but my friend got mad & thought I was joking.We returned 10min. later and it was gone...27yrs. later, and this incident still unnerves me..I dont think or talk about it.. because people just laughed at me then.But its one minute of terror I will never forget.

Fast glowing disc through the early morning sky.;2001-12-16 10:30:00;15 min.;Fast glowing disc through the early morning sky. My dog noticed it first, he was looking up at the sky and backing up, so I looked up there was a disc shaped object zig-zagging across the sky from East to West, so I yelled for my boyfriend.  My boyfriend said it looked like a glowing football, I thought it looked like a disc.  I was very fast and it seemed like it was producing it's own light.  It made no sound and left no trail of itself being there.  The sky had a few cirrus clouds, the majority of the sky was clear.  There was only one and I could see it until it met the the line of trees that border the horizon, it continued to glow the entire time.;37.0875836501901;-76.4958813688213
Green-Ringed Saucer 14 feet away;2008-01-24 21:05:00;1 minute, 30 seconds;Green-Ringed Saucer 14 feet away We were at a firework display, my eye followed a firework and led to this thick, giant disk-like saucer...it was very eerie and I somehow couldn't look away. I told the people with me but they hadn't seen it. The obhect was neon-green ringed and had a slowly spiraling pattern on it.  It was an incredible 14 feet away from me, I was startled, as it caught my gaze it moved incredibly slowly over me, something bugged my eye so I rubbed it, looked back up and it was no where to be seen.  I felt somehow trapped staring at this disk-like object...I had never seen anything as eerie as that before.  I looked around before consulting my friends to see if anyone else was startled, only a few amount of people were talking and gesturing toward the sky where I had seen it.  As it caught my gaze, I felt as if nothing else was going on around me...all noise was drowned out.  This is no fake report, I don't waste my time with things like that, what I saw baffles me even now.  I hope that you can give me some sort of logical explanation...the craft made no sound, no quick movements, no anything!;37.0875836501901;-76.4958813688213
saucer shaped craft at extreme close distance;2008-02-14 13:00:00;30sec;saucer shaped craft at extreme close distance My wife and I witnessed a saucer shaped craft at an extremely close distance,about 70 yards,on our way to pay a bill off of Jefferson ave in Newport news Va. The object was around 25 to 30 ft long and standing at perfect stationary position over tree's.I remember saying what the hell and turning to see if my wife had seen the object, she said nothing but looked at me, on the way out from paying the bill, we started talking about what we had seen. We decided not to tell anyone about the incident.We are not ufo type people or sci fi type people. I don't know what made me decide to send this email tonight, its kinda driving me crazy thinking about this.  thanks S.McDaniel ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Small seemingly round object with red lights that streaked from the north horizon to the south horizon in a matter of 1 to 2 seconds;2019-12-23 16:25:00;30 seconds;Small seemingly round object with red lights that streaked from the north horizon to the south horizon in a matter of 1 to 2 seconds On the evening of December 23rd, 2019, right before sunset around 1625 my husband and I were standing outside when he looked up and noticed a small object in the north horizon hovering in the distance.  We stood watching it for about 10 seconds or more and the object continue to hover NOT moving up or down or side-to-side.  It seemed to be round  and had multiple red lights that flashed.  Suddenly it shot across the sky in a straight line from the north to south along the horizon in a matter of 1 to 2 seconds making no sound whatsoever.  It then stopped and hovered in the southern horizon for about 5 more seconds and disappeared.  It definitely was not a plane and we tried to compare it to maybe a helicopter but there is NO WAY that even a helicopter could have moved that fast!  All our life  we have lived  in this area that has an Army, Navy and Air Force bases near by and see multiple types of aircrafts constantly.  But we have NEVER seen anything that even comes close to what we saw that night!!;37.0875836501901;-76.4958813688213
