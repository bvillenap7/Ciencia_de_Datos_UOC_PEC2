Bright orange spherical object moving very quickly from SW to NE in steady, soundless flight.;2008-02-02 21:50:00;1 min 30 sec.;Newport News, VA -- Saw tonight (2-02-08) at about 9:50 p.m. bright orange spherical object moving very quickly from SW to NE in steady, soundless flight.  Much brighter and larger looking than brightest stars.  As it approached my position on my well-lit street (was walking dog), first thought was witnessing meteorite, but its luminosity did not waver except in a minute, slightly irregular way, and the complete lack of trail suggested not meteorite.   Continued directly overhead more quickly than any jet (Langley Air Force base gives us daily F-22 overflights).  No flashing lights -- orange light from single source, not several as would be seen on aircraft  no strobes.   Flew straight and steady into distance.  Total visibility time approximately one minute or slightly more.  ISS flyover shown to be 6:30 p.m. earlier in the evening according to NASA website, so this is ruled out.
