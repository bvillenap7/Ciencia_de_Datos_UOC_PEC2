Bright pinhead flash that grew in size to basketball size and changed colors from white to gaseous green.;2001-09-07 20:45:00;5 seconds;Bright pinhead flash that grew in size to basketball size and changed colors from white to gaseous green. I was outside UFO watching while talking on the phone to my friend in NY (the same friend I saw UFO with on 9/3/01) and looking up at the sky.  Alot of stars out, moon hadn't risen yet so was getting very dark.  While I was listening to her, all of a sudden at about 60 degrees up, I saw this bright white light.  At first I thought it was a plane that was close (because of the brilliance) but the white light kept growing to about the size of a baseball.  It grew some more but then turned bright gaseous looking green color and swelled up to the size of a basketball at arms length.  As I was looking and trying to comprehend what I was seeing, I had an awful feeling that I was watching an atom bomb explode or something, just seeing it grow like it did.  All at once, the green light died out and flickered a few times and I THINK I saw a tiny white light in it's place that all of a sudden looked like a star.  I was alone and freaked out so that was it for my UFO watching last night.  I have only seen something like this once before and that was when a rocket was sent up from nearby Wallops Island, VA that was conducting some kind of chemical test.  Barring Wallops Island having sent a rocket up last night, this was definitely something I have never seen before.  At least two other aircraft on normal local flight paths were seen right after this flare up.;37.0875836501901;-76.4958813688213
