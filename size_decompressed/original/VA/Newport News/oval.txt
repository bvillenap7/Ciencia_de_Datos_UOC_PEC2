oval shaped object with an orange glow;2013-07-18 20:30:00;45 seconds;Around dusk myself and a group of friends (4) saw an oval shaped object with an orange glow moving across the sky to the left.   It was moving faster than an airplane or jet and it was too far up in elevation to be one.   It passed under the moon and looked like it was just right underneath it.   It lasted about 45 seconds and in the blink of an eye it vanished in thin air.;37.0875836501901;-76.4958813688213
Ball of light with a spike in southwest sky that arcs westerly to the horizon.;2013-10-29 19:00:00;1 hour;ball of light with a spike in southwest sky that arcs westerly to the horizon. It is around Dusk, approximately 1900, and I am taking my dog out.  From my backyard I look up towards the Southwest direction (about 260 or 265 degrees)  Above the trees is a ball of light with an orange spike. I look at it with my binoculars but it still just looks like a ball of light with an orange spike.  My binoculars are not very strong.   On Friday, 25 Oct 13, I see the same light with spike and I have another person with me and he sees the same thing I see, but just dismisses it as “Venus”.  I would also but this light is sporadic.  It was there Friday, 25 Oct 13, but was not there on 26 or 27 Oct 13.  It was on 28 and 29 Oct 13. I have been seeing this ball of light off and on for about 2 or 3 months.  It has been seen in the same area each time except for 28 and 29 Oct 13.  It has moved more southerly (about 255 degrees). It starts out each night just above the trees and then arcs westerly until it disappears below the horizon. It takes about an hour or so for it to arc and go below the horizon.  The movement is much faster than any of the stars in the sky. When I say above the trees I mean that it is about 40 degrees from the ground.  Without a more powerful scope I cannot get a greater amount of detail. I attempted to take photos but my camera just recorded, on full zoom, a far distant light with on detail.;37.0875836501901;-76.4958813688213
