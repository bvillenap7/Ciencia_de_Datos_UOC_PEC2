Matellic Object Seen In Gainsville Virginia;2008-10-19 11:00:00;3 minutes;Matellic Object Seen In Gainsville Virginia Hello, I saw this object as I walked outside into my back yard at about 11:00 am. A bright flash caught my attention in the northern sky. At first sight I assumed I was seeing an airplane. I quickly noticed this wasn't a airplane but a short stubby metallic object. This object is hard to describe, please see accompanied photos for a better explanation. The object moved at normal speed and seemed to just silently glide from the north east to south west toward the Bull Run Mountains. This object could have been a aircraft unknown to me so please see the photos to make your own assumption. I did not take these photographs. I found these when researching the object I saw. The photos where taken on interstate 95 south while the witness was stuck in traffic. He had seen this object stationary and then something smaller flew into it. The pictures shows exactly the object I saw and it was on the same day. It has to be the same object. Thank You.;38.8184000000001;-77.6202000000001
