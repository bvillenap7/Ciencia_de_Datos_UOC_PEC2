Greenlight falling from sky over Haymarket, Virginia area.;2008-05-13 11:28:00;10 seconds;Greenlight falling from sky over Haymarket, Virginia area. This event occured Tuesday evening as I was driving back to my home located in Gainesville, VA. I was heading in the North Western direction at the time, and out of the left corner of my I saw a strange greenish tint object falling towards the ground out of the sky looked to be a few miles away. It looked to be falling somewhere over the haymarket, possibly a bit north west from that area. The angle in which it was falling I would have to say was between a 20-30degree decline. I would have to guess the actual light appeared very low in the atmosphere and seemed to definitely falling within this imediate area. It was a greenish yellow maybe a little red or blue around the outside. The movement wasnt seen for 5-10 seconds.;38.8184000000001;-77.6202000000001

The object was bright and was flashing red and green lights along with an almost L.E.D. white light. These lights were clearly visible to all three of us using just our eyes and later confirmed with binoculars and telescope. The object almost appeared to be rotating at high speeds which could explain to alternation of lights which had no apparent pattern. This object was relatively fixed in the same portion of the night sky compared to other celestial objects. The object would move in irrative movements, suddenly going to the left and right really fast and then in circular movements. Then, it stopped moving and the green and red lights settled down. I flashed a bright HID light at it in sequences of 3. It was like the object was reacting to my flashes by beginning to move again and flashing back once again. I couldn't believe what I was! seeing and neither could my astronomy buddies, we were all stunned. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
