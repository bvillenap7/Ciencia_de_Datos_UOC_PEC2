I am a Meteorologist and amateur astronomer with many years of trained observation of the day and night time sky. I've added the 11:00am-2:00pm hourly weather report for the day the sighting occurred (1:00pm) and the Astronomical data for December 14 2008.  1:52 PM, Sun 14 December 2008  47° 28°  48%  30.45in 10mi 25000ft S13mph  0mph Broken Clouds  12:52 PM, Sun 14 December 2008  46° 27°  47%  30.45in 10mi 25000ft S13mph  0mph Broken Clouds  11:52 AM, Sun 14 December 2008  45° 25°  46%  30.5in 10mi 25000ft S17mph  24mph Broken Clouds  10:52 AM, Sun 14 December 2008  42° 28°  58%  30.53in 10mi 12000ft S13mph  0mph Broken Clouds  Astronomical Data for December 14, 2008: Rise:  Set:     Actual Time:  7:19 AM EST  4:47 PM EST Civil Twilight:  6:49 AM EST  5:17 PM EST Nautical Twilight:  6:15 AM EST  5:50 PM EST Astronomical Twilight:  5:43 AM EST  6:22 PM EST Moon:  7:08 PM EST (12/14)  9:22 AM EST (12/14)   Length Of Visible Light:  10h 27m Length of Day:  9h 28m      Waning Gibbous, 94% Moon Illumination  Sighting Report: I set out to walk my dog just as the 1:00 football games were beginning. As I walked into my backyard I was looking at the long contrails extending north to south across the deep blue sky. I soon noticed a lower flying aircraft flying from the northeast to the southwest. As I watched the aircraft I soon noticed a small white object following close behind it. Stunned at first, I starred at the object trying to figure out what this object could be. After a few seconds of observation I noticed the object was white in color and disk or orb like in appearance. While I watched the white disk it started swinging back and forth behind the airplane in a left to right type fashion. I wondered at first if I was seeing a big white bird, I quickly realized this was definitely not the case. As I watched the object swing left to right it all a sudden dove or dropped straight down and flew underneath the airplane for a few seconds, it then swung just under the plane to the left side and amazingly completely circled the airplane and then again trailed behind it. I was absolutely amazed at what I was seeing, it was at this point I thought to myself, do I have time to run inside and grab my camera. I hesitated at first thinking the object would be gone by the time I got back. Than I thought, I have to try because know one will believe me if I don't get a picture-so off I went running. I grabbed the camera, ran back outside and was just able to take a short video as the object disappeared over Haymarket toward the Bull Run mountains. I have tried to consider other explanations for this object but have been mostly unable to do so. The only possibility could be a in flight refuel for the air combats that are deployed to protect Washington DC airspace. I don't think this is much of a possibility since the aircraft the object was following was not military but a passenger plane. The white disk I saw was also not a conventional military aircraft. There wasn't any wings visible on the craft and the craft was more disk/orb like in appearance. I wanted to report this sighting to you in hopes that someone else in my area may have also seen this remarkable ariel display. I Thank You.;38.8184000000001;-77.6202000000001
