UFO parked on trail road at night.;1976-01-15 20:00:00;2 minutes;UFO parked on trail road at night. My dad and uncle were calling coyotes one night and drove up a trail road with their lights off, about 15 miles West of Imperial, thinking to park there to start calling for coyotes.  They were driving slowly towards the East when all of a sudden a craft directly in front of their pickup lit up with many lights on the bottom, and rose straight up from the ground in front of them and proceeded to head due East towards the town of Imperial.  My dad had exclaimed to my uncle, What the heck was that, and my uncle never spoke a word, nor did he tell his wife about it, nor did he ever speak of it.  I asked my dad if he had any missing time, and he wasn't sure! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));40.5274;-101.657
