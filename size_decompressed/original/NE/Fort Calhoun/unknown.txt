multi colored stationary objects viewed from Fort Calhoun NE on Sept. 26, 2009 at approximately 2200 - 2230;2009-09-26 22:00:00;ongoing;multi colored stationary objects viewed from Fort Calhoun NE on Sept. 26, 2009 at approximately 2200 - 2230 The object is currently sitting say 55 degrees off the NWN horizon.  Use the last star in the handle of the big dipper and go down at an angle.  The 'star???' appears to have many colors, blue, green, yellow, red, pink. The second anomolie is in the NEN sky about 60 degrees off the horizon just below the constellation Cassiopeia.  This anomolie also has the colors red, green, yellow blue & pink. I did take a few pictures, before my camera started to get fickle.  I am not an astral photograher nor am I versed in night photography so these appear as blurry dots, or trails of multi-colored lights. This is the second time I've seen this.;41.4387;-96.0374
