Flying object with circle pattern of lights changing to a V pattern of lights;2002-02-24 21:00:00;10 minutes;flying object with circle pattern of lights changing to a V pattern of lights I wish i had pictures or a video.  When I was in high school, my best friend and I were driving around on country roads in rural nebraska (we didn't have much to do)  There wasn't a cloud in the cool night sky.  Something caught our eye... it was a bright light in the sky.  We couldn't tell what it was, but we decided it wasn't a star and it wasn't a plane so I drove closer to it.  As we got closer the light became brighter and more visible.  The light became clearer as we got closer.  The light was actually 6-8 lights in a very precise circle pattern hovering in the sky.  We estimated it was no more than a few hundred feet in the air.  At our closest point we stopped the car to get out and look, shut off our headlights so we wouldn't be noticed.  No more than a few seconds after we got out of the car the lights moved very smoothly and took only about 4 seconds or so turn into a V pattern.  Once it was in the V the object flew west so fast... it was out ! of our sights in less than 20 seconds.  Really spooked us but nothing had become of it even though I watched the news for similar sightings but apparently no one else saw it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD));41.1221;-98.0018
