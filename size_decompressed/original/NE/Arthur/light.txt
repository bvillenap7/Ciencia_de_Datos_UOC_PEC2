Very bright light 4x size of Mars.;2003-10-08 19:05:00;25 seconds;Very bright light 4x size of Mars. I was returning to my house after having shut chicken house up for the night when i saw this large (approx. 4x the size of Mars) bright steady light moving south easterly from the north and as it neared the proximity of the full moon, it faded from sight. I'm guessing I observed it for approximately 20-25 seconds as I stood still and watched to see if it became visable again. It didn't. I returned to the house to write down the sighting and went back outside to observe the moon and Mars as it's a gorgeous quiet night. The object was approximately 25-30 degrees from the eastern horizon.;41.5775;-101.6948
Intense white light remains stationary on the western horizon.;2021-02-16 02:08:00;Ongoing;Intense white light remains stationary on the western horizon. Really quite brilliant, looking toward the west, at some distance on the horizon, a bright light below the cloud cover... twenty degrees, or so, above the horizon. Standing in my driveway, just off the porch, and, as I say, looking west, there remains a singular, stationary, light, which is quite large. My thumb, at arm’s length, doesn’t cover it. The illumination similar to an arc light, or a welder’s torch. According to the National Weather Service, visibility is 7 miles, wind from the SE at 9 mph, temperature 10 degrees below zero, with a wind chill at 19 degrees below zero, and skies are mostly cloudy.;41.5775;-101.6948
