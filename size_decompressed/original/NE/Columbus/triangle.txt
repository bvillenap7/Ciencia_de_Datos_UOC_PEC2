Triangular craft seen by three females.;2000-01-20 22:00:00;5-8min;Triangular craft seen by three females. I was driving in a vehicle with two of my friends both female.  I was riding in the passenger seat.  While looking out my window I noticed a blinking object moving very fast towasrds us.  We were on gravel roads outside town near a gas station called Lakw Stop.  My friend decided to pull over in the station and we all got out.  By that time the object was directly over us and was only about 200 ft. up.  It made no sound but the bottom was lit with alternating red, oarnge, and white lights.  I then began to get hystericle and told my friends to get back in the car.  We spend to town and the aircraft followed us about a mile away and then disappeared.;41.4294000000002;-97.3680999999998
