My wife called for me to come to the backyard and look up in the sky... I came outside and look up and their were these round objects that were really shinny and moving really fast.  I was freaking out and ran back into the house for the camera.  I ran back out to look for one and didn't see them anymore then minute later two more flew over the house.  I would say these things were flying about 10,000 feet maybe.  We have a small airport near by and these objects didn't fly any higher then these smaller aircraft.  All I can say is WoW, plus my wife is so anti this kind of stuff I thought is was funny she saw the first two and called for me to look.  Crazy!;41.4294000000002;-97.3680999999998
