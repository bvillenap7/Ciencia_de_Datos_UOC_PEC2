I saw a bight light that appeared to follow me from south Omaha to west Omaha on Satruday 9/22/2012;2012-09-22 06:30:00;30 minutes;I saw a bight light that appeared to follow me from south Omaha to west Omaha on Satruday 9/22/2012 9/22/2012 6:30 am – 6:50 am  I was leaving my house in south Omaha to go to work on Saturday morning. It was exactly 6:30 am on the clock in my car.   I noticed a very, very bright night kind of hovering over the sky above the house.   In perspective, it looked like it was right over the point in the attic of the house.   So I back up and as I back up, this light goes straight up vertically right over the house, moving higher into the sky.   I noticed….and stopped... When I stopped, it stopped.   Then I put the car back in drive and moved back into the driveway, the light followed and dropped back down, moving closer.   I did it again and the light followed each time. Then I started thinking, maybe it is a police helicopter of something.  So I back out again and pulled out as I normally do, still seeing this light moving with me.   I went to the end of the drive and began to pull out on to the street.  Curiousity had a hold of me at this point so I put the car in park and got out again.   The light had moved over horizontally again as if it was following me. I noticed the time was now 6:50 am, which seemed was crazy,  time just flew, I did not realize I had spent so much time watching this bright light. So I get back in the car, and drive away.    I drove 2 blocks over and 4 blocks up which took me to the stop sign at 23rd and F street.   I  put the car in park again and got out to see if I could see the light.   It was there, right above the street ,  definitely following me.   I wasn’t afraid or anything, I just kept thinking, what the heck is this. So I was getting back in the car and I saw a man going to his car….I kind of waved to him and I asked him if he could see this light…he kept saying no, but there is no way anyone could miss this light.   I told him to  follow the tree  line and look again.  He said no and got in his car. So I got back in my car and proceeded to work.   I work off of 120th and Maple.   When I got to work, I glanced up quickly to see if I see anything and I did not. So a few minutes later, a coworker arrived, she had picked up breakfast and her hands were full, so I went to the door to help her gather her things.   The light was there. I asked her if she could see it and she did.  She said she thought it was a black hawk helicopter  and did not seem too impressed, but by now, it was lighter outside and it did not look as spectacular  and of course she did not see it move across the sky as I did. I have no clue what this was but I asked it to make us treat each other well and the take care of the world better……………..oh and I also asked it to make me rich and skinny….just in case it was something out of the ordinary and could hear me.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237
Silver, cylindrical object seen over Omaha skies.;2013-10-02 13:55:00;Unknown;Silver, cylindrical object seen over Omaha skies I saw a cylindrical object over the western portion of Omaha, NE on Tuesday, October 2, 2013 at approximately 13:55 hours.  It was silver in color, looked to be shaped like a cylinder and hovered in the sky for about two minutes or so and then it disappeared.  It looked like it was a large object, even though it was probably 5-6 miles away.  I can't say how long it was actually there since I didn't notice it until I was driving on Dodge Street heading west back to my office.  It could have been there for a much longer time.  But it was definitely there and then gone.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237
