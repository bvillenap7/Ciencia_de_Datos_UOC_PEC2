Something made us both lean forward and to look through the top of the winshield at the same time.  It was as if a door opened in the night sky, rectangular in shape.  The light coming from the door appeared to be white.  Out of the door dropped an orange beam of light that did not touch the ground.  Distance could not be determined, but it appeared to be overhead at a high altitude.  Don't remember how it disappeared, but remember we both leaned back in our seats at the same time and we were still driving on I-80.  Don't know how much time elapsed between first sighting and our leaning back and resuming the trip.  To me, the experience was not frightening, but the driver of the car became very aggitated and said he never wanted to discuss what had happened again. I found it odd, because, to me, nothing had happened. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD));41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237
A hovering large, rectangle-shaped object with lights over the 150th St. area just south of Dodge Exprsswy;2012-10-29 19:45:00;3 minutes;A hovering large, rectangle-shaped object with lights over the 150th St. area just south of Dodge Exprsswy Between 144th and 156th street exits on the Dodge Expressway, I saw a large object in the sky.  It was a large rectangle shape and all across the front, it had bright white lights.   Underneath the craft, you could see what looked like a faint light coming from inside the object.  At the back, was a red light.   It came from the Southwest and hovered over about 150th St., on the south side of Dodge for about three minutes.

Large rectangle 168th blondo Omaha ne;2012-11-01 20:15:00;5 minutes;Large rectangle 168th blondo Omaha ne At first sight it appeared to look like a pair of bright white headlights in the sky with a flashing red light on the back when it turned 90* to the west.  It was heading from approximately 156 and blondo and we saw it coming toward 168 and blondo.  Flying low - the altitude of a helicopter.  When we got closer, and were practically underneath it we looked up.  No noise made by the craft completely silent. Very large rectangle shape with mini white and red lights underneath. It turned sharply to the southeast and took off.  The last time we could see it it looked like a string of white lights in the sky moving rapidly toward the dodge expressway. Side note: think we saw the same crafts about 45 mins earlier at 156 and dodge area. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

I saw 3 rectangle-shaped objects flying in the sky, while I was outside, approximately 11:00 PM.  ((anonymous report));2017-02-24 23:00:00;2 minutes?;I saw 3 rectangle-shaped objects flying in the sky, while I was outside with my friend at my campfire, approximately 11:00 PM.  And my friends dog was barking like crazy.   We saw it heading toward Ouffut AFB.  These craft were flying very low, and I don't know if anybody else noticed them beside me and my friend.  They couldn't be airplanes, or even helicopters.  They made a very strange humming sound.  They weren't drones either, because they were too big.  That is all I remember.  But it still is spooky!
