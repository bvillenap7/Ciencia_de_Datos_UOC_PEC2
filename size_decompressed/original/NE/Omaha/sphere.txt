Stationary object sighted over Omaha days apart.;2002-09-12 17:30:00;1 hour;Stationary object sighted over Omaha days apart. Standing in parking lot of workplace waiting for a ride. I looked directly up to see a stationary object I estimated to be about 75,000+ feet directly overhead of me at the 96th and L Street intersection of West Omaha. Height estimate is based on height of constant overhead airplane traffic over Omaha which I would imagine to be at roughly 37,000 feet. The object remained stationary for over 45 minutes when another appeared next to it. Spherical, I believe, but too far up to discern any details at all. It looked like a star. The 2nd object appeared and moved away from the other over the course of 10 minutes. I later heard the news of the new moon or space junk which had found orbit around Earth. Perhaps this is it. The sun at these times is 2 hours or so from setting, and it would reflect on this object. The skies were very clear. I saw it again today, 09/16/02 in a slightly different location, and I captured about 20 minutes of it on VHS videotape. Various zooms were used, mostly the camera's max, then some digital zoom (which pixelates...) as well as some pulled back shots with reference items in sight. VHS tape recorded by a Panasonic AG456 SVHS Camera, tripod mounted. I was in the parking lot of my workplace, an audio visual equipment rental company. I narrated all pertinent details such as time, date, height of nearby buildings for reference, on the tape while recording. Feel free to contact me via email. I will mail you a videocassette within a week or so. Thank you,  ((name deleted)) Omaha, NE;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237
Omaha green sphere with tail;2004-05-14 23:15:00;5-6 secinds;Omaha green sphere with tail I was traveling east on I-80 between the 60th street and 42nd steet exits. in the south west sky I saw a Green sphere with a white tail. I was about 20 degrees traviling in a 45 degree down angle. this was about 2 seconds then in leveled out for one or two seconds then again continued in a down 45 degree angle for about 2 seconds then I lost sight of it. If I where to hold my thumb up at arms length my thumb would have covered the sphere completly but not the tail.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237
((NUFORC Note:  Possible satellites??  PD))  A star like object that grew bright white and or Amber.;2004-09-15 21:00:00;12 sec;A star like object that grew bright white and or Amber then simply vanished  as moved across sky. 12 seconds 3 separate occassions following Deep Bible Study:  I am a 1 year newly found Christian. Upon each hour intensive study of Bible, I would venture outside to my patio, observing the heavens for spiritual reflection.   I saw what appeared to be planet/star.  I am a very experienced and educated man. with 20/15 eyesight. I understand depth perception, etc. this had the depth of a planetary body. these were not airplanes, they had the depth of planets. planes usually have a flashing light and disappear with depth horizon slowly and systematicly.  The first 2 sightings were white star shines that moved very effortlessly accross the sky then grew very bright, and immediately vanished.  I know what a shooting star or meteorite is and what it looks like.....This was not a meteorite!  Meteorites very clearly appear in the stratosphere move downward motion, have tails and burnout....This was not That. Finally, the third sighting was the grandest of all it did the same as the other two got bright white, and then as it was directly over my head it Burned Bright Amber or orange as if it were acknowledge me, I felt its presents and again completely disappeared right over my head.   Now I've heard Scholars refer to Chapter in Bible Ezekiel refer to Amber disks as being heavenly Angels.  Do you think that is what this is?  Amber Disks like the ones from Ezekiel? I want to know more. I wanted to tell someone with Education/authority but didn't know where to go.  Do you have reports that are similar to this description?  402 ((number and name deleted))  .....Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have observed satellites.  In the third instance, the event might have been caused by the flare of an Iridium satellite.  PD));41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237
Silver ball hovering over street/ shot up;2006-12-08 06:15:00;60 -80 seconds;Silver ball hovering over street/ shot up I was taking my trash out to the curb this morning. I rolled the can to the curb and started to turn around, when something caught my eye at the top of our street about 50-75 feet away.  The object was a small silver ball about the size of a mini basket ball.  It appeared to be hovering about 1 to 2 feet off the ground from the angle I was looking at it.  The first thing that came to mind was that I was seeing stuff. As I had just woke up for work about 45 min ago. I just sat there looking at it for about 30-40 seconds or so trying to refocus on it thinking that my eyes were playing tricks on me.  Soon I thought what the hell is that, and started walking up the street.  As I was walking up the street I thought that it could be a small Mylar balloon.  But then I thought that a balloon would be moving and this thing was sitting still.  As I got about 30 or so feet from it.  It shot strait up so fast that it looked like it was fired out of a gun. It went out of sight with in 1-2 seconds.   It never made any noise, and had no lights it was just a metallic ball. It really kind a freaked me out.  This is the first time that I have ever seen something that I could not explain.  I am still kind of confused.  I am dead set that my eyes were not playing tricks on me.   I was telling one of my employees about this morning and he said that I should report it.  I had no idea who I should report it to.  So after a Google search I found this site.   However this thing was not a flying saucer, so I am not sure that it should be here or not.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237

The spheres glowed blue along axis lines, like laditude and longitude.  They pulsed rythmicly and went off in all directons.  One that came close was somehow absorbed into a high voltage (700kv aprox) power main.  Then threr was a flash of light and heat, the power went out momentarily, and it was over.

Metallic, green sphere hovering in the sky in the daytime just south of the Dodge Street Exprsway, Omaha, NE;2012-06-30 15:00:00;3 minutes;Metallic, green sphere hovering in the sky in the daytime just south of the Dodge Street Exprsway, Omaha, NE On Saturday afternoon, June 30, 2012, I was driving east on the Dodge Street expressway and saw a green, metallic sphere about 50 feet in the air on the south side of the road in front of the apartments around 180th & Dodge.   At first I thought it was a telephone line buoy that they use to warn airplanes of high lines, but when I got closer to it, it was not attached to anything. It was hovering in the sky and then it seem to float fast from east to west and then hovered over the field on the west side of the apartments.  As I drove on eastward, it went out of sight so I don't know how long it was there. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

2 ufo's following black car down I-80.;2012-12-19 23:00:00;10-15mins;2 ufo's following black car down I-80 I was stareing at a golden ball driving down I-80 going to pick my mom up from work an I noticed that the golden ball I looked at was following me. I stopped on the side of the interstate 2 or three times an when I stopped the gold ufo ball would stop finally I was going west an I noticed it was still following.  I stopped on the side of the interstate threw ny hands up like what, i felt like it was a movie because there were 2 ufo's following me I sped off called my friend he said he couldn't hear me for a minute or so sped around area's with lots of trees so they couldn't follow an they disappeared by the time i went around neighborhoods. but it seemed to follow me off the interstate an when I existed it stopped following. I was in a black car. the object has never followed me in the red car, also I have seen the same thing just flying about 10,000 following firework smoke an after the boston terror thing I noticed there was a golden ball that day flashing ! from gold to red it was going up ames street west bound.If u watch the sky you see them all the time I have seen them going in every direction alot of the time they don't even stop they just fly right over my head one time we were walking an a ufo flew right over head from west to east. I can say Ive seen them go every direction. I think they watch or mess with the people who don't believe because now that I believe there's something else out there they don't bother me any more.  Oh an I was the one that said I say a ufo above the tree in the back yard I forgot to say mark that the reason I noticed the ufo was mainly because I think my dogs were barking at it or at least they were barking towards the ufo I belive the ufo's are portals that aliens can enter our world threw an or they are camera's so they can see where to block the sun but they obvious like to mess with people some times if i think about them I will see a real bright gold right on top of my neighbors house then! when I look it disapaers. I also noticed that the day all of ! the star s were falling, there were the 2 that are always there an all of the sudden both of the balls of light went the opposite direction an diapered. that same day I went out west an saw a silver ball not far off the ground flashing from silver the dark or so you couldn't see it. It was flying around then disapered. I am always watching for activity. I think I would have seen alot more but I never knew about ufo's untill 4 years ago.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237
