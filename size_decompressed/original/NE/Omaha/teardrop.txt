While driving west on I80 at about 0720 I saw a strange shape hovering to the southwest it was somewhat teardrop shaped although it was more like an old coffee pot. It had a vertical smokestack coming out of the top of it that was white. The body alternated dark on the top which sloped to a point like a roof, the middle was white with vertical sides and the bottom was dark and rounded like a bowl.  I estimate it's size at 100 feet tall and 60 feet wide.  It hovered, rising and settling verticaly and drifting to the southwest.  I was watching when it disappeared the first time. It darkened like a shadow fell across it and then their was a blur of sideways motion and it was gone.  I continued to search the sky for it as I continued west on I-80 and as I topped a hill there it was hanging in the sky again where before there was nothing.  I continued watching it rise and settle as it drifted to the west.  It seemed to be parrelleling the Interstate.  The rolling hills blocked my view once more and as I came back to the top of the next hill the object was gone.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237
Saw a black object move from eastern horizon to the western horizon that seemed to be decending at approx. a 30 degree angle;2000-01-26 21:11:00;10-15 seconds;Saw a black object move from eastern horizon to the western horizon that seemed to be decending at approx. a 30 degree angle I am a 31 year old Network Administrator in Omaha, Nebraska. While driving south on interstate 680 in Omaha, I saw a dark black object, barely distinguishable from the nighttime sky, moving across the sky from east to west.  The object had no lights or any visible source of illumination.  It seemed solid in nature, but being only a shade lighter then the surrounding nighttime sky, it was very difficult to see any detail.  No sound was heard.  I could not tell the size of the object or its distance from my vehicle.  Using the perspective of a coin held at arm's length, it was about the size of a penny. This may not be relevant to the above sighting, but my wife saw 2 fighters coming from the approximate direction of the sighting moving toward Offutt AFB 6 minutes after the sighting.  She made a notation of the time because I had called her during the sighting only a short time before.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237
