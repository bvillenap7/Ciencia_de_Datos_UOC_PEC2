A white ball of light being followed by something that took off at a speed I never knew existed.;2000-04-16 20:00:00;20 seconds;A white ball of light being followed by something that took off at a speed I never knew existed. Im guessing on the time and date here.I felt I had to report this.I was at work taking my lunch break.I left the building and walked up the hill to the river which is right to our plant(missouri river).It was dark and the skies were clear as I stood on the top of the hill next to the river bank.I looked up at the sky and saw a roundish bright white ball traveling verticaly west at a speed faster then Ive ever seen anything move Ive seen shooting stars and this exceeded that by tenfold.It looked like something maybe was trying to follow it.Couldnt tell if it was an airplane or not.This went on for Id say 10 seconds when all of the sudden the white fire ball in front just went whoooooosh and moved forward so fast it just disappeared and left a trail of light behind it that disappeared a couple of seconds after it took off.I couldnt tell you what happened to the object that was following it.Ive never ever seen anything like it.After ward I was in shock there was an old man that was our security gaurd I asked him if he saw it and he was in shock also he could barely speak.The next day the omaha world herald printed some ((deleted)) story which I cant remember.However I do remember it not matching up to what WE saw.I apoligise if my dates are off I just didnt have the resources to report this at the time.This is were the missouri river devides Nebraska and Iowa.

BrillianBrilliant green fireball (meteor?) seen arcing toward the ground while moving from the northeast to southeast horizon;2001-04-18 21:21:00;7 to 10 seconds;BrillianBrilliant green fireball (meteor?) seen arcing toward the ground while moving from the northeast to southeast horizon My wife and I were driving eastbound headed to the intersection of 90th and Fort streets when our attention was drawn to a brilliant green fireball in the sky.  The object moved from about 40 degrees high in the Northeast horizon to a trajectory arcing toward the ground southeast of our location. The object had a whitish yellow tail and moved across the sky for approximately 7 to 10 seconds before it appeared to break apart and fizzle out just as it approached the horizon.   From my perspective the fireball was approximately the same luminosity, coloration, and size in the sky as one of the new green LED traffic lights as seen from about a block to two blocks away.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237

Red light over NW Omaha moving south to north before fading away completely.;2010-09-19 21:00:00;3 minutes;Red light over NW Omaha moving south to north before fading away completely. Ball of red light moving from South to North for about a minute.  It seemed to stop, then move North again, before stopping again and suddenly starting to fade, until we could no longer see any light.  I would say the dimming seemed to happen in about 1 minute.
