14 Total Craft (Disc's) sighted, 3 Formations of glowing Disc's, (3) - (5) - (5) and a single one that was reddish;2003-06-22 00:12:00;45 Seconds;14 Total Craft (Disc's) sighted, 3 Formations of glowing Disc's, (3) - (5) - (5) and a single one that was reddish Went out to smoke a cigerette and get boots out of the truck.  Looked up and saw at first what I thought was a satellite and then noticed a 2nd light right behind it and one to the east of the 2nd one.  These 3 were a pure white light color moving at a high rate of speed. Moving SSE to NNW. As they got to the north (3sec) I looked straight back up and saw a formation of 5 Disc's as if following or chasing the group of 3, same speed if not faster. These had an aura or glowing haze on the outer edge with a glowing circular haze in the center.  They did not break formation.  I ran in the house, yelled to 2 friends, ran back out, looked up and saw a 2nd formation of 5 Disc's with the same aura and haze moving in the same direction and speed, this group though changed into a triangular formation and back by the time they got to the north.  Approximately a minute later a single disc, looked to be the size of the first 3 only an off white with reddish tint, same speed and direction was seen.  I've always wanted to see a UFO, never have except for books and pictures, now I have and dont know who to tell or what to do except enter this report.  Hopefully others saw tonight what I saw. Nebraska or South Dakota. I will watch for other reports. ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to this MUFON member for sharing the report with our Center.  PD));41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237
Air Traffic Controller receives a report from airline pilot of UFO's;2004-03-25 19:00:00;20 min;Air Traffic Controller receives a report from airline pilot of UFO's I am an air traffic controller for Minneapolis Center.  This evening at 1900 ((local/Central)) the pilot of an air carrier (heavy) that was under my control reported two flights of two aircraft.  There were no other aircraft in the vicinity at the time.  He said they were 15 miles in front of him at 35,000 feet traveling away from him in a westerly direction.  The UFO's stayed out in front of his aircraft for approximately 15 minutes until the pilot said that the UFO's were so far out in front of him that he could hardly see them anymore.  After being relieved of my duties I reported it to my supervisor who put me in contact of the Military Air Defense.  The person at the other end of the phone said that they saw no objects in the area of this aircraft. ((NUFORC Note:  We have communicated multiple times with this witness, and FAA Air Traffic Controller, as well as with the Supervisor, mentioned above.  They both confirm that no radar returns were visible on the Controller's radar screen at the time of the incident. The case has been forwarded to the National Aviation Reporting Center on Anomalous Phenomenon (<www.narcap.org), Executive Director, Mr. Ted Roe, and Chief Scientist, Dr. Richard Haines, Ph.D., former Senior Research Scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center in San Jose, CA.  The case is under active investigation, and audio and radar data will be requested from the FAA with a Freedom of Information Act request. We express our sincere gratitude to the personnel in the FAA who saw to it that the information was forwarded to our Center!! SPECIAL NOTE:  NUFORC would very much like to speak with the crew members of the aircraft, and most of all, we would very much like to have them submit independent reports, using our Online Report Form, describing what they saw and what happened during their reported sighting.  We guarantee that the anonymity of the witnesses will be protected.  Thank you!  PD));41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237

From the North a light white fuzzy streaked and decelerated. it blinked into existance, it then opened up into an echlon formation with 9 indivudual lights on all sides of the triangle and proceeded on a direct southern course. it was out of sight in no time at all.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237
Strange V-shaped glowing orbs.;2015-09-29 19:15:00;2-3 minutes;Strange V-shaped glowing orbs. I was leaving Council Bluffs via Broadway onto the interstate to Omaha.  As always, I see the skyline of downtown omaha.   Just above the silhouette of the First National Building, I see a white V.  It appeared to be a plane with vapor trails but could not distinguish a plane from it.  Then I saw a bright light that appeared to be a star, but it went from bright, to dim, then disappeared.   At the same time the V appeared to be dropping, not going away from me as an aircraft should.  Then another star appeared in a different area of the sky, but still around the V.   Once again it repeated the cycle as the one before it: bright, dim, then disappeared.  By the time I got to my exit at 30th and Dodge, a third star was starting what appeared to be the same cycle, but I lost it after the horizon went behind the tree line by Boystown/Creighton hospital.  By the time I got to the top of Cuming and 40th the V was starting to go below the tree line further west without any more sightings of the stars.  During the drive from Council Bluffs the star locations were as follows:  9 o'clock of the V,  6 o'clock of the V and 3 o'clock of the V, almost exactly.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237
Moving star like Line formation.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-18 21:00:00;40 minutes;Moving star like Line formation I was leaving the house, looking up at the sky like I always do, and spotted a fine point (star) however this one was moving and behind it another, and another. They were all moving in a perfect line and spaced between one another. No commercial lights. Two of the 16, actually shined an intense, becoming more brighter than the rest that has past by. It doesn’t end there, I went to my brothers place, about 5 miles away and we both looked up and at one point didn’t see anything and then 2 free floating lights flying, however not in formation like before at my house.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237
