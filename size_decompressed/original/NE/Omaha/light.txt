The object was moving back & forth in the sky, in a straight line very rapidly for approx. 10-15 minutes. I could not make out the shape, it was too distant & dark out, but it appeared as a single bright light. Visually, I would compare it to an airplane high in the sky, but the movement did not resemble that of a plane. I watched the object until it seemed to disappear from sight .;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237
Bright, low altitude white light moving accross night sky at medium speed.;2002-06-13 22:14:00;2 minutes;Bright, low altitude white light moving accross night sky at medium speed. I stepped out onto my back deck at about 10:10 P.M. to enjoy the nice, cool, clear night. A couple of minutes later, I noticed a bright, white light moving somewhat towards me from the NNW. I thought that it was strange to see the landing lights of an airplane near my house, as I am not in the flight path of the airport or the Air Force base. The object appeared to be flying at about 10,000 feet and moving at a medium speed. I watched the entire time as it passed just to the west of my home, flying in a SSE direction. The intensity of the light stayed perfectly consistent as it moved toward me then away from me. As it passed, I realized that if those were landing lights, then they would fade as the object passed me, but the light stayed just as intense, so therefore it could not be forward lights on a plane. So then I wondered if it possibly was a helicopter with a spot light, but why so high and there was no obvious beam pointing down, it was just a solid intense light. Then the light disappeared in mid air. At that point it was a few miles south of my home. Then I realized that there were no beacons whatsoever on this craft. I never heard any engine noise, and it was too dark to see if it had a shape. I just thought that it was odd that there were no beacons and how the light just disappeared in mid flight. This was unusual for an aircraft, even a military aircraft, NOT to run its beacons and to be equipped with a light so bright in all directions.

Man witnesses orange ball of light pass across the disc of the Moon.;2004-07-30 00:25:00;2-3 sec.;Man witnesses orange ball of light pass across the disc of the Moon. Telephoned Report:  An adult male called from Omaha, NE, to report having witnessed an orange ball pass across the face of the full Moon.  The object moved from his left to right (east to west), as he faced the Moon, and he estimated the (apparent) size of the object at approximately one twentieth the (perceived) diameter of the full Moon.  The witness reported that the object was seen against the disc of the Moon for approximately 1-2 seconds, and it seemed to disappear as it departed the disc, and continued moving to the west.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237
Apparent intercept of unidentifed 'satellite' by second object.;2005-08-05 22:44:00;3-4 minutes;Apparent intercept of unidentifed 'satellite' by second object. I was outside watching night sky last night and at 22:42 I spotted what I presumed was a satellite moving in a west to east direction. Apparent magnitude about 3-4. As it reached the zenith I checked my watch to note the time so that I could check its identity on the Heavens-Above.com web site, which catalogs satellite and ISS tracks over my location on a nightly basis.  As the object moved into the eastern half of the sky, a second object, moving at what appeared to be at least twice the first object's speed suddenly appeared to its south and intercepted the first object and then disappeared.  The first object continued on at its original speed and eventually became to faint to follow.  I looked in vain for the track of the second object, which I thought might be a second satellite, but its speed and trajectory suggests to me that it wasn't an ordinary earth satellite with which I am familiar.  It may have been a meteorite, but again, the odds of a meteorite appearing to intercept the original object would seem to be way too long to be probable. As soon as the first satellite disappeared from view, I went into the house and looked up possible candidates crossing my area at 22:42 on a similar orbital flight path.  There was only one object, a Cosmos rocket, in the sky at that time, but its trajectory was wrong.  While the transit of the original object lasted several minutes -- which is the normal passage time for an earth satellite -- the interception episode last perhaps a second or less.  In fact the event took place so quickly, that I have the distinct impression that there were actually several objects that intercepted the first, coming from different vectors, but I am only sure about the one intercept which is the one that caught my attention.  I was very excited about seeing this unusual phenomenon, made more so when I learned that there were no publically-cataloged satellites operating on this trajectory (orbit)at this time of the evening over my location in East Central Nebraska. While the first object could be an unlisted spy satellite, the second object is a complete unknown.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237

White light flies over Omaha;2006-09-04 21:30:00;1 minute;White light flies over Omaha Monday (9/04/06) evening I had stepped into my brothers backyard with his 18 month old daughter in my arms.  It was dark and the moon was high and to the left as I faced south.   As soon as I stepped out of the house, the first thing I saw was not the moon, but a very bright, fast moving, white light in the sky.  It was as bright as the moon and at first I thought it was the police helicopter with it's searchlight on.   It took only seconds for me to realize that was not what I was seeing.  My niece, whom I do not count as a witness due to her age, could not stop pointing at it.   Once I realized this was no ordinary craft, I yelled in the house for my brother to come out and see it.  In doing so, I alerted the entire house.  In all, 4 adults, an eleven year old, and my 18 month old niece all saw the phenomena.   The light moved across the sky from west to east.  It moved in a fairly quick, yet consistent speed.  It only varied course slightly when it appeared to be manuevering to it's left and right.   In all, the light was visible for about 1 minute.  At it's end, it disolved into the distance.   We then stayed outside for about half an hour to star gaze.  In that half an hour we saw several commercial flights at various elevations, a satellite in orbit, and the police helicopter did fly over (without searchlight)and was obvious to us that if the helicopter did fly over we would have definately heard it.   Ruling those things out, we came to two possibile conclussions 1 )it was an outer worldly craft, 2) being that we live in Omaha, we are accustomed to seeing craft from the S.A.C. airforce base (B-2 Steaths, fighter jets, etc...).  However, this craft made no banking turn to where the base would be located and seemed to dissapear once it passed the moon.   We are fairly certain that this was no government aircraft and are just curious to see if you have heard of any similar reportings in this area.   This was my second personal encounter, the first took place in 1990 and was no where near as i! mpressive.   Thank you for your time.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237

Bright light over west Omaha at 11:45pm Oct. 5th.;2007-10-05 23:45:00;35 seconds;Bright light over west Omaha at 11:45pm Oct. 5th. Friday night on October 5th. I was driving home from a friends house and was traveling south on I-680. At about 11:45pm I was just about up to the Dodge Street exit when I noticed an extremely bright blue white light low in the sky. This object had no tail or contrail and was moving way to quickly to be an aircraft in a tower controlled airspace (TCA). I saw none of the red or green lights associated with conventional aircraft either. The object appeared to fly over the interstate then pitched up a bit before it went completely dark. I raced home and checked the Heavens-above website for any satellite or ISS overflights of the area at that time. I could find nothing flying over Omaha for that time period. I was able to see the ISS flying overhead at about 7:40pm on Saturday night October 6th. It was not anywhere near as bright nor was it moving as fast as the object I had seen the night before. I reported the friday night sighting to a friend who is a MUFON investigator and he suggested I also send a report to this website.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237

Normal visual occurance of the light orb's sighted over Omaha during any clear night since Novembor 07.  Through binoculars, saw many mini lights fling out of larger star like object like so many star cinders into the night.  These cinder stars would swarm the orginal bright mother star like moths to a light bulb.  3 different formations of 3 each were spotted shortly there after floating above us.  We were around Standing Bear Lake as usual.  Through the binoculars star a fixed formation of stars shift in unison as if in a breeze.  They would shift for west to east, Then south, back west, then north again.  This uniform shift feature could only be seen with the binoculars looking straight up.  Unseen to naked eye.  Had the impression that this huge uniformity connected all the naked eye light orbs.  Estimated size of this new larger light craft could easily be 5 square blocks of craft below the low level cloud layer roughly 4,000 ft up.  Quite silent, and beautiful.  To the casual observer, un noticeable.  Look up Omaha.  They are here EVERY night.  Numerous cesna like craft attempted to fly through these formations and left after 19 minutes.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237
Bright white light turned red and dissappreaed, later a wave of small lights from the same spot;2008-11-22 18:10:00;1 minute;Bright white light turned red and dissappreaed, later a wave of small lights from the same spot On November 22, 2008 at 18:10 Central time myself, a preschool teacher and both of my parents, a nurse and a small business owner, were outside and witnessed a very big and very bright white light moving in the sky.  It moved from west to north-east and suddenly turned red.  Then seemed to accelerate rapidly and vanish from sight.  We live within two miles of Epply Airfield and have seen a lot of airplanes and this was no airplane.  It was a solid white light, silent and moving very rapidly before it turned solid red and disappeared. About 20 minutes later I was still outside looking for something else to happen when I saw what could only be described as a wave come from the spot that the light disappeared.  It came from one spot and spread out only going both directions horizontally.  It looked almost like a flock of birds but it was going in two different directions and was moving very fast.  There was no sound to it and I lost sight of it over the horizon.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237

At closer look it was very high in the sky, no sounds were audible, and no blinking lights, or shape were visible.  The light appeared to be very high and seemed to change directions from approching to reversing and it ascended upward very fast and then the bright light just disappeared without a trace(as if someone just turned off the flood light).  I have no idea what it was but I have never seen any known aircraft travel at those speeds to not be visible that quickly.

Bright lights moving across the sky.;2012-05-22 22:30:00;30mins;Bright lights moving across the sky. We first noticed a bright light that was flashing in the sky. It flashed 2 - 3 times and then stpped. The light then resembled a small star and did not appear to be moving. A second bright light light showed up 10 minutes later, but located more directly overhead and was constantly bright(not flashing). The second light appeared to be moving slightly in circular motions. About 10 minutes after the second light appeared, the first light that resembled a small start suddenly flew across the sky and the two lights began to move around eachother very noticeably. The two lights were far too distant to be any type of aircraft.  They resembled stars. They also changed directly rapidly and moved in circular motions.  I have not seen air planes or other flying objects move like this.  Also, the smaller light that moved across the sky, moved very quickly within a second or two. I can't imagine any object that is capable of moving this fast. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237
Omaha,Nebraska eye witness sighting orange and red light that flashed white light small red lights flew over and two red lights flew;2012-06-12 04:00:00;1 hour;Omaha,Nebraska eye witness sighting orange and red light that flashed white light small red lights flew over and two red lights flew I went outside my apartment building at 4 am on 6-12-2012.  I live in Omaha Nebraska.  I looked into the northwest sky and had noticed an orange and red light high in the sky. I could not tell how high in the sky it was.  It looked like it was the size of Venus when it was viewable in May 2012,  But it was too low in the sky to be Venus.  To gauge the distance I would have to say it was, at least from my perspective, least five miles northwest of my corner of 19th and Douglas st. As I looked at it it would pulse orange and red. Sometimes it would flash a bright white light.  It just hovered in the sky motionless.  After walking three blocks west on Douglas which took about 10 minutes in a casual walk, I had noticed a bright red light, a much smaller light, had flew from the south and flew in an arch over the orange and red light and I had lost track of it.  After that happened about 15 minutes later I saw two red lights flying side by side heading east.  I could hear a helicopter flying around behind me but I could not see it.  I saw the red lights that flew together as they passed over my head.  They did not blink or flash they were at a constant glow.  The red was like the color of crimson. I looked back at the red orange light in the sky still motionless.  I watched it for about 15 more minutes and there was no movement, I could still hear helicopters, but they were not close to the object as I could tell.  I walked back to my apartment, which took about 10 minutes and went to the roof of my building. There are eleven floors on my building and I went to the roof, which opens at 5am.  I went to the roof to see if I could still see this light.  It was still there.  From higher up I could see that it was far too low in the sky to be celestial.  The sun was starting to come up and it was harder to see but it was still there.  I cant quite gauge the distance from me it was, but if I may submit a photo showing the building and where it was in the sky in relation to the building it would be easier for me to explain. It slowly moved northwest and slowly disappeared from sight. Sighting ended about 5:15am on 6-12-2012;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237

At the intersection of 156th street and Military Road I observed two clusters of orange lights. The first cluster was composed of four lights. The lights were roughly one mile south of my position and traveling west. Three of the lights formed a triangle that seemed to retain its shape as it moved. The fourth light's position relative to the triangle seemed to shift as the cluster traveled west. The second cluster of three orange lights passed overhead my position at the same time. This cluster was also traveling west. The lights seemed to be moving independently. I did not observe any aircraft position lights associated with these lights that were much closer to my position than the first cluster.

Red light moving rapidly across the sky in all directions at immense speed.;2017-06-22 21:06:00;10 minutes;Red light moving rapidly across the sky in all directions at immense speed. Sighted at plane height over Omaha, Nebraska.  We watched from a hill and initially spotted it as a small, stationary, red ball of light.  It would occasionally switch to a blinking green light and then back to red.  After looking at it for some time, it rapidly moved to the left, stopped, and it changed to a blinking green light. It then ascended in the blink of an eye (literally).  As soon as you blinked, the light was an immense distance higher than it had been a second previously.   We could see it ascending through the clouds so quickly that it could've climbed out of our sight in probably two seconds.  It then turned back to a static red light (stopped flashing) and darted to the right across the entire sky.  It was moving so quickly that we had to sprint to keep up with it.  It covered the whole horizon.   It then paused on a dime, shifted slightly to the left, and began a fast descent until it disappeared from sight into storm clouds.  Only one light was observed.  It was so high in the sky, and so erratically moving, that we could not place it as any normal object.  We have never seen a normal object move so quickly and at such a high height.   It was also quite far away, so for it to look as though it was moving so quickly, it must have been going at an unfathomably rapid speed.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237
Large bright object that was low on the horizon was pulsating in a stat. position steadily changing color.((NUFORC Note:  Sirius?  PD));2019-01-03 22:30:00;30 minutes;A large bright object that was low on the horizon was pulsating in a stationary position steadily changing color. On January 3rd, 2019, at approximately 22:30 to 23:00, I observed a large, stationary object low in the southeast sky.  My girlfriend, a person on YouTube and I all observed it.  At first glance the object could have been mistaken for Venus but it was too large.  As a process of elimination, I verified that there were no planets or major stars at that location with Google night sky and manual observations of celestial bodies.  I also eliminated the possibility of aircraft easily as there were several commercial aircraft flying at different altitudes and directions.  All the aircraft were very small in comparison. The object appeared to be round but pulsed brightly in a fashion that made it look like it was flaring the light in a sort of diamond shape.  The object cycled through multiple colors at a steady rate and exhibited a range of color beyond what is seen on commercial and private aircraft. There was no sound but I can't say for sure it was silent as it seemed to be several miles away across the city.  I assumed that this object had to have been seen by more people than myself due to its size, color shifting and duration that it was visible.  I scanned the local news the following day and none of them mentored it.  I did find a video on YouTube of someone else that did see it, and they shot a video of it with their phone.  I didn't stay out to see the object disappear but the person shooting the video did.  They filmed it until it just vanished from sight.  It didn't fly away.  It faded from view while never moving during the entire episode. I will attempt to upload the video or link it for you to review.  I didn't try recording it myself because my phone camera doesn't zoom out to distances that far well and the video from the other person I found does not properly show exactly how large and brilliant the object actually was.

Unusual fast moving object overtaking ISS;2019-12-10 17:40:00;2 minutes;Unusual fast moving object overtaking ISS This evening, Dec 10th, 2019, I was observing the track of the ISS over Omaha, Nebraska from 5:36 pm local time to 5:42 local time.  The ISS track was from the northwest to the southeast.  As the ISS came to a point high in the sky, I observed another object overtake the ISS, and nearly on the same path as the ISS.  The object was moving across the sky much faster (perhaps 5 times faster, or even more) than the ISS.  It passed the ISS within a degree or two about when the ISS was overhead, and continued on to the southeast.  The object did not maintain a constant brightness, rather it became visible for perhaps 3 or 4 seconds and then faded out for several seconds, but on a repeating and consistent basis, as if it were tumbling.  It appeared to be a point source and did not have lights (strobes, rotating beacon, navigation lights, etc.)  that would be representative of an aircraft.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237
I was out in my backyard to pickup chairs that had blown down durin  ((Spacelink satellites));2020-03-06 20:15:00;10 minutes;In evening of 03/06/2020 Omaha Nebraska, Dundee neighborhood @ 8:15 I was out in my backyard to pickup chairs that had blown down during the day.  We had just returned from dinner.  I looked up in the sky as it was a very clear crisp night.  At this time I noticed one non blinking light moving across the sky.  As I followed the light across moving West to East I noticed another duplicate light spaced in line behind it, then another and another.  I called my wife out to witness the lights, she commented it's probably drones and went inside after viewing 4 of the lights in a row.  For ten minutes the string of lights, which must have been about 20 to 30 total moved across the sky from West to NorthEast.  The lights were non blinking white lights spaced proportionally with no sound.  The entire string was proportional except for one group if two light in the middle of the string that were much closer to each other.  As the lights crossed from West to NorthEast above my back yard, I could see and hear large flocks of geese flying underneath the lights. The light were much higher than the geese.  Additionally in the North East a helicopter was flying South to North above downtown of Omaha it crossed under the path of lights.  The lights were same size as stars which were starting to appearing as the evening got darker.  Unlike a plane the lights did not blink and were constant like a satellite.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237
