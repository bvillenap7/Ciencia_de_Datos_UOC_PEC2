Dreams;1980-01-01 02:00:00;24 yrs;I'm not sure where to begin...  My earliest memory dates back to when I was an infant.  I'm not sure how old I was but my next memory is my third birthday.I remember a gift that I got and I also remember having this first memory at that time.I can recall even at that age a want to hold on to it and I have.  I am lying on my back in the grass.It is night and there is cool a lite breeze.I remember this because I could feel it blowing my hair around.It tickled my forhead.I felt very at ease and calm.  The sky was so beautiful.It was filled with dozens of geometric shapes.There were many different colors and they had a soft internal glow that bordered on translucence.They were very soothing and I felt that they were my friends.I know that they were soothing me,like a mother would a child.I cant explain in words what I felt inside but it was like communicating.  The duration is probably about 2-5 minutes.Throughout my childhood,it was always my strongest memory and inspired me in everything I did.I've always thought that it is what sparked my curiosity about sciece at an early age(got my first shock at 5 by poking around in a telephone outlet).  Anyhow,when I was 13,I went to live with my grandparents as a result of my mothers death.I stayed in my dads old room.At about the age of 15,I started having weird dreams.There were so many that I cannot remember the chronology,but I will state some.  One of the first was one in which I was having a dream about eating cereal.I thought I started to fall back in the chair and got that rushing,falling into oblivion feeling,that woke me up.I was lying flat on my back in bed and someone approached me from the left.I couldn't move.From here it gets a little foggy,from terror I think,but he lifted my shirt up to my armpit then used something to cut me just under my left nipple.It didnt hurt but I was very scared.I then felt a horrible,numb,type of pain.A pulling sensation coming from the area where I was cut.I couldnt turn my head to see,but out of the corner of my eye,I could see him pulling out a piece of tissue.The pain was incredible.That all I remember until the next morning.My chest was a little sore and I had light scratch in the exact area where he cut me.I also have no muscle in the lower portion of my left breast.I'm 25 years old today,I work out,and I still have no muscle in that area.  Another dream is one where I wake up in the middle of the night.There is a pink hazy light coming from my window.I get up and look out.It looks like daytime on an overcast day except in pink.I look to see what time it is and my clock is not on.No power in the whole house,so I dont know what time it is.I had a very strange feeling at this point and decided to go outside.The sky was overcast and pink.Where I live was only a mile north of Rosenblatt Stadium and you could see it from the backyard.We also weren't to far from S.A.C,so on some days you could wee jets flying in that area. I went around to the back and was shocked to se the sky filled with U.F.O.'s.Discs,cylinders,pyramids,spheres,Etc.I also felt that they saw me,or better yet,were waiting for me.I dont remember anything after that.  There are many more but I am no good at typing and am tiring already.  One day I got up the guts to bring them up to my dad, jokingly,and he later confided in me similar experieces he had as a young man in that house.  At the age of 18,I moved to AZ and the dreams stopped.I moved back to a rural part of NE 1 yr later.I have been here for almost 7 yrs now.The dreams have started again and now they involve my young son.This also coincides with a recent sighting of a U.F.O.(it was on the news,on tape).I really wish they would stop.I call them dreams but honestly,there is nothing more real at the time.I've never told anyone else about them before,and feel kind of silly,but I need to get it off of my chest.  I know this isn't a specific sighting,but I had to get it out.Sorry. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.

Wishbone frame over southwest Omaha, emerging from clouds.;2007-11-02 23:52:00;10 Minutes;Wishbone frame over southwest Omaha, emerging from clouds. Witnessed two flat, noiseless objects within five minutes of each other. They appeared to have a skeletal, wishbone like frame and moved across the sky like a glider might move. We could not make out any defined body but there did seem to be some kind of dark area within the frame. The back end or tail had no real definition it seemed to almost fade into the sky. The crafts were in sight for approximately ten seconds each, before we lost sight of them. These two crafts came out of what appeared to be high altitude cirrus clouds, moving in a east-southeasterly direction. The clouds were long, thin and transparent, localized to a specific area in the sky. The clouds themselves seemed to last no more then two hours in duration. I noticed them at eleven pm central time and had completely vanished out of sight at about one fifteen am. The crafts seemed to emerge directly out of the cloud bank(?) both crafts heading in a southeasterly fashion.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237
4 objects flying into storm;2012-05-19 22:30:00;5 min;4 objects flying into storm I was watching a set of severe thunderstorms coming in from the south. My house faces west and have a view of horizon.  Observing the storm I looked up and saw a red/orange light traveling southwest.  The object was very low traveling under cloud level.  The light faded and I could a black structure still traveling at same altitude heading into the storm.  After the first object disappeared I soon saw a second light coming from NE to SW.  The object followed in the same path and appeared to mimick the first object.  This happened twice again to make it four objects.  These were traveling against wind heading into storm.  They were all maintaining same altitude above cloud line.  Estimated 1500-2000 ft.  Very intense experience.  I've lived near air traffic my whole life and this was no plane. Made no noise!  Not balloons or lanterns because of maintained altitude!   WOW!!!!!!!;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237

While running in the early morning, a friend and I witnessed an object flying at a low altitude emitting an orange glow behind it.;2012-11-16 05:30:00;5 seconds;While running in the early morning, a friend and I witnessed an object flying at a low altitude emitting an orange glow behind it. My friend and I were running this morning, 11/16/2012, the same route we run every Friday at that time.  It was still dark, stars were out.   Out of the corner of my eye I caught movement and a light.  I looked up and some type of craft was passing in front of my line of sight.  It was a dark half-circle shape I believe and had an orange glow behind it across the entire back of the object.  The orange glow tailed out behind for a short distance and there seemed to be occasional sparks within the glow.    The object continued past moving to the southwest, maintaining a constant altitude which was fairly low in the sky.  Neither one of us heard any sound coming from the craft.  It seemed to be moving at a high rate of speed but was easy to follow across the sky until we lost it over the hill.  My friend’s initial thought was that it was a meteor, but I didn’t get that feeling at all.  It was maintaining a constant altitude and seemed to be banking slightly to the! Southwest.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237

Sighting of V-shaped UFO less then 100' from my deck.;2015-10-04 20:20:00;4:00;Sighting of V shaped UFO less then 100' from my deck. Craft appeared cloaked in a cloud shape and moving slowly from North to South.  I was standing on my deck facing east on the third floor of my apartment building.  It was approximately 50' to my left when I spotted it and no more then 10' above me.  As it slowly moved and came abreast of me it changed shape into a solid form.  It was dark or grey in color and seemed very large.  Maybe 50'to 75' across in a V shape.  There were no lights and a very faint wind sound.  I couldn't see the front, only the V shape of the wings.  It continued moving slowly south and changed back to a white cloud shape. It passed right above a tree and simply disappeared.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237
