Dark brown circular object flew silently South-Southeast.;1999-12-15 20:00:00;<1 minute;Dark brown circular object flew silently South-Southeast. I was dropping my 8-year old son at his mother's house about 8pm central standard time, Wednesday, December 15.  The sky was mostly clear.  We got out of the car and looked up, hoping to see leftover shooting stars from the Geminid shower.  I saw a circular object, mostly dark brown with a slighty lighter shade in front, flying steadily South-Southeast.  The object showed no lights and made no sound.  It was unusual in its apparent size and altitude.  It might have been a hot air balloon, except I saw no basket or burner.  It could not have been a plane there were no lights and no wings.  It was no bird the flight was too high and steady.  The altitude must have been several thousand feet.  I watched for a minute or so as it flew out of my sight. Unprompted, my son asked, What was THAT? It looked like a flying rock or something. There were no unusual power outages - my car continued to run during the sighting.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237

I saw a semi-circular object with bright yellowish/orange lights that rapidly flew away in Omaha.;2007-04-02 06:35:00;1 minute;I saw a semi-circular object with bright yellowish/orange lights that rapidly flew away in Omaha. At 6:35 I was driving Westbound on Underwood street at about 66th street. I saw a semi-circular outline in the sky with yellowish/orange lights. I did'nt get the best look as I turned the corner towards Dodge St. As I turned West on Dodge I saw it again but now it was further in the distance. Then as it moved SW very quickly and was out of sight in a matter of seconds.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237

I saw a green circular light about 500 to 1000 feet off the ground.   It then immediatedly accelerated hard covering 1 1/2 to 2 miles in under one second.   The light then disappeared and I don't know if it turned or what happend.   The skies were perfectly clear and I tried to look for reflections that may have caused this effect, but I did not see any.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237
Orange lights over Omaha Nebraska.  Not fireworks!;2010-07-04 21:00:00;10-15 min;Orange lights over Omaha Nebraska.  Not fireworks! We were on the lake watching fireworks when I noticed a glowing orange object in the sky.  This object moved right to left, then stopped.   After flying for a minute or 2, the flow stopped and the only way I can describe it is a can of chewing tobacco dark in color flying through the sky.  It disappeared behind some clouds.  10 or so minutes later I and my entire family on the boat saw the same thing, but now there were 3 of them.  This time they did not stop glowing orange.  This went on for 5 min.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237
Bright orange circle object heading North behind clouds.;2010-07-16 20:53:00;5 seconds;Bright orange circle object heading North behind clouds. Looking to the west, there was a beautiful sunset with this really unique cloud.  I was admiring the bright orange red shining up through the clouds.  It was then I saw a bright orange circle object heading North through the sky and fly behind the clouds.   Not sure what it was but I was taken back as it didn't seem to have the characteristics of anything I would expect to see.  Not ruling out a plane but it didn't appear anything like one.   Unfortunately I was driving and by the time I got to stop and watch the cloud, I didn't see the object again.   Hope someone else saw this as well and can shine a light on this.

The object was moving abnormally, with orange rectangular lights around the sides of it that went dim and then very bright.;2011-07-04 22:00:00;10 minutes;The object was moving abnormally, with orange rectangular lights around the sides of it that went dim and then very bright. When my girlfriend and i were out on her third floor apartment balcony watching fireworks on the horizon, we noticed a circular object fly into view, moving back and forth, then stopping, hovering, high above the interstate, then moving away and disappearing very quickly. About 5 minutes later, it reappeared, moving back and forth, then hovering for approximately 10 minutes above the same part of the interstate before quickly disappearing into the sky.   The object had rectangular orange lights around the sides of it, moving in a circular motion, that appeared to go dim and then very bright, almost looking like an orange star.  We had a chance to examine it enough that there were no red blinking or white lights on it, as we normally see on a helicopter or airplane, it was flying much lower than airplanes we had previously seen flying over this area, and it wasn't moving in a way a helicopter would, as in circling an area.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237

Red glowing light seen over West Omaha sky evening of 05/28/2012;2012-05-28 21:20:00;21:45;Red glowing light seen over West Omaha sky evening of 05/28/2012 Hello, this event just took place on 05/28/2012 from the time period 21:25 to 21:45.I was going to the bathroom 2nd floor in a house that is on a fairly good sized hill.Sitting on the toilet looking out the window i was looking and when appeared a bright red light above the tree line.I watched this red light which traveled slowly and methodically without blinking or moving wildly.It seemed it was looking for something or was programmed on a slow paced circular pattern above the area of the city.At that time i called for my brother to come see what i was looking at.  He ran upstairs and we watched it together.  The red light started to dim and then slowly faded completely.We could still see the darkness of the craft,i threw open the window and could hear no motor or any type of small engine sounds coming from that area in the sky.It then slowly moved out of my line of sight and disappeared.I then ran downstairs and outside the backdoor,down on the lawn so we could! see better.  It was around 5 minutes standing outside waiting when almost ready to go inside because of biting misquitoes when another red light very similar to the first light appeared in the same area as when i saw the first one. This object looked brighter and moved very similar but the light stayed consistant this rime never fading,it was almost cigar shaped like a torch but then became smaller and more cylyndrical like a circle.We watched until it slowly and methodically disappeared westward towards the horizon.It was less than 5 minutes again when appeared in the same vacinity as the first two,a massive bright torchlike shaped cigar which was 10 times brighter than the first two.Following very close near that location was an immense bright &quotwhite&quot light from a mid-sized what appeared to be a military plane headed towards my direction,toward the military base-Offutt/Space-Strat Com. Bellevue,Nebraska.The red object then floated slowly and traveled in a similar ! pattern as the first two,it traveled this slow pattern again h! eading w estward toward the horizon.These lights seemed to be individual separate lights.Never blinking or flashing just the first mentioned which faded then re-appeared.I think it was probably a military test craft or drone,just my opinion but I wanted to make sure i wrote this report as quickly as I saw it asap.Thank you.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237
