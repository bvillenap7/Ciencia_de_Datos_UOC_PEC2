Silvery, triangular objects at low altitude.;1979-05-15 20:00:00;30 seconds;Silvery, triangular objects at low altitude The event I am describing occured when I was 7 years old.  Although I was quite young, and the event occured over 20 years ago, what I saw is as vivid in my mind as if it occured yesterday.  I have shared this information with family and friends, but not with any official agency or group. My family had recently moved into a new home in a development in the suburbs.  The area was still fairly undeveloped, and so without the interference of city lights, the night time sky could often be quite spectacular.  For this reason, I had become quite fond of stargazing.  On one particular evening in the spring of 1979, my mother had left to make a shopping trip.  She promised my brother and me that if we were on our best behavior she would buy us a surprise.  Eagerly anticipating her return, my brother and I knelt on our couch staring out our large picture window while we waited for her. As was my habit at the time, I was gazing up at the sky through our window when I noticed a brightly lit object in the sky, appearing to be at a fairly low altitude, heading in the general direction of our house.  As the object came closer, I noticed that it was roughly triangular in shape, and had a silvery appearance.  It looked to be illuminated, that is, it was plain to see and fairly bright in the sky, but didn't appear to have any lights on its exterior surface.  Despite its relatively low altitude (about 1000 feet or so) it made no noise that I could hear.  I say this with some confidence because the object flew almost directly overhead. Almost immediately after the first object passed overhead, I noticed several more heading in the same direction.  Within maybe 15 seconds several objects, all similar in appearance to the one described previously, passed overhead following the same path as the first object.  The objects flew in what was basically a single file type flight pattern, with one directly following the other.  I was in awe, not sure of what I was seeing.  I didn't count the total number, but several passed overhead in approximately a 30 second period.  The objects came as quickly as they went, and my brother and I yelled for my father, who was in the other room.  When we explained what we'd seen, he quickly dismissed it, telling us we'd probably seen reflections of light in the sky or something else.  However, I remember the sky being clear that night so I doubt this could have simply been lights reflecting on clouds.  Moreover, as this was a new development, there were very few sources of light that could have caused this.  Furthermore, I know what I saw.  The objects where silver colored, and triangular in shape.  I have never since seen anything in the sky that I could discribe as similar.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237
Multiple triangle-shaped, silver objects in night sky.;1979-08-01 22:00:00;2 minutes;Multiple triangle-shaped, silver objects in night sky. This event occurred in the summer of 1979.  I distinctly remember that it was dark and that there was cloud cover.  My estimation is that it would have been approximately 22:00.  At the time, my family was living in the Millard community in Sarpy County, just outside of Omaha, Nebraska. On the evening of the event, my brother and I had been allowed to stay up late, as we were waiting for our mother to return from a shopping trip.  Our house had a large picture window in the living room (facing west), and our couch was situated with its back against the window.  My brother and I had been kneeling on the couch facing backwards, allowing us to look out the picture window. After several minutes, I noticed what appeared to be a bright object in the western sky, and that it was moving east at a high rate of speed.  As the object became closer, I noticed that it was triangular shaped and silver in color.  I also noticed that there were several similar objects, traveling in single file, all flying at the same speed and in the same direction.  Each object was flipping end-over-end, at a rate of approximately 1 flip every 2 seconds. As I previously mentioned, there was cloud cover on the evening in question.  The objects were all flying below the cloud cover.  They also appeared to be maintaining a very constant altitude, despite the fact that they were flipping.  I’d have estimated that the objects were flying at an altitude of approximately 2,500 feet and that they were roughly 150 feet in length. The objects were silver in color and were clearly visible, yet did not appear to have any lights.  Rather, their surfaces were simply illuminated, as if the skin of each craft was its own light source.  Their flight path took them directly over our house, so I was able to get a good look at them as they flew over.  They made no sound at all, had no obvious vapor trails or exhaust and did not flash, blink or pulse any light.  The skin, however, did appear to shimmer.  The best description I could offer for this shimmering would be to take a very reflective piece of foil, crumple it into a ball, unfold and flatten the foil, then shine a flashlight at the foil, moving the light quickly across the foil’s surface. In total, 4 of the objects passed overhead, at the rate of 1 every 15 seconds or so.  The total duration of the event, from our first noticing the objects to them passing over our house and out of view, was about 2 minutes.  That was the first and only time that we saw the objects.

Triangular object observed;1999-07-06 22:00:00;5 minutes;Triangular object observed Triangular shaped object observed moving silently across the sky at night.  Observers were waiting for a small private fireworks show when it was spotted.  Initially it appeared as if three slightly red stars were moving in unison, then the observer realized that light in the background was disappearing and reappearing on the other side as the craft moved, signifying that it was a solid object.  The sides were about 2.5cm or an inch at arms length.  The object was a black, right isosceles triangle with a slightly red light at each corner.  There was also a very faint red ring at the center that was not immediately noticeable being about a quarter to a third of its overall size.  I can't give a directional orientation, but it moved across the sky totally silent with a constant speed.  The sighting lasted around 5 minutes.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237
Observation of large, illuminated triangle-shaped craft passing over city as we were traveling to Hospital;2000-11-22 22:15:00;1.5 minutes;Observation of large, illuminated triangle-shaped craft passing over city as we were traveling to Hospital My daughter and I were on the way to the Hospital emergency room, as she was having a migraine that we could not get under control at home. We were traveling South from Ames Avenue on 60th Street when we noticed a set of lights proceeding North / North - West, fairly low in the sky. At first, we didn't think anything of this, as we live near a major airport, and this would not be an unusual approach for an aircraft heading for a landing. As it got close, however, my daughter said that it seemed odd that there were no strobe or red / green lights typically seen on planes that go by. All this one had was a series of white lights, of equal amplitude, that seemed to be spaced out all along and around the edges of the object. Even though she had a migraine, this was so strange that she asked me to turn off the road we were on and West, just so we might catch a better look at the object as it passed overhead. We did this, quickly, and were almost directly underneath the object as it moved on its North / North-West path. There were no airplane engine sounds, and more important, we could not see any fuselage. The object was triangular in shape, and there were lights along the edges and at the corners. We watched as it moved out of sight...never making the 'turn' to the East that one would normally expect an airplane heading for Omaha's airport to make. We then went on to the Hospital.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237
Black, triangular shaped observed over Omaha in daylight;2001-08-29 18:00:00;30 - 45 seconds;Black, triangular shaped observed over Omaha in daylight I was traveling on Crown Point, just where it connects to Blair High Road. The direction of Crown Point is curving roughly South West (SW), and when stopped at Blair High Road intersection, you are facing just about SW. In the distance I saw a black shape moving through the air almost directly eastward. With many years of Air Force experience and familiarity with the air traffic patterns of the area, my immediate presumption was this had to be either a dark colored B1 or possibly B2 bomber heading in for a landing at Offutt AFB. Then, to my utter surprise, the object 'banked' giving me an edge on view...and what I now saw was a very long, narrow angled black triangle. Having seen number of 747s at that distance, I would estimate it at about that length. It was clearly not the shape of a B2, which I have seen in daylight and night flight configurations. It was not a B1, first, because the only time it's wings are back in a 'delta' type configuration is when it is flying at high speed (which this craft was not), and second, because the shape was way to narrow and triangular. I determined to stop and keep watching this craft, but I first looked down to my Van's clock to see the exact time...and when I looked up, the craft was gone.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237

HUGE TRIANGULAR OBJECT PASSED SILENTLY OVER MY HEAD;2004-03-09 23:10:00;30 seconds;HUGE TRIANGULAR OBJECT PASSED SILENTLY OVER MY HEAD I was jogging this evening when I saw a very large triangular object passing directly over my head.  I live only miles from STRATCOM and see military aircraft on a daily basis.  This craft made no distinguishable sound, left no contrail, and was very difficult to see even when I was looking at it passing directly above me.  There were approximately 8 points of light on its leading edge that looked the same luminosity as the dimmest stars in the night sky.  The object was coming from the southeast, which is the general direction of STRATCOM from my location, and traveling toward the northwest.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237
Three white lights in a triangle formation moving west over Omaha;2004-10-09 22:00:00;about 3 minutes;Three white lights in a triangle formation moving west over Omaha It was around 10:00 PM and i went outside onto my friends back patio to cool off.  As I was laying there I looked up at the sky and saw 3 white lights in a perfect triangle formation.  I stared at it to see if i could see any flashing colored lights to indicate an airplane, but it was just 3 white lights moving at the same speed and not changing formation.  As it went out of my site of view I still laid there thinking about what it could have been, and then about 5-10 minutes later I saw an airplane go over and it looked nothing like what i just saw.

UFO seen as low as 65 feet!!!!!!;2006-04-07 23:45:00;15 minutes;UFO seen as low as 65 feet!!!!!! I was on my way home, and was driving on the interstate. I saw a bright light almost 3 miles away but could'nt tell what it was.   About 2 miles ahead, I could see something hovering above the interstate overpass.  And as i came closer, I could see that it was only maybe 90ft. in the air!  I could see people standing outside and other people slowing down, almost to a complete stop just to look at it.  It had 3 lights on it, and all were at the front of the aircraft. The colors were red and a bright floressant white color.  The aircraft it self was probably about 35-45 ft. in width, and to be honest, I really can't tell what color it was. The color of it was almost midnight or camoflauge.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237

What looked like a moving V shaped pattern of stars caught my eye. I was amazed and had to stand up and get a closer look. I could see the UFO to the east, moving south at a constant speed. There were about 5 or 6 white lights down the two lengths of the V. It was approximately 2-3 miles away. I could only see the lights, no silhouette. As a street light blocked my view, I could no longer see it.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237
Triangle Object;2011-05-17 17:20:00;20 minutes;Triangle Object I reported numerous Discs sighted back on June 22nd 2003 (see Nuforc.org). Since then I have constantly watched the sky with binoculars or naked eye and have seen numerous objects over the years. I dont have the best camera but decided to try and take zoomed in photos now and then of objects I have seen. The camera that took the photos in regards to this report is a Digital with zoom that uses a floppy disk for storage. I have debated wheather or not to file this report and submit the photos since I want to be absoultly sure that what is reported is accurate and not a waste of anybodys time.  The only manipulation that I have done on the photos submitted is to invert color & or zoom in & or sharpen in order to try and get the best view possible of the objects. I would love if Mufon or someone could enhance them better. This was a clear sunny day late afternoon. Sitting on my deck looking up at approximately a 60 - 80 degree angle - approximately 5 or 10 degre! es to the west of South. Offutt AFB is 10 - 15 miles to the SE. Millard Airport is 1 mile straight south. Omaha Eppley is 15 miles to the North East.  I was a jet mechanic in the Navy and am quit familiar with military and commericial aircraft. I have learned the incoming and outgoing flight paths for the above facilities.  I am guessing that the objects I observed and took photos of are approximately up around 30 - 40 thousand feet as they were hard to see with the naked eye but able to watch with binoculars and they still appeared to be distant. When I took the photos - I didnt know if the pictures would turn out or not let alone capture anything since the objects seemed so far distance.  The most common factor in the photos is the small green circular light. I first noticed the triangular object (which was hard to distinguish its shape at the time) and took its picture which I was supprised to see the triangular shape and more important to see a cicular area on the bottom o! f the craft which appears to be some sort of propulsion emissi! on. The two object photo - was one object then two, were there and then were gone. I know what I saw, I know what I took pictures of and I know what the pictures are showing I know that the objects are not any type of commericial or military aircraft that I have ever seen before. No matter if you are a skeptic of UFO's or a believer in UFO's as I am - here are the pictures for you to view and decide for yourself what the objects are. Mufon or NuForc are encouraged by me to analyize these photos in depth because I would like to know what they decide the objects in the pictures might be. Mufon or NuForc are welcome to contact me for any additional questions or investigation.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237

Very fast triangle type object;2011-09-12 21:15:00;1 minute;Very fast triangle type object I was on my way home from work tonight, and for the first time ever, I saw something completely unexplainable.  At about 9:15, it moved South East.  I noticed it just over 144th and Pacific area (For people familiar with the area) and if I was to explain what it seemed to look like....  It had a triangle like end  abiout 40 degree angle and a much more gradual triangle on the other end about 20 degrees.  I could not see any details on what it actually looked like as far as color because it was dark, but it had about 5-6 little white/yellow lights and one red light.  Besides the overall shape and complete lack of sound, it was the size of a large airplane and when I noticed it, it was too close not to make a sound.   The lights did not blink but did seem to turn off for a couple seconds and come back on which was also strange.  The most strange thing I noticed was the way it flew, it seemed to go side to side and up in down almost like a kite but still flew am! azingly fast.  Seemed to cross about 5-6 miles in about 30 seconds but didnt seem to move like that. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Originally I was a little skeptical about Aliens and UFO's, but I definitely seen something unusual over downtown Omaha around 7:40 A.M;2014-09-16 07:40:00;45 seconds;Originally, I was a bit skeptical about aliens and UFO's, but I definitely saw something unusual over downtown Omaha at about 7:40 A.M. on September 16, 2014. I was actually coming from Council Bluffs, Iowa.  Everything was very foggy and I seen lights from no where.  I was with someone and they said, That's a UFO.   I originally thought a building was on fire or that an aircraft had exploded.   Shortly after, I begin thinking about the possibilities and explanations of the sighting, the object begin hovering around and more lights begin to turn on.  I would say the sighting lasted about 45 seconds to a min.   After the lights begin to cut off and on it slowly begin to drift east towards Iowa.  The speed of the object begin to pick up, and after I blinked, it was gone.   It wasn't until about 5 minutes after the event did I realize this could have been something that was extraterrestrial.  It was shaped like a diamond though, not the circular traditional shape.   Unfortunately, I don't have pics or video.
