Has fiery tail, triangular windows, fighter escort ...was called space junk by I was walking home along the railroad tracks between the Omaha Stockyards and my apartment in LaVista near Papillion NE, not far from SAC Headquarters in Bellevue. I thought I heard a low rocket noise and looked up. I saw a shimmering trail of white sparks. I gazed at it for awhile and could just make out a shape of some kind that I percieved to be an elongated shape. It was traveling at about 500-1000 feet. I thought I could make out faint triangular shaped windows in a row along the visable side. It was traveling in a North Easterly direction heading towards Millard. The key things that I noted about it was that I could make out a faint engine noise of some kind and that it was traveling very level and straight. It was flying at about the top speed of a single engine Cesna airplane, not very fast but at a good clip. I did gather that it had a rather massive size to it. It was a very big shadow that was darker than the new night sky.  What I also noted was this, I could see that it was being escorted by two other aircraft. I could make out their flashing marker lights. One on each side just slightly ahead of the larger object. I figured that whatever it was, it was being escorted by two fighter jets. Of this I have no doubt.  The next day, a small story was printed in The Omaha World Herald that some Space Junk had fallen and area residents had called in with UFO sightings. It's interesting that  this term space junk was again used later in another sighting in the same Sector of Nebraska. In the report on your site he was told that his Cigar shaped object was also just Space junk....If I ever go to that region of Nebraska again I'll make sure to bring my umbrella...it seems that there must be some sort of magnetic field that attracts all of these level flying space junk objects falling from the sky. I'd really like to see how something falling can attain a level trajectory at about 750ft. That would be cool....here is the info on the related story:   Occurred : 6/1/1992 18:00 (Entered as : 1992 1800)  Reported: 12/5/2002 7:23:37 PM 19:23  Posted: 3/21/2003  Location: Lincoln, NE  Shape: Cigar  Duration:10 min.

Metallic hovering object seen near Offutt AFB, NE.;2001-09-21 14:30:00;05 minutes;Metallic hovering object seen near Offutt AFB, NE. I was dirving down 84th street and noticed a metallic object in the sky near Offutt AFB, NE about 8 miles from where I was and 2,000 ft. in altitude. I thought it was an aircraft, such as a civillian aircraft that was crome ie American Airlines, on approach to Epply Air Field but the object was not moving on a normal approach.  As I pulled into a parking lot, the object appeared to be hovering. This peaking my curosity, I decided to watch this event from a higher elevation in town.  As I was driving closer this object it descended and disappeared from my view, I waited and watched for minutes in a near by park but, never seen a trace, or have a clue of where it went.  I don't believe it was a normal jet aircraft, even a Harrier aircraft does not begin a descent from that altitude.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237

A white aircraft, almost resembling a commercial airliner, vanished before my eyes. The aircraft did not posess normal characteristics.;2009-08-18 18:45:00;30 seconds;A white aircraft, almost resembling a commercial airliner, vanished before my eyes. The aircraft did not posess normal characteristics. I have never experienced an incident in which the sight of something unfamiliar in the sky has compelled me to believe it to be foreign to Earth. However, I do seriously entertain the idea that there is intelligent life elsewhere in the vast depths of space, albeit with a small dose of skepticism. I do not want to jump to the conclusion that what I just encountered was truly an alien aircraft, but it's behavior puzzled me. At around 18:40 PM on Tuesday, August 18th of 2009, I was at work and decided to take a break for a cigarette. I was seated on the loading dock, facing south, when something in the sky caught my eye. The sky was very clear, almost cloudless, and I distinctly saw a white shape, which I first believed to be a normal commercial airplane, traveling west. After further inspection I realized that the object did not resemble any airplane I had seen before, as it had no markings on it. It also didn't have any distinct shading, by that I mean to say that I could not concretely identify any appendages that would normally be visible, such as the wings. It was also traveling at a higher speed than a plane like that normally seems to move. It was quite far away, and I do not have the best eyesight. I could not hear the roar of any engine, but that is most likely due to the distance. Also, there was no cloudy trail left behind in the craft's wake. While I was still inspecting the object, keeping it in my line of sight, it vanished. I got off the loading dock so I could have a better view of sky above me and searched for the object, but I could not find it.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237
