Bright blue fast flashing outer lights and one red fast blinking inner light. This was reported by my wiffe who is a skeptic, but she said many witnesses were present. A few minutes after a police helicopter with search light was combing the area. No local news reports have mentioned anything as of the next day. We would just like to know if anything else was reported in this area. I am a Former Mufon Field investigator and have also rereported this to them.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237
What a way to start September.;2002-09-01 21:30:00;5 minutes;What a way to start September. I went to stand by my window AC unit and looked outside my bedroom window.  I saw this strange light.  It didn't look like an ordinary plane or other flying object.  It was triangular in shape.  When I first saw it, it was just a bright white/clear looking light.  I grabbed my cheap pair of binoculars and began to gaze at the object.  After about a second of looking at it through the binoculars the color changed and suddenly appeared neon green and a redish pinkish color.  It looked really amazing.  Suddenly the street light by my house went out, the lights of the apartment next door turned on, my friends house across the street's lights started going on and off, and the wind picked up and began to blow the trees rapidly about.  The nieghborhood grew quite odd for a few minutes with many wierd things occuring.  The object changed speeds all of a sudden and moved very quickly for about an inch and a half distance (that is it seemed from down here on Earth meaning it must have been miles).  As the object traveled through the sky, it seemed to rotate as it moved, kinda like how the planets rotate in the sky as they orbit the sun.  It was rotating one way and moving another.  There are very tall trees next door. The flying object was blocked from my veiw by the trees.  I could see it through the branches a bit.  I went to my other window hoping it would countinue going straight and appear to me once more, but no such luck.  I believe the object flew over to the other side of my house and was then out of veiw.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237
Two unidentifiable crafts playing over Omaha, that changed color and emitted no sound.;2003-09-03 23:30:00;20 minutes;Two unidentifiable crafts playing over Omaha, that changed color and emitted no sound. I was standing on my deck, facing south. I noticed two objects in the sky near the horizon line. Both appeared to be stationary at first. I thought they were just two planes in the distance, but then thought they were choppers cause they weren't moving. That's when the lights struck me as odd, they didn't blink on and off like on most planes and helicopters. They sort of pulsed from dim to bright like the rythm of a heart beat. And there were a lot more lights on these things than I've ever seen on a plane. I asked my brother to come out and take a look, that's when they started to finally move. One stayed stationary just above the horizon and the other began an upward climb, but it didn't just go straight up. It curved on an arching path up and over the stationary one. I would put money on it being a perfect half circle of motion with the stable craft at the circle's center. After it completed it's trip up and over it started to move in our direction. At this point everyone in my house was on the deck watching. It moved real smooth like it was just gliding across the sky. We were all dead silent, just watching this thing coast toward us. We all swear that it didn't make a sound, I mean nothing. No rotor blades chopping through the air, no propeller sound, not even an engine- just dead quiet. and it just kept going, this thing flew right over my building and we watched it go. The one that had been stationary now started to move off towards the north-east and it glided silently as well, right on out of sight. My family has military background, and I've spent my fair share of time on the flight line, and I have never seen anything like it. the lights on it pulsed and changed color, there was no sound coming from it, and it flew smoother than a falcon catching an updraft.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237
Possible Explination for Lincon, and Omaha, NE sightings;2004-05-31 22:15:00;10 min;Possible Explination for Lincon, and Omaha, NE sightings I was reading where a couple of people had saw a ufo in the vecinity of Omaha, NE from some distance away. I don't know what they saw, but I just would like to let others know, that there are at least 4 civilian airfields around here, and one Air Force Base.  The latter just happens to be the home of STRAT COM. So if viewed from affar, it could look like one of the F-16 were chasing an airliner, and when its After-burners were turned off, the blue tint would seem to vanish. Granted this is not a true report of a sighting, but I saw no other way to contact you to let you know of this.  It would be nice if you had a way to report what might be an explination to some of your reports.  I am not debunking what the people said they saw, just offering one explination for the events they saw thank you for your time;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237

reddish orange lights traveling in same path from Northwest to South in Omaha, NE;2011-10-16 19:30:00;3 min approx;reddish orange lights traveling in same path from Northwest to South in Omaha, NE In Omaha, Ne, on October  16, 2011 approximately 7:30 pm I went outside to move my car from my driveway into the garage.  As I was pulling in I looked up at the sky and noticed a strange light appearing out of the northwest and moving towards the south. It was quite bright and seemed to move very smoothly across the sky.  I first thought it was a plane but it seemed to have too much red and orange colors on it.  As it continued to move south , I grabbed my cell and called my neighbor and told her to come out into her front yard.  When I hung up I saw another light appear out of the Northwest and start moving in the same path as the first.  As the first moved further to the south, I was able to get a better look and it seemed it had fire coming from the bottom of it which caused the orange-ish-redish  color – above the orange it was a bright white but I couldn’t really distinguish a particular shape. Then there was another light appearing out of the northwest (now 3 in total) that started following the same path as the first two – they seemed to all gather in the south hanging suspended.  I tried taking a picture with my cell phone but no luck.  My neighbor was looking as well and trying to take a picture with her cell phone.  I think there were 2 more lights appearing and moving the same direction. I then ran into the house to get my camera and by the time I got back out there, my neighbor said they were “all gone”.  She then asked me if I had seen them form a triangle in the south but I didn’t as I had run into get my camera.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237
50 lights in sky over 72nd street attached to black silhouette.;2012-09-10 21:00:00;15 minutes;50 lights in sky over 72nd street attached to black silhouette. I've lived in Omaha all my life, I've had my share of strange things happen to me but the night I saw this with my mother and friend it changed me, we were pulling out of my mothers driveway when we noticed around 50 lights all spaced out around 15ft apart from each other but moving simultaneously, we decided to follow whatever these things were heading north from 72nd and maple down 72nd street.  Once we got close and I meen literally 40 to 50 feet under it I saw that the lights were attached to a black silhouette of a craft that when it passed by stars they would disappear behind the darkness of this craft, it was bigger than anything I've ever seen in the sky, once it reached crown point on 72nd all the lights disappeared at once and I could no longer see the silhouette either, but the thing is I'm surprised that it wasn't on the news or anything, there were so many people out that night, we couldn't have been the only ones who saw this.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237

Hello, i was looking outside my front house indoor windows when I noticed a big two story shaped UFO it was multiple colors glowing: red, green, orange, yellow, blue and it was glowing different colors really fast one min they all were dark no lights just dark.   I noticed same time this happened it went hyper speed fast to few miles from where it had been, also it was very quiet it was pretty low around lots of witnesses I don't think anyone noticed it.   It was closer to people than you'd expect was just hovering but had activity with lights glowing nearly all at once.  It turned to same color as clouds and disappeared which freaked me out.  I kinda think it sensed me looking and took off.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237

(Within a few milk seconds) my first thought was, ooh a shooting star, but it's green, of course mid thought before I could speak it changed direction loops around in a circle and crashes straight down.  It's 15 miles north of Omaha city limits past HW 75.  We got to see it and snap pictures for all of about 6 minutes after we found where it crashed before military personal from Offuett FAB showed up and told us that it was a federal investigation and we had to leave.  (We were going to try to get a piece of it bit knowing what it was but it was metallic much metal with green and white glow, and it crashed into a 60 year radius hollle in the ground and it was way to hit to approach.  There is no spot for pics on this site, the shape of it looked melted but partially like a pyramid facing up and another pyramid facing down into the same shape and and oval piece of molten iron or uranium or something.
