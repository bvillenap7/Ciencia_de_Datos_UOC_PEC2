Willowcreek Park, Omaha, UFO sighting - June 19,  2009;2009-06-19 21:45:00;20-25 seconds;Willowcreek Park, Omaha, UFO sighting - June 19,  2009 We were at the park around 9:45pm on Friday, June 19, 2009 when the four children we were with started shouting and telling us to look at the “fireball” in the sky.  When we (2 adults) turned to look at where they were pointing (to the east) we saw a fairly large, brightly lit “flying craft” in the sky just above the treetops and houses moving towards us.  I first assumed it was a prop plane flying low, but immediately realized it was not the shape of an airplane (or firework or comet or military plane, etc). It was a boxy-circular shape (somewhat trapezoidal at first), very brightly lit with an orange-yellow light.  The entire craft was covered with a haze that seemed to diffuse the perimeter edges, which is why I can’t put a name to the shape.    There was a brighter spot of light in the center of the object. It was moving towards the park clearing, but when the kids started shouting and pointing the craft stopped moving forward and began to hover.  It hovered for several seconds, and then began moving back – to the east – in the direction that it was originally coming from.  As it got smaller it seemed to change into an elongated oval, then in an instant it was just gone!  Two of the children said it was as if when they started pointing and shouting, the craft “noticed them” and stopped moving towards us.    It was pretty close to us, but there was no noise.  It was totally silent.  In all, we watched it for approximately 20 seconds.  The children saw it for about 5 seconds longer because they saw it first.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237
