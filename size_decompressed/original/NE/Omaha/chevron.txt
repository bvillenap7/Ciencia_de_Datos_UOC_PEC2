Boomerang shape, color hard to describe like hard mist;2011-09-30 21:48:00;1 minute;Boomerang shape, color hard to describe like hard mist My husband was on the phone outside at approx 9:45 PM when spotted it above our house, he banged on the door for me to come out and pointed it out to me.  It was boomerang shaped, the color was very hard to decipher I would describe it as being like a hard shear curtain color, hard mist... very hard to describe.  It was moving very slow, and levitated in one place for about 5 seconds, moved to the right, then continued to move forward (which would be east from our home) then it was gone.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237
Saw a UFO.  ((anonymous report));2018-07-08 20:30:00;10 seconds;Saw a UFO I was driving and I saw a circle looking thing lit with a green light.  It was moving parallel to the ground and at a speed way to fast to be a helicopter of plane. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

I caught direct visual and watched a boomerang shaped craft fly from a NNW to S path.;2019-09-04 00:58:00;7 seconds;Stepped outside before heading to bed.  I was looking up to see if the big dipper was in view that late.  The sky was clear and cloudless. Out of the northern horizon I caught movement.  I caught direct visual and watched a boomerang shaped craft fly from a N-NW to south path.  What I found to be unsettling: dark smoke color, no navigational lights, no sound at all - mid-low altitude, no more than 10,000 feet in altitude.  Speed was alarming as it took 5-7 seconds to cover the direct route.  The shape was nothing I have seen.  It was not a flying wing.  Chevron is close, boomerang is in my opinion the best way to describe.  Thin but congruent, rounded wingtips, no fuselage.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237
