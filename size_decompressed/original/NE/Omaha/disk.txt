The saucer was flying high, with no sound and several lights. It passed overhead.;1982-10-15 21:00:00;2 minutes?;The saucer was flying high, with no sound and several lights. It passed overhead. I am reporting this on behalf of my grandpa, who has related this sighting several times and is serious whenever he states it. He has given permission for me to report it. My grandpa and a friend of his were working in the fields at nightfall in the early '80s, he forgot when. They saw a disk-shaped craft move silently through the air above them at a fast pace. He descirbed it as two saucers put together and stated it had lights around the edges. He was in a truck at the time and his friend was in a tractor, and both saw it. My grandpa is experianced in aeronautics, having been a pilot and a avid aerospace hobbiest. He had no prior belief in UFOs as far as I know and my grandma still does not believe in UFOs, even after his sighting. The next day when he went to work at the plumber's office, he talked to two other friends that told him they were fishing on the Missouri River when they saw a disk shaped object (that they described exactly like the one he saw) pass over them in the general direction of the farm where my grandpa was working. He is absolutely sure it was not a plane, but leaves open the possibility of it being a government aircraft undergoing testing (he lives roughly 25 miles from Offut Airforce base) or a spacecraft.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237
Silver disk flies level across sky, at low altitude, before dusk.;1991-07-01 21:00:00;6-10 minutes;Silver disk flies level across sky, at low altitude, before dusk. It was mid summer in the Early 90's and my father, brother and I were playing catch in our backyard in northwest Omaha.  I was around 9 or 10 at the time.  We all spotted a silver disk flying very slowly to the north or northeast at a low altitude.  It was still daylight out but it was nearing night time, and it was a perfectly clear summer day. We lived close to Interstate 680 and Fort street, and the disk appeared to be floating, maybe 2 to 3 miles beyond the interstate.  I did not see any lights on the craft, but my father thought he saw some.  I simply remember the shape of the craft.  It appeared to have a distinct upper section and a smaller lower section.  Depending on the distance, the craft did not look very large I would have to say it was no larger than 60 feet across and 15 to 20 feet top to bottom.  The disk traveled perfectly level for a long time and made no sound whatsoever.  It then began to speed up and it then passed beyond our vision after about 6 minutes. I remember not knowing what the craft was but thinking it was unique and cool.  I had spent much time at epply airfield because my dad worked there for a long time and I had not only flown on commercial airplanes but I had been near them and seen them close up on the ground many times.  I have never in my 30 plus years seen anything fly where this disk flew. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237
There was not a sound when i was looking at the object or when it left the area as it dissapered;1995-06-13 18:00:00;10 min;There was not a sound when i was looking at the object or when it left the area as it dissapered It was on the night at which the hail bop comet was circling the earth and could be seen through a telescope me and a friend were outside looking at it then i looked at the trees near where me and him were watching the comet and at the tree tops I saw two saucer shaped disks they had lights going around the outer side of the saucer and it hovered there for about 8 min or so.  There was no sound at all.  So i told my friend to come check it out and he got real sacred cause he did not know what it was.  then from out of nowhere a light came from one of the ufo's and my friend watching this with me just was in shock and did not move at all.  then from the woods came a grey creature that had a shape of pear for a head and two of the biggest black eyes that i have ever seen and had no mouth and no reproductive organs.  I had then felt a sharp pain in my head and i could hear the creatures thoughts and feel what it was feeling.  then he turned back after the pain in my head had gone away and the object had vanished before my eyes.  and ever since that day in june through the early days in july I have thoes sharp pains like migraines in my head.  And to this day i have gotten strange calls from people claiming to be from the government.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237

White disc sighted while driving in Omaha.;2005-03-31 13:00:00;30 Seconds;White disc sighted while driving in Omaha. I was driving North on 50th St coming up to the F St. Intersection. Glancing to my right I noticed a white disc shaped object rising up from the tree line at an angle on the horizon moving in a easterly direction. The object moved straight east for a short distance before I lost sight of it behind a large double billboard. Slowing the car down I caught sight of it again just past F St. as  50th St. dips to head steeply down towards a tunnel. The object made a very quick turn and headed north just before I lost sight of it again due to the dip in the terrain. I went through the tunnel and under the interstate 80 bridge. I tried to spot the object again as I came up the hill on the other side. I was unable to get a good look at the portion of the sky where I had seen the object until I came up to Grover St. due to the amount of trees and homes blocking my view. When I got to the Grover St. intersection and looked around the sky as I waited for the green light. The object was nowhere to be seen. The Object was a smooth briliant white. It had no wings. Its movements were quick yet gracefull. Ive purchased a pocket sized digital camera as a result of this sighting. If I see anything like this again I will be ready to photograph it.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237
Bowl or saucer shaped craft in a playground;2011-02-21 18:48:00;2 minutes;Bowl or saucer shaped craft in a playground I was sitting at the dinner table with my children, who did NOT witness this.  I had a clear view out of my livingroom window from this vantage point, and saw what I assumed was a reflection of my saucer-shaped livingroom light fixture.  I didn't pay it much attention until I saw this 'reflection' increase in brightness.  It began to project beams of light to the ground, from its perimeter.  After a few seconds, the beams retracted back into the craft and individual lights around the outside of it began to blink out in a circular pattern until nothing was left visible.   At this point, I ran to the window and could see nothing.  The craft was across the street from my house, to the left of a small storage shed at a playground.  There was nothing in this area that could have made any sort of light, muchless a display like what I saw.  I noticed that from where I was sitting, my livingroom light does not reflect in this window at all.. and even if it had, the c! raft was shaped like an upside down shallow bowl, and my light fixture is not turned in this manner.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237
Disappearing object.;2012-11-11 14:20:00;30 seconds;Disappearing object While I was stopped at a red light, something in the sky caught my eye.  There was a cylindrical shapped object which was flying to the south.  Due to the reflection of the sun I was able to determine that this object was cylindrical in shape.  It then stopped moving from what I could tell.  At the very moment it stopped it became an extremely bright white and simply disappeared.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237
Omaha UFO seen floating above building;2015-09-09 01:00:00;~5 minutes;Omaha UFO seen floating above building I was in my living room on my phone, I was looking out to see the weather and then I see something above (what I think is a government building), it was floating there for a good minute or so, it was twinkled like a star but it was orange/red and way too close to be a star.   Then it started to move real slow away from the building, I looked away for one second then poof, it was gone. I'm a 16 year old highschooler, and I accidentally fell asleep all evening, which is why I was up at 1am.  I wish we could post pictures because I took some but oh well.

Row of 20 or so lights evenly spaced over night sky;2020-11-04 19:00:00;2 minutes;Row of 20 or so lights evenly spaced over night sky We were looking toward the Southern sky at Jupiter and Saturn when we saw this row of 20 or so stars in a line evenly spaced from the south to west.  We realized these were not stars as they were moving slowly from South to West keeping an even spacing.  This went on for a minute or two then they all disappeared.;41.2571212025319;-96.033373312237
