Multicolored flashing light - object;2012-08-30 23:44:00;Still Going;Multicolored flashing light - object I am watching the sky from Hampton Nebraska looking north and slightly east. The object is about 30 degrees above the horizon. It appears stationary, but is rapidly flashing lights, the colors include blue, red, green, and gold.  I am using binoculars, but I cannot get a good view of what it can be, appears to be just a multicolored flashing object. The colors are flashing one after the other but they do not seem to be in any order, or in any particular repitition, but the flashes vary in duration.  I have seen these before, but never this bright or close. These are definately not FAA lights, I am very familiar with those.;40.926;-97.8881
