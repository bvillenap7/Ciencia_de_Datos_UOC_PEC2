Eight big, bright lights in a row.  ((NUFORC Note:  Starlink satellites?  PD));2019-11-21 16:45:00;1 minute;Eight big, bright lights in a row Driving north there were 8 brights lights in the sky.  At first I checked to see if they were lights in a field but my view was too high as I was driving.  As soon as I slowed down one by one they disappeared.  They were in a long line and it gave me the feeling of something big because of their size and brightness.  This is the second occurrence that I have had in the last 10 years.  The time before I thought  something was going to land on the highway as I was driving and then the lights moved up and disappeared;41.6926;-97.6711
