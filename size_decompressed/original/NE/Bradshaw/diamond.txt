I witnessed it flash about four times, moving very quickly to the east with each flash.  Disappeared or became outside of my view at that point.  A plane would not be able to get out of view so quickly.  The lines were very clean and bright.  May have been similar to two interlocked triangles, very large in size.  Object was low in the sky.
