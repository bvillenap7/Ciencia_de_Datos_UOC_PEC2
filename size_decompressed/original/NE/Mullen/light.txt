For the last 4 nights after work my boyfriend and I have been going home and have seen lights bouncing, making loups, and all sorts of strange monevers. The first night we saw it, it was very close I got scared and we started to go it kept up with our car at perfect speed until we reached town and then went back up into the sky where we watched it move around for several hours. The last two nigts we have also seen this. Last night 11-9-2002 we saw at least five the lights seemed to be red-white-and blue until we looked into the video camera and it was an assortment of all colors changing very fast every few seconds it would let of something and the screen would be blury.  We watched this for several hours again and it was still there when we left.  I have this on video showing it moving at incredible speeds and changing colors rapidly. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witnesses observed, but we feel that satellites and twinkling stars would be the first possibility we would like to have ruled out as possible candidates.
