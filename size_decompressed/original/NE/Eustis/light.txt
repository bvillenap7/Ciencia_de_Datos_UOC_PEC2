dancing lights in the sky;2007-08-19 10:15:00;still going;dancing lights in the sky we seen at least 5 lights coming and going from different directions east northeast from eustis like they were playing in the sky. it was first noticed around 10:15 pm and is 11:02 and is still there.  for a little while around 10 minutes the lights changed to long oblong lights that seemed to have a pattern and then they changed back to the way they were before and are just darting all over the sky in one area. they don't seem to be too far up in the atmosphere and are like all over and just keep going.  they seem luminated not too bright like they are hazy.  they are still going but we need to go to bed.  don't know if anyone else has seen this but if they do they will be amazed and curious.  thank you;40.6663;-100.0253
