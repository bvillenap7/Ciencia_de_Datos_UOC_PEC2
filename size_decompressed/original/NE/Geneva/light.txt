one bright object which turned into eleven;2000-09-10 18:30:00;15sec.;one bright object which turned into eleven It started with a bright orange or firey colored light which got dimmer then went out and then started brightagain and then got dimmer then went out. The object did this about 4 times , then the fifth time it apeared there were about eleven of them , only alot smaller and were in kind of formation then they just dissapeard, this whole event lasted about fifteen seconds. It was hard to tell how close it was, but to me it looked like it was a mile to a mile and a half away from me, which was south east of me just after the sun had gone down, you could just start seeing a few stars. The main object was round , i had my binoculars on it for the last single bright object and when it turned into 11 objects. The object really didnt look any different except brighter. I talked to a few other people that said they saw it also.;40.5312;-97.6055
