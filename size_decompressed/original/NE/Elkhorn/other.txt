Bright blue light in the night sky traveling at terrific speed;2012-02-11 23:10:00;1-2 seconds;Bright blue light in the night sky traveling at terrific speed On the way home from work, on a road I travel every night after my shift. East bound on 64 just west of Elkhorn NE a bright blue light came up from behind me in the night sky.  It passed me at incredible speed, and disappeared in a cloud bank.  I would say in was traveling many times the speed of sound.  It was a half moon in shape,  with the straight edge trailing. I am a 61 year old factory worker with a sound mind, and above average intelligence. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
