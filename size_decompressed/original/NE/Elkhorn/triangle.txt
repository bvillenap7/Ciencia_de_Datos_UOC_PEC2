V shaped object wih dim lit circles;2006-11-18 23:30:00;5 sec.;V shaped object wih dim lit circles At 23:30 PM I was out looking for the meteor shower on my deck.  I noticed coming out of the North moving South an object that appeared to be a fast moving translucent dim lit spot.  As it came closer and passed overhead, I could make out round dim lit circles and a triangle shaped shadow looking object.  It appears to be the same type of object that was reported in Hutchinson, KS on Oct. 27th on your site, and bears a resemblence to the Sandy, UT sighting.  The object was moving faster than anything I have seen in the sky.  I first caught sight of it at 45 deg. above the North horizon and kept it in my sight until it reached 60 deg. above the South horizon.  It traveled this long distance in 5 seconds.  The round circles wee so dim lit that they looked like light gray shadows moving across the sky.;41.2766999999999;-96.2434
