Two sightings within 5 days over Grand Island, Nebraska;2001-05-27 23:15:00;10-15 seconds;Two sightings within 5 days over Grand Island, Nebraska From my west window, around 11:15 at night, I observed a circular craft traveling from west to east very fast, about 10 seconds from far horizon to passing over head and to the right of my window. Circular view from below.  As it passed, smaller lights were dancing over its underside.  The TV show AMZ did a segment on UFO's and the one they showed looked like the object.  A few days before this sighting, I think , I saw the same object in the sky again about 11:15 at night. It was moving slow and changing directions with uneven motion, slightly northwest of the west window.  observed with binoculars, faint, detected mainly because of its motion.;40.9274040186913;-98.3797135514034
