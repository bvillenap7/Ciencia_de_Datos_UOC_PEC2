I was a hovering sphere over the corn field near my house.;1985-05-01 19:00:00;20 - 30 seconds;I was a hovering sphere over the corn field near my house. One night when I was about 10 years old I went out my back door. I was getting ready to go to a cub scout meeting. As soon as I stepped out my back door, I noticed a bright sphere-shaped object hovering (not even really hovering, it was just perfectly still) maybe 500 feet or less over the corn field near my house. The sphere was about 1500 - 2000 feet in total away from me (in a straight line.) I was totally shocked. I had never seen anything like it. Even at 10 years old I knew it was not an airplane or a helicopter. It made no noise whatsoever. I was overcome with the feeling that the object was staring straight at me. I can't explain this, it's just something I knew was happening. I also had the sense that I couldn't look away. It was a very, very peaceful feeling, I felt very happy, more so than the moments before I stepped out the door. It was as though the object was telling me it's ok, don't worry. Very strange but that is the overwhelming feeling I had.  The sphere wasn't very big. Maybe about 50 - 75 feet across. It was emitting light, but the light didn't really light up the night. There were no beams of light coming off it, but still it was as though it was shining a flashlight straight at my eyes. The light was white, all white. This lasted maybe 20 seconds and as I said was a very joyful feeling.  Then suddenly, the light shot off across the sky at an extremely high rate of speed. It didn't have to speed up. It reached the full speed I saw it traveling at instantly. It travelled east toward Grand Island and in the distance it arched upward slightly and disappeared.  I'll never forget this as long as I live. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD));40.9274040186913;-98.3797135514034
I wish that I could see them, I aim camera btween the chem trails and the sun and photograph them regularly.;2017-10-21 14:00:00;During eclipse;I wish that I could see them, I aim camera btween the chem trails and the sun and photograph them regularly. I work in this area, this happened during the totality of the Sept.21 solar eclipse.We took a few hrs. off to observe. It started when I was talking to another individual that happened to see a flash of orange to the north.  I had my phone in my hand, so I snapped some shots to the North.  I then turned partially around and continued the conversation.  I began taking snapshots facing the opposite direction over my left shoulder toward the sun.  The sun was under the effect of the 2 minute totality, practically dark. I did not see or hear anything out of the ordinary.  When I got home that evening and started going through the pictures, I could have fainted.  What I filmed and what I was seeing was two totally different things. The chemtrails were blatant that day.  They started that morning and continued until right before the event.  Practically created full cloud cover and darkened the sky.  They continue to this day and I continue to take pictures capturing the spheres on film.  I do not know how to get the word out or where to report the incidents. I have no idea what they are after.  I do know that they are very busy and continues to grow in numbers and frequency.  My last pics were taken just yesterday.;40.9274040186913;-98.3797135514034
