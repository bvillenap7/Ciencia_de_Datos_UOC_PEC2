Fireballs in Sky;2001-12-01 22:15:00;5 minutes;Fireballs in Sky I saw 5 groups of 10 fireballs each flying in diamond formation W to E while driving on a country road west of Grand Island Nebraska about 10:15 on the night of Dec. 1.  Each was reddish orange elipitcal shapped with tails. The formations formed a larger diamond formation.  There was no sound as they passed overhead.  They flew in a straight line and never veried in formation or speed.  I phoned my mother and she and my brother ran outside and also saw several of the objects.  After the objects disappeared, I tried to follow in my car, but never again caught sight of them.
