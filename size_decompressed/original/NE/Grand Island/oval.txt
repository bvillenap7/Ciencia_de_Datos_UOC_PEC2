We were taking our dog for a walk and just happened to notice these two lights coming out of the South East sky. They flew silently over us to the North West. One was a little ahead of the other and then the slower one caught up.  They were not as high as an airplane would be.  We watched them until they finally disappeared.  We have never seen anything like this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witnesses provides no contact information.  PD));40.9274040186913;-98.3797135514034
