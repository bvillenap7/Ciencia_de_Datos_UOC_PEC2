They seemed randomly timed and spaced, but in the same general area.  As I was observing this phenomenon, I noticed a dimly lit orange object approaching from extremely high speed from the north, flying directly south.  It was approximately 20,000 feet in altitude and moving approximately four or five times the speed of normal jet.  I would estimate it's length to be 500 feet.  It was huge. It travelled from horizon to horizon in about eight seconds, and appeared to curve towards the east as it left.  It was shaped like a four leaf clover. with the two outside leaves approximately twice as big as the front and back leaves.  The front and back leaves were more elongated, the outside more round.  The object had a faint orange glow with dimmer half circle areas on the outside leaves.  It made absolutely no sound.   Two jets flew over in the same path in formation at the same altitude approximately five minutes later.  I could distinctly hear them, and I also noted that they seemed extremely slow and small compared with the orange object.  I noticed much more air traffic than normal in the area for about an hour after the event.;41.8229;-103.6639
