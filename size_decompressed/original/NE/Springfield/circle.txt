The Object flew low to the ground and if it would have been an airplane there would have been a considerable amount of noise.  It was large and disk-like had red and blue lights.  It flew over where we were standing, not in a straight path but not quite a zig-zag, weaving back and forth.  It headed away from our location and then began flying perpendicular at about the speed of an airplane.  It then almost came to a stop, moving very slowly in the same direction.  It then gained speed and continued on the perpendicular course until no longer visible.;41.0765000000001;-96.1437999999999
