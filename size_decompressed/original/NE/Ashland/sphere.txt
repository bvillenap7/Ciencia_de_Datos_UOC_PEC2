Watched a bright green glowing sphere travel across a field.;2016-10-27 23:45:00;10 seconds;Watched a bright green glowing sphere travel across a field. At approx.. 11:45 PM, as I approached a T on a gravel road and made the turn, I saw a bright green glowing sphere traveling across the field.  It was not going very fast, maybe 15-20 mph and it was about 10-15 feet off the ground. It followed the contour of the land and I was driving parallel to it at about 75 feet away.   The sphere was about 1 Â½ to 2 feet in diameter and very bright neon green.  My first thought was that it was some type of fireworks, but it made no sound and did not seem to be affected by gravity as it followed the land contour, so it was not fireworks.  I lost sight of it when the hill at the edge of the road blocked my view.   I stopped my car and turned off my lights and watched for about 10 minutes, but saw nothing else.     I also returned the next night at 11:30 and watched the field for a half hour, but saw nothing.;41.0583;-96.3937
