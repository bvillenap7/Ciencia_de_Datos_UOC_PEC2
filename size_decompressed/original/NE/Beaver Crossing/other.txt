Black flying object beside our van...;2003-10-03 22:45:00;30 sec-1 min;Black flying object beside our van... My husband and I were driving north from Hwy 6 headed to I-80. An approx 6 ftx6 ft  (but shaped more like an octagon) flying black object came flying beside our van from the west, I could not see the whole object, but it appeared to undulate as it flew within arms length from our vehicle.  No noise was heard from the object, but it scared the daylights out of us.  A car was coming over the hill towards us from the north, and the object fly straight up, and was gone. Our estimated speed prior to the appearance of the object was 60 mph, which increased to 80 mph in our panic of the object.  It stayed right next to the van for 30-45 seconds but it seemed like longer. We went back to where the object had been next to us, to try to locate the object.  We wanted to be sure it was not a piece of dark plastic, cardboard or something that could be explained.  We drove back and forth down that stretch of road partially in the ditch searching and could not find anything that could explain what had just happened.;40.787;-97.2865
