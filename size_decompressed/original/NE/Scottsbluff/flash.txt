Bright flash of light followed by trail.;2009-08-31 00:05:00;30 seconds;Bright flash of light followed by trail About 30 minutes ago, I was walking to my car outside my apartment building and I saw a bright flash fill up the sky.  At first I thought it was lightning because it was kind of muggy out but when I turned around to see if it might be I looked up and I saw a bright trail of light that slowly dissipated. The trail of light lasted about 30 seconds and disappeared.  When it did it vanish the trail was going from south west to north east.   I am a 31 year old male and grew up in this region.  I have seen this one other time when I was about 17 in a town about 90 miles east of where I am now.  I am a high school and college graduate.;41.8728118343196;-103.661087573965
