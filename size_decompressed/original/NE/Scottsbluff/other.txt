Driving SB from Scottsbluff, NE towards Kimball, noticed what looked like one very orange star next to the moon, after observation, appeared to be anywhere from one to five orange stars clustered to the moon, curious, we photographed the moon.  When picture was downloaded on computer, orange stars weren't visible, HOWEVER down below the moon is a perfectly round white circle and off to the right are also strange circular shapes which weren't seen by us at all when we were observing the moon.  Whats strange is when you zoom in on the lower circle you can see an almost perfect looking triangle in the middle, zoom back out and the circular shaes to the right almost appear to be trails (?) of the lower, smaller circle.  Someone said it was probably a star but I tried to take photos of stars later and they do not look like these circular shapes.  Later we recalled dashboard lights had blinked off three seperate times on the new veicle we were driving. ((NUFORC Note:  Probably Mars.  Please see other reports.
