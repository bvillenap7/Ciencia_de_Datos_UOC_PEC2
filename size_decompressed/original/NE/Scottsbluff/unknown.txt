We took some pictures of both north and south lookout points. My friend looked through his picture takes that night and he discovered something that may be an UFO. That photo was taken at the north lookout point. He did not see the UFO when he took this photo. We were unable to positively identify it. Look at 3 pictures below.  This is an original picture. My friend discovered something in the upper right corner area.  So I cropped it see below. This part of photo was cropped from the original. So I cropped it even more see below. Grayish bottom, blue rim.  What is it?  There is the sun reflection in the middle of the rim. Can't I paste photos on this form???;41.8728118343196;-103.661087573965
