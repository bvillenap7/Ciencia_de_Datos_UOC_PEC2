Western Nebraska white-blue round light;2006-08-18 21:10:00;1½ min.- 2½ mins;Western Nebraska white-blue round light We noticed a white, round light with a blueish outerglow in the Northeast sky at approx. 2 o'clock on a North arrow. It lasted for a duration of 1½ - 2½ minutes descending appoximately 50 degrees in the sky. The light dimmed after descending 40 degrees then brightened briefly and then dimmmed out completely. The line of sight was unobstructed by any trees or clouds in the sky. There was a tree to the left of the object that we were able to tract how far the light was descending. There was no sound. The light was 10 times bigger than any other star in the sky. We were standing underneath a street light and quite shocked when we noticed the unusual behavior of the light. We then blocked the street light out of our vision with our hands and noticed the other stars in the sky. It was not a plane or satellite as first two osbervers have seen both on numerous occassions in the night sky. The third and fourth observers only viewed the light for the last 20-30 seconds to watch it descend, dim and disappear.  Backgrounds: 1st observer: Graphic artist, very detail oriented, raised with a powerful telescope and a knowledge of astronomy. Has witnessed UFOs in the Sandhills of Nebraska on a few occassions.

Fast moving UFO with 90 degree right turn around Scottsbluff, NE;2011-09-13 22:15:00;10 - 20 seconds;Fast moving UFO with 90 degree right turn around Scottsbluff, NE I was driving home from Wyoming to Western Nebraska at about 10:15PM Mountain time. A bright light, about the size of a bright star moved quickly across the sky from west to east. I was driving east on Highway US 26. The object caught my eye when I noticed it through the front windshield. It looked like a satellite, only moving much, much faster, and brighter.  After moving almost towards the eastern horizon, the light stopped for a split second, then made a roughly 90 degree turn to the right, and sped off very fast to the south and disappeared from view on the southern horizon (or at least behind one of the many large rock features that are around the area). There was a full moon outside, and most of the visible stars in the sky were obscured by moonlight. The light was VERY bright, white in color with an almost slight green hue.  The sky at the time of the event was clear, although we did have some rain earlier in the evening. The entire event took about 10 seconds (seemed much longer). I am highly educated (Doctoral degree), and work in public service.  I was completely sober, and was wide awake and aware. As a side note, I felt right after the sighting a butterflies in the stomach feeling, and felt a feeling akin to the object knew that I observed it. I can't explain the feeling in words that properly describe the emotional experience.  Again, very, very strange. I have never experienced anything like this before, and frankly, I found fascinating, exciting and disturbing.  Especially once I had some time to digest what happened. I felt compelled to make a report.  Unfortunately, I didn't get a photo or video.  The experience simply happened to fast to get my phone out of my pocket... In the future, I am going to have my phone out and in the cup holder! -grin-;41.8728118343196;-103.661087573965
