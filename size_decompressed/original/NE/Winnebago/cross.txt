Bright white shaped cross moving east then up;2010-07-09 22:00:00;2 minutes;Bright white shaped cross moving east then up Me and my girlfriend were getting out of the car at about 10:30pm when I got out I looked up and out toward the eastern sky,and I noticed what looked like a a star in the shape of a cross ,about a little brighter than the north star. I told my girlfriend to look at it and she said is that an airplane, I told her it didn't have any of the flashing marker lights.We kept watching it move toward the east at a slow rate of speed .Then it seemed to stop and what appeared to start to move away and toward the outer sky and slowly fade away.;42.2369;-96.465
