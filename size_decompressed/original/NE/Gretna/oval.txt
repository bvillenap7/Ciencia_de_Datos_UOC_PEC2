Large oval shaped UFO West of Gretna, NE;2020-07-04 21:10:00;10-15 minutes;Large oval shaped UFO West of Gretna, NE It was off in the distance, West of Gretna, NE, by at least 20 miles, but it was still huge in the sky . It was oval as an outline but the center seemed to be open.  It was not smoke or clouds because it remained stationary for at least 10-15 minutes.  I tried taking a picture of it, but the pictures didn't turn out very clear because it was so far away.;41.1345;-96.2458
