Three red dots in a triangular pattern appeared in the sky and disappeared shortly after.  ((anonymous report));2018-11-03 23:00:00;1 minutes;Three red dots in a triangular pattern appeared in the sky and disappeared shortly after. I was driving home and felt a strange presence (scarier this time).  I looked up into the sky as if expecting it and moments later the craft appeared ahead of me in the sky.  Three red dots.  Really far away this time but definitely not stars.  It stayed for a moment and then when I reached a certain point in the road (this always happens) it disappeared.  It seems harmless and there was only one this time.  I don't know why they are watching or following me.  I am not always afraid by them - one time I saw four of them- they follow me down Lincoln Road. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
