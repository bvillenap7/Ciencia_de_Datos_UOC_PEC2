“Brightest landing lights I’ve ever seen.”;2021-02-16 03:32:00;60 minutes plus;“Brightest landing lights I’ve ever seen.” Just wondering, but out towards Scottsbluff there’s a noticeably bright, ultra bright, light. Being this is late, I don’t believe this is a planet setting on the horizon. Doesn’t appear to be a meteor, because it’s not moving. Maybe space debris reentering from orbit, but would it just hang like that? A weapon launch, or a flare, or some kind of denotation? Too big to be a flare. Anyway, my husband says it’s the brightest landing lights he’s ever seen.;41.6797;-103.0735
