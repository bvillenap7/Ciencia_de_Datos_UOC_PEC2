It was a clear night and we were on a freight train heading north.  First I saw a cone shaped object shoot across the sky back and forth once.  Then it stopped and stayed in one place with a glow to it.   Then all at once it looked like a small explosion and it was gone.   When this all was going on, the work radio went on the fritz and didn't work till it was gone.;41.8393;-96.4713
