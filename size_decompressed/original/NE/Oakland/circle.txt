Around 9:45 pm my brother and I observed a round white ball moving west to east in the southern sky.  The object moved at a fairly slow speed.  The white light was constant, not blinking.  After about 1 minute the white light turned and started  moving in a southeasterly direction, when it turned to the southeast it began to wobble some.  It still was moving at a slow speed until it disappeared.   When the white ball wobbled we knew it was not a plane or satellite.;41.8393;-96.4713
