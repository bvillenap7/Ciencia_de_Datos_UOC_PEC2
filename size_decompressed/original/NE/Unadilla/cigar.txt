Cigar shaped object flying above cirrus clouds;1985-03-15 14:30:00;20 seconds;Cigar shaped object flying above cirrus clouds It was a March day ,light winds, high cirrus clouds, sunny. I walked from my house to another building at my farm. When I entered the threshold of the doorway I stopped, turned around 180 degress, and looked straight up, why I did this is puzzeling , because then at that moment I saw a silver cigar shaped object, flying  above the cirrus clouds at twice the speed of a commercial jetliner at that altitude. There were no wings, no con trail,  the cigar shaped object flew from the north due south. I observed this object for about 20 seconds as it clearly was visible in and out of the cloud openings. I know cirrus clouds are usually about 30,000 feet. so I know this cigar shaped object was very large. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.
