NEW YEARS DAY SURPRISE;2003-01-01 02:00:00;3 OR 4 MINUTES;NEW YEARS DAY SURPRISE I OPENED MY FRONT DOOR, WHICH FACES SOUTH, TO GET A BREATH OF FRESH AIR.  I NOTICED STRAIGHT AHEAD (SOUTH) A LIGHT THAT SEEMED TO BE GETTING LARGER, AND SEEMED TO BE MOVING CLOSER. I GOT SCARED, AND QUICKLY SHUT THE DOOR. THINKING THAT I MUST HAVE MADE A MISTAKE IN WHAT I SAW, I REOPENED THE DOOR, AND SAW THAT THE LIGHT WAS GETTING BRIGHTER AND CHANGING COLORS FROM A YELLOWISH REDDISH LIGHT TO A BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT.  IT WAS MOVING IN A NORTHERLY DIRECTION, AND JUST WHEN I THOUGHT IT WOULD GET CLOSER, IT TURNED HEADING WEST, AND THAT'S WHEN I NOTICED THE VERY DARK OBJECT THAT I COULD JUST MAKE OUT THE SHAPE AS BEING DISC SHAPED. IT WAS MOVING VERY SLOWLY, AND DIDN'T MAKE A SOUND.  I THOUGHT THAT MAYBE IT WAS A BLIMP, BUT EVEN BLIMPS MAKE A SOUND WHEN IT GETS NEAR, AND THIS THING DIDN'T.  I STOOD AND WATCHED THIS 'THING' UNTIL I LOST SIGHT OF IT OVER THE TREE TOPS. I WATCHED THE NEWS, AND LISTENED TO THE RADIO BUT NEVER DID I HEAR OF A SIGHTING, OR PEOPLE SEEING SOMETHING STRANGE. MAYBE PEOPLE WERE STILL CELEBRATING NEW YEAR'S EVE TO NOTICE. I WILL SAY THAT THERE IS AN UNITED STATES AIR FORCE BASE LESS THAN A MILE AWAY!;41.1337037037037;-95.9312777777778
