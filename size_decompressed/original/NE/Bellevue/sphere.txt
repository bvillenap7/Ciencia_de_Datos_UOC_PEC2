Very unusual craft seen over Bellevue NE, headed for Offutt.;2011-09-30 21:00:00;1 hour;Very unusual craft seen over Bellevue NE, headed for Offutt. While hanging out with a couple of buddies I noticed some hovering very close to the ground approximately 5 miles north of us, at first we thought it off thinking it was a police helicopter.  A couple of minutes later I glanced back in that direction, saw that it was still in the same location, then i saw it drop several small objects that appeared to be blinking red. I pointed it out to my buddies and they saw it as well, so we decided to watch it.  Pretty soon we notice it getting closer until it passed us about 100 feet to the east, it was coasting about 200 feet in the air, very quiet emitting a very soft and low pitched noise, I'd say it was moving about 75 miles per hour.  It look like a dark colored orb with three bright white lights (one on each side and one on the very front, it also had a green light which came on and looked like a laser but could only see it until it got about 20 feet away from the craft and it was changing direction and seem to be m! oving around the surface of it.   After passing us it turned east headed for Offutt air force base, we tryed to follow it all roads into the area of the base were closed, and we lost it.;41.1337037037037;-95.9312777777778

It was outside and pretty high up in the sky but not too high. It made a weird crinkling noise like plastic being crumpled up. It just sat there and didnt move but right before it left it made a pop sound and went away so fast you could  barely see it leave.;41.1337037037037;-95.9312777777778
