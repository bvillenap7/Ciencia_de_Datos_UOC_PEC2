Black Tear Drop Shape over Offut Air Force Base.;2000-08-20 08:00:00;10 seconds;Black Tear Drop Shape over Offut Air Force Base. The week before the airshow (Thunder in the Heartland Aug 26-28) at Offut Air Force Base, while taking children to school I observed a black tear-drop shaped silhouette aprox 1-5 miles away.It appeared from behind the trees and disappear behind another set of trees. The craft was flying slowly from the SW to the South. The teardrop shape was oriented so that the smaller pointed end was the front of the aircraft. It gave me the impression of being slow and ponderous. I did not observe any tail section, propellors or rotors. Since it was a side-on silhouette I would not have been able to observe any wings. As it flew behind the trees I pointed it out to the driver of the vehicle I was in. We waited for it to come out from behind the trees but, it never did. ((NUFORC Note:  Given that the sighting occurred close to an Air Force base, our first consideration would be that the witness might have observed an aircraft. Since the sighting occurred just days before an air show seems to emphasize such a possibility.  The shape of the object is reminiscent of the fuselage of a Hughes 500-series helicopter.  However, that is only a guess.  We will attempt to pin down the precise date of the sighting.  PD));41.1337037037037;-95.9312777777778
