The strange and perhaps frightening thing was they both appeared out of no where and we both were in awe. The one elevated above the other one really and I mean extremely slowly , then all of a sudden we seen both of them in what appeared to be targeting our balcony in which we were standing with red lasers. We both couldn't even move nor talk to one another at that time , it was like we were in shock. These red lasers were not pin lasers by any means and they moved on the edge of our balcony as well as landing on each of us. As soon as we looked down and seen these red laser balls on our bodies they disappeared as well as both rectangular objects in the night sky. This took place right around midnight and lasted no more than 15 minutes , furthermore the same night while laying in bed trying to sleep after what we just witnessed we seen a red laser on our bed move and bounce around yet nothing outside as we both jumped and looked out our window. Now I understand this sounds off the wall , however we both are very educated people and we called no one over the mere fact we fear someone would think we were totally crazy.;41.1337037037037;-95.9312777777778

It blazed across the sky and got closer and closer.  Next thing I know it was a couple hundred feet away from me.  It appeared invisible but I could see a very very thin outline and on each corner of the rectangle there was a bright  white light on each corner and in the front(?)  Of the craft there was 2 smaller yellow lights closer to eachother.  The craft appeared to be cloaked or just happened to be the same exact color as the dark blue dusk sky.  It made a quiet noise once it was hovering over the field right by my car.  The noise is best described as similar to an airplane but much much quieter.  This happened to be about a mile from the air force base.  So, could have been something from there.;41.1337037037037;-95.9312777777778
