At first they had a bluish hue to them.   I thought that they were spot lights of some kind but began to realize the lights were actually coming from behind the clouds.  They were flying at a great speed.  The flight path was pretty repetitive but at times they would fly in a irregular pattern.  They would also fly at different altitudes throughout their orbit.  After about 10 mins 3 of the lights trailed off and only two were left. At this point the lights lost their blue color and became more silver/white.  I called my neighbor and his fiance to come and look at them also in order to make sure that someone else witnessed this event other than myself.  It is possible that it was spot lights but the  light appeared to be coming from behind the clouds and it definitely was not a regular aircraft.   Also the flight path was not how an automated spot light wo! uld move.  The airspace in which the lights were located was a barren field where there is nothing but farm land.  I believe they were probably flying in close proximity of the Iowa-Nebraska border.     Another thing to note is that the area that this occurred was very close to a major US Air Base.;41.1337037037037;-95.9312777777778
UFO near Offutt AFB in NE.;2021-08-05 22:32:00;25;UFO near Offutt AFB in NE. Few miles away from Offutt AFB while at a drive in movie. Coming back from the concessions areas my son I witnessed the object. We could not make out shape other than a light in the distance, object was moving uncharacteristically (i.e. not like an airplane, helicopter, or even a drone (was aloft for too long)) and moved in multiple directions very quickly. No no flashing lights like a regular aircraft would. In examination of our 20ish minutes of video (poorly shot on an iPhone 10X max which made everything appear much further away), light appears to be rotating.  Was joined for a short while by a second light, but was gone quickly.;41.1337037037037;-95.9312777777778
