Silent craft flying extremely low dropping flaming embers;1995-07-01 04:30:00;1 minute;Silent craft flying extremely low dropping flaming embers I was located less than a mile north of Offutt AFB (Nebraska) in a grocery store parking lot on Highway 370 when I noticed 'fire' in the sky to the north of my location. Upon further inspection, it appeared to be moving very slowly with flaming embers falling from the bottom. There was not any sound associated with the craft and I feared it was a jet crashing. However, it didnt lose any altitude and continued traveling westward until I couldnt see it. I never heard any crash sound and there were no reports of downed aircraft from the base. The details of the event are sketchy for me because I didn't write them down. I didn't really think much about it until I heard another report describing the flaming embers. I dont remember any lights associated with the craft other than the embers. It was flying lower than the top of a water tower to the west of my location. I am certified as a weather observer/forecaster and have extensive experience watching the night time sky, though this is what I would consider my first UFO encounter. I just assumed it was an unannounced military aircraft.;41.1337037037037;-95.9312777777778

I was standing outside watching the sky when I saw a group of red and white lights. The lights were blinking as they seemed to jump around or fly erratically. I watched it for about a minute when it just disappeared.;41.1337037037037;-95.9312777777778

We started seeing things going across the sky. Some could possably been satellites and a couple were shooting stars but some i don't know what they were. You would catch a flash then it would go across the sky like a plane but moving at a high rate of speed very high up and there was no tail.;41.1337037037037;-95.9312777777778
