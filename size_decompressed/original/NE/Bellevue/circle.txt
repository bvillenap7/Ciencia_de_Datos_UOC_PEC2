A Sphere or Cirle As bright as a star hover atleast 40-60,000 Ft.;1999-05-13 19:00:00;1 hour;A Sphere or Cirle As bright as a star hover atleast 40-60,000 Ft. I was sitting on my parent's back porch watching a plane traveling North to South when I saw a bright light in the sky. At first I thought it was a star, but it was 19:00 hrs, with the sun well above the horizon.  It was too early to be seeing stars.  So I got a pair of field glasses and got a better look.  It was a bright circle with something dark brown or red on one side of the circle.  During the course of my observations I saw several commercial aircrafts travel at appox. 30-40,000 ft,  It appeared that this object was well above this altitude.  I was able to observe the object for approx. 1 hr.  Both my parents also witnessed the object.  It could have been a weather balloon,  I've  never seen one before.  But my guess is you wouldn't be able to observe one for that long.  Nor would it be as large as I would think this object must have been.  My guess is 2-3 times larger than a airliner.  Eventually I saw it disappear like a light going out.  During the course of the 1hr. the object did travel some distance across the sky, no more that 3 fists from an extended arm. Personal biography: This is the first sighting I've ever seen.  I would not dismiss the Idea that it was a weather balloon ascending out of sight.  My education is BSBA, MBA, I am a financial analyst for a national law firm, my father is a retired M.D. and my mother is a homemaker. ((NUFORC:  Venus may be visible in the western sky at this hour, but we do not have any explanation for why it would have suddenly disappeared from sight.));41.1337037037037;-95.9312777777778
