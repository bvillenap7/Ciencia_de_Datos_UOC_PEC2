It looked like about ten rockets screaming accross the sky. Looking directly south it was about 35 degrees high in the sky moving to the east - northeast. They all had a yellowy bright glow leaving sparks in the wake. Burning up quickly as the minute passed and more fading out than going out of sight. They were about three or four times as bright as the brightest star. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness is describing the re-entry event that occurred at approximately 2120 hrs.
