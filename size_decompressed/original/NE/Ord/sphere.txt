The red spheres dimmed and dissappeared only to be followed by more red lights appearing and staying staying stationary in the sky but in a different formation roughly in the same spot of the Eastern sky.  This went on and on until we had enough fishing and UFO watching and we were tired and hungry from being out all afternoon.  As we drove off home towards Ord from the sandpits we were at west of town we saw one last glimpse of the strange lights and then the trees were blocking our sight of the sky from then on.;41.5989;-98.9458
