It looked as if it were heading from the SSE moving NNW towards Omaha.  It appeared for only about 3 seconds and also appeared to have possibly disintegrated into the air before it reached the tree tops. I think it was probably space junk. The appearance of it seemed to be metallic because I briefly saw a bright glare from it as if the sun behind me were reflecting off of it. The size of it was big at first and then seemed to shrink in size before disintegrating. It didn’t leave any smoke trail after it disappeared. The largest size of it was about the same as if you were to look at a golf ball from 10 feet across the room. I’m a 34 year old male, former AF meteorologist and was alone in my car.
