Pod or cigar shaped craft over plattsmouth;2009-09-20 15:14:00;2 mins;Pod or cigar shaped craft over plattsmouth A silverish white pod like craft over plattsmouth,NE  It was september,20 at approximately 3:14 pm the sky was clear very few clouds. I came out on my porch to observed what i thought was a plane,but as i looked closer i observed that it was indeed something remarkable.It was what i have seen before in this town on many occasions and this time was no different.it was a cigar or pod like craft with no wings and no noise i have read reports of this same craft being seen around this area so i know it is not just me seen what my mind wants me to see. This craft looks like a commercial plane at a distance,but i have seen this craft up close before and it is weird, very different from most UFO's.I keeping having repeated sightings, it's up to six of this same UFO now and i will continue to make reports as i see them. I urge anyone that spots this same UFO to make a report so that we may get to the bottom of what i am dubbing now as the tri-county area UFO.;41.0052;-95.8978
