Coming along side of hwy 20 between Carroll  Nebraska and Osmond ne, about 1:30am, there were 2 of us in our pickup driving west towards Osmand when we noticed a blue light (not thinking anything of it,)when within seconds it was next to us hovering above the tops of the corn. It,the craft, stayed with us observing us as we observed it for about 3 minutes then it scared a deer from the corn rows before going on behind us once again as a small blue light. We were going 60-65mph at the time and it stayed with us. The craft made no noise, was oval in shape, what i call bright pepsi can blue in color and had a white flashing light on one end. I was continually able to watch it and was not afraid of it at all! In fact I was facinated with it!;42.3511;-97.592
