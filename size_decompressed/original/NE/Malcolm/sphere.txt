Daytime sighting of large, unmoving, silent sphere that blended with sky & clouds near Lincoln Nebraska in August, 2006;2006-08-15 16:00:00;15 minutes;Daytime sighting of large, unmoving, silent sphere that blended with sky & clouds near Lincoln Nebraska in August, 2006 I was driving east on the 2 mile road linking Malcolm to Highway 34 (heading toward Lincoln) at about 4 pm.  I looked up and saw a HUGE sphere in the sky.  It was perfectly still, and made no sound.  I only looked up because of some birds--I wouldn't have noticed it otherwise--it blended almost completely in with the surrounding sky and clouds, but you could see the edges of it fairly clearly when you were looking straight at it.  It wasn't reflective at all, and I didn't see lights.  It was weird--I remember thinking it was almost like there was some kind of computer generated surface on the object that matched it exactly to the color of the sky and cloud cover, but you could see that the clouds didn't match up on the edges with the sky, and that they were moving a little differently than the real clouds.  I pulled my car over and got out to watch it for at least 15 minutes.  It didn't move.  I had my young children in the car with me--they had an after sch! ool appointment, so I had to continue on into Lincoln.  For the record, I know what a weather balloon looks like, and this was way too big and the wrong color to be a weather balloon.  I have no idea what it was, or how much longer it was there.  I should add that this was within 5 miles of the Nebraska Air National Guard base, within 45 miles of Offutt Airforce base in Omaha.  What did I see? ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.
