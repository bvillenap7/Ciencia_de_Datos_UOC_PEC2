North to south. I was looking at the night sky when I observed a roughly triangular shaped object whose margins were unspecific. The object was transparent in the fact that I could see the bright stars of the Milky Way behind it. The night was quite clear and the star feild exceptionally sharp. As the object passed across my feild of vision the stars behind it tended to blur somewhat in comparison to the stars outside the margins of the object. There were no other visible lights except for the stars. The trajectory was from north to south. I am a Licensed Practical Nurse. I am a trained observer by profession.;40.8663;-99.9919
