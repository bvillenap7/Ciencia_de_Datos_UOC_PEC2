I'm in the town of Cozad.  Object appeared to be within 10-15 miles.  Hard to tell. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) I had one misspelled word (fround, meant ground)  Was nervous forgot to mention speed was beyond anything like a known aircraft  Was 1000 mph or more imo.  Traveled almost like a smooth or fluid type slight wobble.  Hard to put in words. ((END ADDENDUM));40.8663;-99.9919
