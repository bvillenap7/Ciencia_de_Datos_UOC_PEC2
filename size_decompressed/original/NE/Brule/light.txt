It was moving slow, and then would speed up as if moving through some sort of resistance, such as wind. It almost seemed to be building energy and propelling itself faster, then slow down, build up and move faster again. It traversed steadily between the two speeds, never stopping. I watched the object for approximately three minutes while talking on the phone to my Dad in CA describing what I was seeing the whole time and do not believe it was a satellite, because prior to the sighting, I watched a satellite move from the south to the north, so I could compare the two objects.;41.1002;-101.9099
