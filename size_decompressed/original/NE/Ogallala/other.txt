To Fast to Be a Satellite. No Sound At All! My friends and I saw a craft in the air. We thought it may have been a satellite or a space station and could have been. It was enormous in size and was below the stars. It had multi-illumanated panels. The panels were giving off shapes and colors unlike anything I have ever scene. We believe it was a satellite though when researching it we turned up nothing. The craft made rotations around the globe. Every 11 1/2 minutes approximatley. I thought it must be some sort of satellite. No way! It was either a dozen satellites or something moving faster around the globe than anything ever recorded. It kept the same path, rising on the west and going down on the east. What was it?;41.1236;-101.7083
