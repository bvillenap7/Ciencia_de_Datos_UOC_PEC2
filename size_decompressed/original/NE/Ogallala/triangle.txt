Spotted Triangle of lights above No Name Bay at Lake McConaughey in Ogallala NE;2016-08-14 21:30:00;>15 minutes;Spotted Triangle of lights above No Name Bay at Lake McConaughey in Ogallala NE Spotted above No Name Bay at Lake McConaughey in Ogallala, NE.  The top light didn’t move or flash.  The bottom left light flashed green, yellow and red in what appeared to be an orb or circular pattern.  I couldn’t be certain but it looked like lights were going around a dark sphere.  The bottom right light was bright orange/yellow.   It darted up, down, right and left in no particular pattern but in short quick motions.  A blue, dim, small light appeared to the right of the bright orange yellow light.  They seemed to dance together, like the bottom right light was chasing the blue one.  A bright light quickly dropped between the two at one point.   We watched for 15 minutes and got spooked.;41.1236;-101.7083
Three, bright green triangles in night sky over Nebraska. Abduction of my friend Mary Joe.;2021-03-05 22:00:00;15 minutes;Three, bright green triangles in night sky over Nebraska. Abduction of my friend Mary Joe. Around 22:00, during a group campfire, 3 members of the party (including myself) were separated from the group. We witnessed in the eastern area of the sky three stunningly bright green triangles. They were each equilateral and in a triangle formation themselves. Both other witnesses can confirm they appeared suddenly, grew larger as if they were approaching the earth, and then very rapidly shot back away into the sky. This entire process took about 15 minutes, as most of this time consisted of them hovering motionless in the sky. Then after this happened, a close encounter occurred, where a man of short stature, grabbed my friend's hand and abducted him back to the ship. He is still missing to this day and a police investigation has been launched. We are very worried for his well being, so we need a rapid response from a professional.;41.1236;-101.7083
