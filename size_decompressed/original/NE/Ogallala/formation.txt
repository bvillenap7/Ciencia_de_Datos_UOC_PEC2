Three objects traveling in formation at approx.3:30am;2003-06-09 03:00:00;10min;Three objects traveling in formation at approx.3:30am The objects were travelling towards the north/northeast in a formation of 3 with 2 side by side at the front and the third trailing behind the others,yet all moving at the same speed. We,too,thought that they were stars at first,but after we watched them, we realized that they were moving across the sky (the stars around them were not moving).  This earlier posting is the same description of what we saw:  they were extremely high,maybe,even outside of earths atmosphere and they were flying in perfect sync...with each other...(keeping perfect formation) and then disappeared out of sight.all was quiet at that time of the morning and we heard no sounds from the objects. ((NUFORC Note:  The objects may have been the three apparently satellites, which are frequently reported to NUFORC, and which we believe are three satellites launched periodically by the U. S. Navy.  Just a guess.  PD));41.1236;-101.7083
