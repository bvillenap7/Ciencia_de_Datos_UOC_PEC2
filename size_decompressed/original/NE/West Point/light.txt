strange orange lights in the night sky;2003-09-19 20:00:00;15 to 20 min;strange orange lights in the night sky I am a police officer in west point nebraska so my annonimity is essential.  I and another officer were doing security for a high school football game, when off to the east we noticed what appeared to be a orangish light that seperated in to 4 seperate lights.  The light were in a diagnal straight line.  when the light on the right side would go out another would appear on the left, giving the appearance that the lights where traveling accross the sky.  I observed another light appear to the lower left of the set of 4. The lights were visible for about 5 to 10 min and then went out.  We observed them re appear again about 5 min later.   When the lights re appeared I was looking at them through my binoculars.  They were smaller white lights in the area that i could see, but did not appear to be aircraft lights. I am not sure what they were. I at first thought maybe they were flares from military type aircraft.  I talked with some ex milatry people about what military flares look like.  I have been told that they burn out fairly quickly, where these lights seem to stay visible for quite some time.;41.8485;-96.734
