At about 1:34 a.m., we went outside to smoke a cigarette and looked up at the clear night sky and noticed a /\ shaped unknown flying object (UFO) in the sky to the west.  The UFO was flying from the Northwest to the Southeast.  There were seven round shaped lights that were very faint luminescence and barely noticable.  The UFO was moving slowly and was silent and made strange and smooth movements unlike anything we have ever seen before.   After about 30 seconds, the object disappeared from our field of vision.;41.8485;-96.734
