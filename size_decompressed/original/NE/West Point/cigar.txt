Cigar Shaped UFO Flying Into a Storm Cloud;2007-09-30 17:30:00;1 Second;Cigar Shaped UFO Flying Into a Storm Cloud It was 5:27 in the evening. I was waiting for my brother in his car outside his house, when I looked up to the east and saw a Cigar Shaped, Silver object fly into the leading edge of a storm cloud. There may have been more already in the cloud but I didn't see them. It was close enough that if it were an Airplane I would have heard it and there was no contrail. I don’t drink and I don’t do drugs and I wasn’t tired.;41.8485;-96.734
