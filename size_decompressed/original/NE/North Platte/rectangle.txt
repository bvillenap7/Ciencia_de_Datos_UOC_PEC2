Massive UFO at Union Pacific Bailey Yard.;1985-08-16 18:00:00;35-40 minutes;Massive  UFO  at  Union Pacific Bailey Yard UFO Incident at   Union Pacific Bailey Yard I was working The East Hump helper  (switchman) on August 16, 1985. My job was to line the Hump Engine thru a clear track ..then get around train at west end. .then line switch  to proceed to the hill.  If Yardmaster said go 8-4.  You would send engine west thru 8, and then line 4 to the hill.   At around 6:00 PM ..I was waiting  in Pinner’s Shack (located between Tracks 4 & 5) at East End to Climb on Train being Shoved at 5 mph by hump engine.  Suddenly the Speaker went off and front chair yardmaster was yelling  Do you see that?  Do you see that?  The ground was shaking and I came out of the Shack and to my Astonishment, when I looked Up   a   saw   a   huge Rectangular   Craft.  It was Massive!  It was 400 yards wide by   800 yards long in fact it almost covered   the whole East Receiving Yard which is about a mile and a quarter in length.  It was Black and light Silver in color and about every 50 ‘ or so there  were round  turrets on it.  I believe this UFO was interested in the Train Movements because Union Pacific Bailey Yard located in North Platte, Nebraska is The World’s Largest Rail Classification Yard. It hovered above me for a good 35-40 mins   and made a   whirring noise. .not really loud  but noticeable.  The Engineer and other helper on the Hump Engine   .saw it to  and  The Switch Foreman in Hump Tower and both Yardmasters also .  One Thing I will say I have never in my life seen anything leave so fast, this craft went from a standstill to being gone in about a second!  To my knowledge this has never been reported by anyone   and most like forgotten about.  But not for me..this haunts me like a  bad dream…I remember this like it happened yesterday.  I can submit a sketch/drawing of it..however I will probably have to mail it  to you.(as I do not have any computer program that does that unfortunately).  When the Train finally came to the Hill..the Yardmaster stopped it.  I was told to come inside, In all my years in the Yard  this has only happened twice…once in a Tornado Watch and this.  We discussed  what we all saw upstairs in the Yardmaster s area of the Tower.   We all decided not to say anything to avoid  being called kooks  or crazy.  I will verify that this incident did really happen and I have decided after all these years it needs reported.;41.1314000000002;-100.7751
