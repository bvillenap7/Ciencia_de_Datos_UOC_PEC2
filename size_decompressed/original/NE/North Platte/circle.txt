Object over North Platte Nebraska;2011-10-10 21:55:00;3 seconds;Object over North Platte Nebraska At approximately 21:55 on 10-10-2011 I was about 2 miles south of North Platte on hwy 83 headed north. I was on a section of the hwy that had a view of direct north with no obstructions. As I approached the highest elevation of that section of the highway I saw a bright light that lasted for about 3 to 4 seconds.  I was on a direct north route and the object I saw was in the upper right corner of the windshield.  I was unaware if the object was there for some time,I believe I saw it only as it came into view of my windshield.  I would say it was about 20 degrees to my right traveling a direct south to north route. The object had no tail so I believe it was not a comet that entered the atmosphere. The best way I can describe it in size and shape would be the same as the planet Jupiter.  I am very familiar with that planet as I see it the morning from my back porch (I use Google Sky Map on my phone) It was round and it moved very quickly.  It was very bright and it was a white light with no color at all.  I see planes and helicopter in this area all the time and it was defiantly neither. The altitude I cannot determine as there were no other objects to reference in the night sky. It seemed to be going due north but not descending.  At one point it was gone I am not sure where it went as I had to get my eyes back on the road.  As I looked again it was gone.  The weather conditions were clear and cloudless. I am not claiming to have seen a UFO or spaceship what I saw was a large round bright object in the sky moving at a very high rate of speed.;41.1314000000002;-100.7751
A large bright orange glowing ball floating silently above the trees.;2013-07-03 22:15:00;5 minutes;A large bright orange glowing ball floating silently above the trees. Our First Sighting:  A Large Bright Orange Glowing Ball Floating Silently Above the Trees, It Was Headed South, Then West A Ways,  Then Headed Directly North On 07/03/2013   North Platte, Nebraska  I was sitting out back on our deck behind our house, on the south side of our house.  It was about 10:15 pm when I noticed a large bright orange glowing ball.  At first it was moving from east to west above the tree line beside our house, headed south then it went a west a ways, then it headed directly north.  It was about the size of a small airplane, but it was round, it continued above the tree line heading west. I ran to the back door & called to my husband to come quick & hurry, come here fast!! He did, I pointed to the object & he looked & saw it too.  He said: I see it!  There was no sound coming from it.  As we watched, it then went off toward the south, my husband had to leave, so I watched it as it then turned & went west a ways before heading off north until it was out of my site.;41.1314000000002;-100.7751

Our Second Sighting:  Large Bright Orange Glowing Balls Traveling In Twos On 07/04/2013   North Platte, Nebraska  Our second sighting: Again out of North Platte Nebraska, on July 4, 2013 around 9:20 pm I was out back on the deck behind our house in our yard watching fire works when I observed two large round bright orange glowing objects coming from the west & two from the south at the same time. The ones coming from the west turned north as they reached the edge of North Platte & the ones coming from the south were going north & they all continued north until they were no longer visible. This continued for about 2 hours. I watched a minimum of 25 to 30 of them within that time period. After 11 pm they stopped coming. My husband witnessed two of them going from the south to the north as he was leaving for work around 10:30 pm & again there was no sound coming from them.;41.1314000000002;-100.7751
20+ reddish gold orbs floating from the south of community to the north.;2013-07-04 22:00:00;>1 hour;20+ reddish gold orbs floating from the south of community to the north. Was out in backyard with husband,  watching fireworks when we witnessed a small reddish-gold orb crossing from the south to the north.  At first, we thought it was a firework but as the fireworks went out, this orb kept moving and the light did not go out.  These orbs appeared to be round, floating, no sound, then as we kept watching, we seen more, on average, 3-5, they were heading from the south to the north of our community, they appear to float.  At one time, we witnessed 7 orbs to the north of the community and stayed approx 20 minutes.  Then they just disappeared, then we would see one or two more showing up and heading to the north and to the west of the community. I have no digital camera to take photos.;41.1314000000002;-100.7751
