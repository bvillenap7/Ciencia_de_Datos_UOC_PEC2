Large saucer objects relative to the size of the moon, moving slowly and disappearing.;2011-03-11 21:26:00;20-25 seconds;Large saucer objects relative to the size of the moon, moving slowly and disappearing. I was outside smoking with my brother when I looked up at the sky in the west.  I seen two large objects with a size that was relative to the moon.  They were so large that I first thought it was a blimp of some sort.  I continued watching and they moved relatively slow going from left to right.  Left to right in my case would be that they were moving north.  The objects were at about a thirty to forty degree angle.  As the two large objects headed north, they came together side-to-side and became stationary.  I knew the objects were saucer shaped because there was many red lights that made it known, they were this shape.  Once stationary, the objects were seen for about five more seconds when they slowly disappeared.;41.1314000000002;-100.7751
