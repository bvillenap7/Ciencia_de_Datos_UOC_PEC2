It was being followed by what Appeared to be a Unmanned drone..It was moving slow from North east to Southwest.  This thing didn't seem to make any noise at all....  My son went on youtube right away and was looking up sightings,  and found the exact same UFO was being chased by F-16s over Belgium 12 years ago....  WOW we are excited..I have Lived here for 50 years and have seen 7 Ufos around here in the last 6 years.  I come from a Family of Pilots, Private and Military so I would like to think I know the difference;41.1314000000002;-100.7751
