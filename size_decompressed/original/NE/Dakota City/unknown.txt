I am now home for the summer and when I got home from work one night I saw three objects in the sky. They had kind of a red glow and they seemed to be moving in a coordinated pattern, kind of like they were looking for something. They made no noise that i could hear and were flying pretty low to the ground. They were too far away to discern what the shape of the objects were.
