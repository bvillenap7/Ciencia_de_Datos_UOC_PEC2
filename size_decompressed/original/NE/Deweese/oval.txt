Five crafts fought in a arial battal.;2004-05-11 02:00:00;1.5 hours;Five crafts fought in a arial battal. Well I woke up to the sound of thunder one early morning. I looked outside and the ski was clear as day. All of a sudden there was a flash to the north. Two very fast moving objects were headed in my direction followed by another flash and two other objects of the same shape. Minutes later a diamond shaped craft much larger the others attacked the oval crafts. The smaller crafts flew around the diamond craft and began firing shocks of energy at the diamond shaped craft. A big explosion shook my grain bin and it fell apart. My wife and four kids woke up screaming and crying. In another flash the ufos were gone.;40.3584;-98.1386
