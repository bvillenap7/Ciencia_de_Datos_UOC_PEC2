SHINY WHITE OBJECT IN THE SKY, VERY VISIBLE TO NAKED EYE.;2017-09-08 10:00:00;4.5 hours;SHINY WHITE OBJECT IN THE SKY, VERY VISIBLE TO NAKED EYE. APPROXIMATELY 10A.M., WHILE WORKING, NOTICED A WHITE ROUND FIGURE IN THE SKY.  CO-WORKERS WITNESSED THIS AS WELL.  SHAPE DID NOT MOVE FOR SEVERAL HOURS.   AT ONE POINT, WHILE LOOKING AT THE SHAPE, IT DISAPPEARED.  THE OBJECT WAS GONE FOR A TIME LONG ENOUGH TO CALL THE REPORTING CENTER.  WHILE ON THE PHONE, THE OBJECT RE-APPEARED.  NOT SURE IF IT WAS THE ANGLE THE SUN WAS HITTING THE OBJECT OR IF IT MOVED MOMENTARILY.   CALLED FRIENDS AND COWORKERS AT DIFFERENT LOCATIONS TO CONFIRM WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE ABLE TO SEE IT.  THEY COULD SEE AND DESCRIBE THE OBJECT AS I SAW IT.   BY APPROXIMATELY 3:30, THE OBJECT WAS GONE.
