Bright orange lit saucer going over Lexington, NE, north to south.;2015-06-27 20:17:00;5-10 minutes;Bright orange lit saucer going over Lexington, NE, north to south. We were just sitting out on the porch smoking a cigarette when i looked up and saw this huge orange light in the sky..  i immediately ran in the house and got everyone outside to look..  it approached from the north headed south and continued south till it disapeared..   at the point that it was just over us we could see that it was pretty large, saucer shaped... only one single light...  Orange... glowing for the top of the vessel. I DO have a video of the object but it is as it was further away and leaving the area, however my camera is very high quality...  if i am contacted further by an investigator I will share the video.;40.785;-99.7515
