My father and I couldn’t identify the object, initially assuming it was a blimp, but it was far too high.  It remained stationary for the ten minutes we observed it.  My mother and neighbor also witnessed the object, but they weren’t as intrigued.  I had to get my kids home to Kearney before their bedtime, so I drove away. Location: Lexington, NE Dawson County Call received in: Kearney, NE Buffalo County Date: 6/21/19 Time: ~21:12  I received a call from my father around 21:00 where he told me that the object was still hanging in the same location.  We spoke for about 10 minutes before he excitedly mentioned an object with a flaming tail moving toward the initial UFO.  He didn’t mention any sort of strike, but the second “flame-tail” object continued moving east.   Within a minute, I could see this second object above Kearney, flying surprisingly low.  It was streaking a pair of vapor trails as it flew east.  It was flying low enough that my phone could flicked in and out of focus on it as I trying taking snapshots.  What my dad assumed was a flaming tail, I figured was the reflection of the sunset on the lower-rear hull, as the sun was setting.  As low as the plane was, the wingspan seemed too narrow to be a commercial airliner.  It was also flying far faster than I recall my flight from Denver to Omaha ever going, as it flew into Kearney airspace and left it in what felt like less than a minute. As a strange coincidence, several sirens started going off near my house at the same time.  I couldn’t tell if they were police or ambulance sirens, but they faded before long.;40.785;-99.7515
