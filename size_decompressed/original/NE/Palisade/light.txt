Odd point of light seen in clouded sky;2010-08-04 01:00:00;unknown;Odd point of light seen in clouded sky I was looking out my back door as I let my dog back in, and I saw an odd point of light off in the distance (30-45 degrees above horizontal). I didnt think much of it at first really, perhaps a reflection onto the glass of the door.  So I opened the door up and looked beyond the glass and I could still see it. Again, it was just a point of light, something akin to a star.  But a storm had just been through, and there was solid cloudcover overhead, lightening still flashing about.  As I watched the light, it seemed to shift from side to side very slightly every 30 seconds or so. In addition to its movements, there was a 'pulse' of light around it.   Thats the best I can word what happened.  There was the central point of white light, and in a very minute 'aura' like section around it, there was a pulsing light ring that shifted from red, to blue, to white, and through that cycle fairly quickly.
