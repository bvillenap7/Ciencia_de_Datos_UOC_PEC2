We were at Fourth of July event when these objects started flying from our South sky and headed North West.  They kept coming one after another up to about seven of them. Then a few minutes later, one came across the sky from East to West.  They were a solid white or yellowish light all the way past us.  Seemed odd for that many planes in a row to be passing over at night?  No sound at all.;40.3795;-95.8612999999999
