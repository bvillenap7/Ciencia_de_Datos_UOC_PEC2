While on Patrol in the Sutherland area I noticed some refection North of Town near the City's Water tank.  Went to that location to see what was going on and found some kids drinking beer.  While having them dump out 10 bottle of a 12 pack one of then said hey what is that.  I was facing to the west and look towards the North-West and observed a Craft floating above the ground.  I would estimate this dark Meltalic Craft was about 2000 feet above the ground and about 1000 to 1500 feet away from my location.  The craft was transiting to the south, but at a very slow pace.  When it was in a South-Westerly position the mostly full moon reflected or lit up the craft.  I noticed it had rows of square objects on the side like windows which were all darker than the body of the craft which was a dark gray-black.  The craft had an odd shape too.  If you can imagine the top half shape of a stop sign with a cylinder attached to the longer edge of the upper stop sign centered evolving into a triangular oval tail section which was flat at the back end.  This oval-triangular rear end had three circles, with one large one in the center and two smaller ones on either side of the larger. The side were at an odd angles and it appeared the upper portion of the craft was wider than the lower half.  Front _____ /     \ /       \ /_________\ | | | | /   \ /     \ /_______\  Rough Example.

We watched it move to the south and about the time it was over the town of Sutherland, I called on the radio to another Officer who was in the Wallace area (22 Miles to the south on highway 25.  I advised him about what I was looking at and he said he would start heading North and see if he could catch it.  Just as I had mentioned the Craft we all noticed the three circles flash bright white ( about the same shade of white as a monitor displays when you have a bland white page on the screen.) a couple of times.  The Craft started moving faster and closed the distance between Sutherland and a position just south and west of the Gerald Gentelman Power Plant about where the correction line is in the highway.  (About 8 miles) in about 40 seconds.  The craft then veered to the south east and headed on a line of travel that would have taken it close to Dickens. seven (7) miles to the east of Wallace on Highway 23.  The officer to the south called me back a few minutes after I had talked to him and stated he could see the craft and estimated it was moving about 400 miles per hour heading off the the south east towards Dickens.  He also stated it was Eluminated be the lights from the power plant whne he spotted it and disappered into the darkness.  I have no Idea if this was an Experimental Aircraft but I would have to say it was twice as long as an Airforce C5 Galaxy and 1 and a half times as wide.  Who knows it could have been something from Area 51 that the Government was playing with or a UFO!  The Teens and myself all experenced the air around us to seem to be electrostaticly charged, because not only myself, but the others experenced the hair on our arms and head to stand up. (kind of like when you rub a baloon against your hair.) ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  The orientation of the craft did not survive the transfer from the e-mail program to the database.
