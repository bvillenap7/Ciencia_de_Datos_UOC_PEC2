No lights. Illuninated by city glare. Alt. unknown. Straight overhead.  Width, 2.5 fingers at arms length. (Thickness of fingers). 9:46 pm, Mar 20, 1998. I went out side to get something out of my truck and heard Geese flying over.  I was looking up, blocking the house lights so I could see better. Some times when geese fly over at nite in the dark you can spot them in the city lights glare. As I looked somewhat to the west I thought I saw some comming over me going east. But as the lights from town hit IT,  I could make out a perfect triangle. For a few seconds I thought my eyes were playing a trick on me and it was really a flock of geese flying back to roost for the nite. But the harder I Iooked, the more I realized it was a solid shape,  not a V.  It looked dark gray or black with only reflected light illuminating it. It continued east untill it was out of the glare of the city.  I continued to watch that direction to see if it blocked out any stars momentairly,  but it didn't, (that I could tell).  When it was directly overhead, it didn't pass over any brite stars, to block them out.  I couldn't tell how high it was but it was 2  1/2 fingers long.  That is, the thickness of my fingers at arms length. There were comercial jets in the area at their crusing alt. but I suspect this UFO was way lower then them because one finger could easily block them out.   Not 2 to 3 like the UFO. This is about all I saw.  Just here a few second...then gone.;40.717607846154;-99.0847358461545
Triangle Crafts over Kearney, Nebraska;2003-02-19 19:00:00;30-40 sec.;Triangle Crafts over Kearney, Nebraska I was sitting on the deck of our house in Kearney Nebraska and my husband was walking towards me from the garage to the south west of the deck when I noticed 3 black triangle shaped crafts flying towards the house. I screamed for my husband to look, and pointed at the sky. We watched these three crafts, silently fly from south to north over our house and then head east. They were very low I could see them against the orange glow from the city lights. There were no lights of any kind on the crafts.;40.717607846154;-99.0847358461545
