Large, round, red light sighted in Kearney, Nebraska silently flying very low and slow to the ground.;2009-02-05 01:00:00;10 minutes;Large, round, red light sighted in Kearney, Nebraska, silently flying very low and slow to the ground. I wanted to share with you a sighting I had about 2-3 weeks ago in my home town outside my apartment.  I am not saying it was a UFO or anything, but I have never seen something like it and was wondering if you have heard about anything similar to it. To start out, I live in a small town(about 25 thousand people) in central Nebraska no where near any large busy airports and airplanes are not a normality to see.  During the day, the only planes we see around here are small privately owned planes or crop dusters.  Within my town, there is also a large hospital with medical helicopters that often fly through the sky, what I initially thought it to be.  However, they have a distinct chopper sound and can be easily heard. I was leaving my apartment walking out to my car.  When I got in and started it up, I noticed a strange large round light in the sky.  What confused me was the fact that it was sort of a reddish amber color in the sky AND it was flying very low and very slow.  I stopped and just stared at it.  It took forever for it to traverse the sky.  I got out of my car to get a clearer look of it, and also noticed that there was no sound.  Seeing this light completely perplexed me because it couldn't have been any aircraft normally seen around my town especially at that time.  I don't know of any aircraft that ONLY has a red light either.  Furthermore, I have never seen anything fly so slow or low to the ground.  The fact that the light was so large (I would estimate it to be 60-75 feet in diameter) was even more strange because it didn't match any aircraft known to me.  I stared at it for a good 5-10 minutes because I didn't want to miss anything else if it were to happen.  It finally got too far away for me to see.  As stated earlier, I am not saying that it is a UFO, but to me, I can not personally explain it. I am not sure what I saw that night and have never seen anything like it.  I would just like to know if this description matches any known aircraft or if what I saw truly was a UFO. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.
