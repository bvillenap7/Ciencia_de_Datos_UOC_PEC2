Strange light in Kearney, Nebraska;2010-07-07 23:15:00;3 minutes;Strange light in Kearney, Nebraska After July 4th 2010 I have found myself watching the sky a lot more than usual.  And on July 6th at 11:13 Pm My Husband and I noticed a very strange light in the sky moving to the southeast.  It passed underneath an airplane as it was moving.  We noticed it was no further than a half mile in the air and about 5 miles to the north west of us.  It moved very fast and came right over the top of my house. To start off it was a very bright white light.  But the closer it got it seemed to change from white to orange. As it got over my house my husband and I looked up and the light was so bright we could not see past the light to see what it was.  It made no noise at all, which I thought was very strange due to how close it was.  But then the light seemed to fade and what ever it was just disappeared. It was gone by 11:16 pm.  Only lasted 3 minutes but it has really intrigued me. I am going to go by a video camera because it seems as if these sightings are happening more o! ften in this area.  I will be ready if I ever see another one so I can catch it and prove to everyone I am really not losing my mind.;40.717607846154;-99.0847358461545

It faded in and then out, like it was catching the reflection of the 3/4 moon. Skies were clear, I would estimate it was 20,000 to 30,000 ft AGL, no navigation lights.;40.717607846154;-99.0847358461545
