Multiple UFO sightings in Kearney Nebraska;2010-07-04 22:30:00;35 min;Multiple UFO sightings in Kearney Nebraska On July 4th, 2010, at 10:30 Pm me and my husband were outside watching fireworks when I noticed  12 Red orbs to the north of our house.  We watched as the orbs seem to be moving to the North, Northwest very slowly.  This was a different direction then the embers from the fireworks were going.  They were about a half a mile in the air and made no sound at all.  The UFOâ€™s stayed the same distance apart, and really had no formation that I could recognize. This cluster of Red orbs moved out of sight in 5 to 6 minutes.  Then as I watched the sky I saw one single red orb come from the east, moving to the west the same path as the cluster moved. It seemed to move at the same speed and the same height as the others had.  The light faded and just disappeared within five minutes.  In the next 15 minutes we had seen two more orbs do the same thing as the previous ones. I really have no idea what these UFOs were but I am glad to see others had seen the same thing.   It makes me feel like I am not losing it.;40.717607846154;-99.0847358461545
