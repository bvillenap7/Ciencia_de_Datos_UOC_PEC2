Flaming tear-shaped object flying over southwest Lincoln, Nebraska on July 4th.;2008-07-04 22:30:00;1 minute appx;Flaming tear-shaped object flying over southwest Lincoln, Nebraska on July 4th. While watching the fireworks show over Lincoln, Nebraska from our balcony on the third floor, we noticed a large tear shaped object flying across the sky from south southwest to north northeast. The object was moving rapidly and at approximately 10,000 to 15,000 feet altitude.  The object appeared either to be on fire or have orange glow emanating from rear.  At first, we thought it may have been part of the fireworks display, but the object was much too high and moving purposefully, with clear direction and even speed. There were no erratic movements, simply a straight line in the direction indicated previously. One of the witnesses is an avionics technician, and was completely certain that the object could not have been an airplane.;40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121
