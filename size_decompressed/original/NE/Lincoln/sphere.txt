Large Object hovering at low altitude in sky in Lincoln Nebraska;1981-11-01 22:00:00;3-5 minutes;Large Object hovering at low altitude in sky in Lincoln Nebraska This episode has bothered me for years.  I just found this site and decided to relay information on what I saw this evening.   Over the years, I have forgotten the exact date, but it's as close as I remember it.   My dad was diagnosed with cancer just a couple of days before this and was a patient at what was then St. Elizabeth's Hospital (I believe on South 70th St.).   My husband and I lived in South Lincoln South of Old Cheney Road between 27th & 40th St.  As we were driving home from the hospital we saw what looked like a monstrous round spaceship.  I actually feel silly putting this into writing, as most everyone I know would write me off a kook.   We spotted it about 5,000 - 8,000 feet up in the air over South Lincoln near 48th St.  It was in the air long enough for us to come home and watch it literally hover in the air without a single sound (other than a dull hum) from the time we spotted it at approx 48th & O St. to our home.   My husband and I were literally frozen.  We don't remember hearing each other talk, although I know I was speaking.   The next day we asked people at work and found just one person who witnessed the same object hovering in the air that night before.  The best way to describe this object was that it was very similar in size & shape as the Mother Ship in Close Encounters.   I would swear under oath about this experience.;40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121

I would periodically look out my window for no reason in particular.  At one point looking out the window I saw a bright white sphere definately in our atmosphere.  This white sphere was motionless and far larger than any star.  Not shocked at this point I told my friend to take a look. He acknowledged it.  A moment later the object began to move slowly for ten seconds then rapidly southwest-soon out of sight.  We kept looking in the sky after that and a few moments later it all happend again.  Seemingly the same craft. And upon recognizing it, it did exactly what I previously described.  But this time, possible coincidence, a jet flew toward the S.W. as did the UFO.  We talked to each other for a moment and looked back at the sky.  We saw what I would decribe as a simon says game in the sky(blue yellow red green lights) This was certainly a craft and much larger than the spheres.  I started opening my door for a good look, as I did my friend screamed Oh my god!and pointed at door.  My door slammed shut on me and there were two Schnauzers(dogs) growling scratching on the door.as if preventing me to leave(it worked!)  I noticed three more of the SAME dogs over to the left.  Two sitting still, one running back and forth histarically in front of the sitters. the sitting dogs were looking at our car! There were NO owners around we did not see the dogs before the crafts, and I've never seen so many dogs of same breed together unattended in my life! I believe I have had a screen memory as described in Whitley Striebers book Communion. Needless to say we started the car and got out of that park right away. The park was next to a highway and residentials, so it would be unbelievable if I had no second witness, but I did. I swear I saw all that I have written here.  All of this experience I will never forget, espescially the dogs The first two objects, possibly the same craft were bright white spheres.  The third was circular with four lights.  each light took approx. a quarter of the bottom of craft.  the lights were 1 red, 1green, 1blue, 1yellow.  I also saw five dogs that looked exatly the same. The first two spheres were motionless, then after being witnessed for a moment they took off until out of sight.  The simon says game did the same.  Two dogs pounded on my car door, two sat quietly in the distance, one ran back and forth like doing windsprints for football warmups. Three crafts observed, one jet observed, five dogs observed Two object bright white, one red,yellow,blue,green- jet color unknown-dogs grey and white my backround is a 19 year old male raised since three years old in Lincoln NE. I was in high school and since graduated.  With interests in poetry, philosophy, art, music and politcal actions.  the other witness was a 18yr old now 20 male from Lincoln NE.;40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121
Two glowing orange balls of light traveling in a southern direction dropping flares and continuing south.;2008-10-07 21:45:00;2 Minutes;Two glowing orange balls of light traveling in a southern direction dropping flares and continuing south. North of our Apartment in the sky about 1500 feet in the air 2 orange glowing balls of light were traveling towards us.  They both seemed to flicker orange and brighter on the outside and darker on the inside.  As they came directly over the top of our Apt. they made no noise so my girlfriend and I knew it wasn't a plane or helicopter.  The 2nd orange ball seemed to actually speed up a little to catch the ball in front of it just for a moment.  Then it appeared that both of them started shooting flares several at a time out of the orange balls.  The lead ball started with maybe 2-3 balls and then the 2nd ball did the same.  It seemed as the flares were falling from the orange balls that the orange glow became dimmer and also it appeared that they were brighter from the front of the ball then the back side.  As they continued in the sky towards the south they seemed to keep the same altitude but eventually left our field of vision. The sky was clear with no clouds on a brisk cool night.  Between 50-60 degrees out.  We both stood there in disbelief as to what we actually just witnessed.;40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121
