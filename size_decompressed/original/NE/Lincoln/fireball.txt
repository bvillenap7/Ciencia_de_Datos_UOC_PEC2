Massive fireball over Lincoln, Nebraska.;2004-12-01 23:00:00;2-3 seconds;Massive fireball over Lincoln, Nebraska. A friend and I were sitting in a car listening to the radio, and we saw reddish-maroonish fireball approx. over I-180 going southbound.   I'm surprised nobody else reported the fireball.   We were near superior looking west.   The fireball illuminated the sky, lit up everything, casted shadows, left slight trail that disappeared as fast as fireball, and even made me squint my eyes.  After seeing this, the both of us just looked at each other and said, What the (you know.)  We hysterical for a minute then tried to figure out what it was.  A meteor?  This object was huge.  Bigger than memorial stadium.  Why no impact?  Very weird.  Oh yeah, it's now feb 2005, date and time appox.  but my estimate is damn near close. Somebody enlighten me.
