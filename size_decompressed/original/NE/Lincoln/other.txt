I got my tape recorder out and recorded 2 sounds out of a total of 4.  It sounds like some type of code in musical form.  I heard it 4 times and got it twice on tape.    I played the recording for several people, and they have never heard anything like it before either.  I called a local computer store, played it for them, they said the same thing.  I am wondering if I could get you to listen to it as well?  It is rather a strange sound.  I cannot get my sound recorder to work, or I would have recorded it on there.  I recorded it on my portable tape recorder, by placing the recorder by the speakers.  I would really like to know what this sound was and where it came from. ((NUFORC Note:  We have listened to the sound, and it may be a garbled voice, transmitting on single side band.  That is just a guess.  PD));40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121
4th observation of a light above my skies in pattern;2004-07-22 22:29:00;3 minutes;4th observation of a light above my skies in pattern While standing on my 3rd floor balcony facing S-SE, I observed a single object approx. 3-5 miles away, at 22:29 hrs.  The object at its distance would be as bright as a garage flood light about 50 ft away. It seems to stay low to the horizon, and a variably slow straight heading.  This is now the 4th occurence I have had so far.  There are only 2 quirks about this I have noticed.  I am now keeping notes of when i see it and what it does.  Then i noticed tonite, that the moon was out, waxing crescent.  The last time i saw it, the moon was at half phase.  The last thing was that soon after I observe the object, a plane or chopper of some type, appears from the direction of our local airport which is southwest of here.  Once that plane is airborne and climbing, the object begins immediately, almost, move in the opposite direction of the plane, until I lose sight of it in a treeline or building height.  Tonite however, the craft was about a ruler and ahalf away from the first plane following(holding a ruler to the sky), then two more planes or choppers(they had a distinct red light on each) joined in, but the object was too far ahead and they seemed to give up and turn due south.  The object still headed into the west, until i lost it in the treeline.  I happen to catch this object when i step out into my balcony for a smoke.  The last thing which i doubt is possible, i took my office sized(3inch) laser pointer with me the third time i saw this object(early last week) and pointed where i thought wsa directly at the object and it suddenly sped up, moving at a constant distance until it disappeared in the trees once again.  Although when i first see the object its moving away from the same location in the horizon each time, which is in between two towers of sorts with 3 red lights each.  The space between is where i first observed the object last month, and i believe i saw it lift from the ground(horizon at that distance), and continually head west as all the other times.  I am 26 yrs old and originally from New Jersey.  I am in the field of Security and i also do some work from home.  I am a deeply studied person in UFO's and phenomenon.  I believe i was in sound mind each of the times I have seen this lit object.  The color of the light that this object is would be a pale yello, leaning towards white, and sometimes will seem to pulsate.  I hope this story gives a good idea of what may be in my home state of Nebraska, which I dont doubt carries many mysteries.  Thank you and keeps your eyes to the skyes.

It was like they were on each end of a bar and just moving slowly from the east sky to the south sky and faded as they got feather away.  No sound at all and at one point they seemed very close, close enough that you should here some thing. I was a very clear night, so maybe a sattlelight, spacestation or something like that?

All of a sudden I seen some sort of beam of light. At first I thought it was lightening, but then I seen something strange, some sort of circlular or octagon shape.  I glanced at the first light, rubbed my eyes and seen the shape kind of light up and it just hovered there.  After about 15 seconds it flashed again and disappeared.  I waited there for probably 20 minutes for something else but nothing showed up.;40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121

It made no noise but was twinklng somewhat.  It was very large and it moved horizontally.   It lasted about 4minutes and faded into the distance.;40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121
Dark S-shaped UFO descended from below the clouds, all the way to the ground, out of sight behind houses.;2014-06-30 03:00:00;2 minutes?;Dark S-shaped UFO descended from below the clouds, all the way to the ground, out of sight behind houses. Okay I swear on my life this happened. It was a few years ago. I guess 2012-2016 because that's the era of my ending-childhood that mixes for me, and I know for a fact it was in one of those years.  There were 6 other witnesses with me, all of which my siblings, all of which a few years younger/older than me. I was outside of my home, standing on my driveway (in the suburbs) when I look up and see it. It's cloudy outside, and there's a distinct thing spinning under the clouds. It was the shape of an S. It reminded my little-kid mind of a worm, but it was the shape of an S. It was dark, dark gray, and more like black. There were no lights or anything. It was falling, but more like descending because it wasn't free-falling or anything. It was a flat S, sitting horizontally in the sky. It was spinning at the rate of like three seconds for one rotation, also horizontally. Me and my siblings all stood on the driveway shouting and staring at it. Our mom heard us from inside and told us to be quiet. For some reason she didn't come out and look?? Even though we obviously were seeing something. We had a theory that it was something for the military, or a foreign military, but that the last-case scenario was that it was a UFO. I've never believed in aliens but I need to know what this was.;40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121

The i look up and at first i thought it was a a drone but then I realized it was clear and had redish yellow lit circles and it looked kind of like clear jelly . I'm not really sure but it flew and it kind of moved in a way that a drone wouldn't move I just kind of flew over my house and head south;40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121

As I headed down my normal route on state fair drive notice what looked like a plane with no tail shoot across sun rise.  As I headed west down road noticed it was closer then I realized it stopped and was floating about 200 feet above me and was a black v shape craft with 5 lights.  It stayed in one spot at I watched it.  No way this was a drone or plane.;40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121
