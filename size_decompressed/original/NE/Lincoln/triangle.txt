I can't believe this craft went undetected for so long!;2015-09-28 00:36:00;~2 hours;I can't believe this craft went undetected for so long! On the night of the Lunar Eclipse, I went outside about half past midnight to get some cool air.  I lit a cigarette and proceeded to scan the sky to see the moon.  The moon was bright in the western sky.  However I looked up to the east and I saw red, green, and white lights blinking in the sky in a triangle shape.   As there is a Skunk Works base not too far south from here I thought it might be a stealth bomber coming in, because it was much larger than say a 727.. which is usally the biggest passenger jet to land in Lincoln.   Once I put my glasses on, I could see a Triangle Craft hovering over the southeast.  I watched it for around 30 minutes before I came inside.  About an hour to an hour and a half later I went back outside... and to my surprise it was still there.;40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121
Large triangle shape, defined by a series of dim lights moving silently and fast.  South to north over Lincoln, Nebraska.;2016-03-18 23:45:00;6 seconds;Large triangle shape, defined by a series of dim lights moving silently and fast.  South to north over Lincoln, Nebraska. I was sitting outside at the patio table with my dog sitting next to me.  The night was clear, and the stars where bright.  I looked down at my dog, her ears were perked up,and she was focused on something in the sky off to the south.  Very strange to see her follow what ever it was until she was looking straight up.  This caught my attention because it's strange for  Dogs, or cats to follow flying objects like airplanes, and helicopters.  I followed my dogs gaze, and directly over me I saw a series of dim lights that clearly defined a huge Triangle, and it was moving North very quietly and very fast.  There were no red or green identifiers or strobes.  The lights did not appear to be on the outside of the object, but more like the dim  light you would expect coming from windows.  My sense was that its altitude was in the hundreds not the thousands because there was a halo effect around the lights due to the moist air.  The Object was perfectly silent. From the time I noticed my dogs ears perk up to the time it vanished off to the north...6 seconds at the most.
