Flying in tryangle formation flew over for 7 seconds not to close but not far away. flew right above us. thouht it could be a stealth but then they all inner changed like a 3 man weave.  But they completly stopped, then did it real fast but not a blur. then it went a little left then slowly faded away? Three of us were talking about a friends death in the family, and how things just don't happen like that, and he was upset, eye's watering when I was layind down on a couch when I saw the object.  I was amazed.  We were freaking out.  I am 19 years old and go to the University.  Anyway it came over the top of us and we followed it allthe way across the sky.  When it was at an angle about 45deg it innerchanged.  The triangel was swithched up.  They all stopped completely and the first dropped to the rear right. and the back left went to the front after circling the other. So did the other one it went from rear right to rear left.  In perfect order and symmetry.  Then shifted to the left without going forward and then went at an angle to the right and then slowly vaded out. There was three of us.  One saw it coming but he was a little tired I'm not sure he saw it.  He was telling us  it was the government.  What ever it was I have never seen somthing like it.;40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121
