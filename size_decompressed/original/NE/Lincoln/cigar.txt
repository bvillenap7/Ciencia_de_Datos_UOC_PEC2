After craft went out of visual contact I got back into my car and within 10 min. the radio station said Omaha listeners were calling the sighting of lights from a strange craft. Police officials were recieving many reports. NASA confirmed the event stating it was only space junk. However, space junk doesn't fly level and I had an excellent observation of the exterior. The craft defied all known physical laws and aerodynamics. The craft made no sound and released a shower of sparks from what looked like a exhaust port. ((FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE FROM WITNESS)) The cigar shaped objects were moving form west to east approx. on a 090 degree heading. I was traveling by car to Salt Lake City, UT when I noticed what appeared to be an airplane on the intermediate approach segment of a landing. I saw three landing lights (believed to be a heavy aircraft) approx. 3 miles away and wondered what airport was in the area. After a moment of thought I realized there was no controlled airport close enough to facilitate a landing. My next educated guess was that it might be a military aircraft flying a low level mission. I pulled my vehicle to the side of the rode and stood at the side watching the lights become three separate objects flying in a wedge formation. To my amazement they were cylinders approx. 100 ft. in lenght with a beam of 15 ft. olive colored with a line of port holes. The light on each craft was on the nose. The had no aredynamic sufaces and made no sound. Captain ((name deleted)) (Airline Transport, Multi- Engine Pilot Rating) ((END));40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121

We were walking in a park at 5:30 and we looked up at the darkening sky when my friend pointed out that there were 3 mysterious flashing cigar shaped objects in the distance. They were headed Southeast and then suddenly changed directions and headed North. The lights flashed yellow and blue alternating every 2 or so seconds. We stood there in amazement knowing that it was a UFO. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121
