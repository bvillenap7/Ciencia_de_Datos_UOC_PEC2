I then noticed a very bright light behind the airliner off to the East-southeast traveling at a constant speed in a straight line towards the commercial airliner. The object was round in shape and was a bright white with a bluesh tint to it. I observed the object chase and catch up to the airliner and fly right above the airliner for around one or two seconds.After the one or two seconds above the airliner,the bright light on the object went out and the object disappeared. I could no longer see the object. It was a clear night with no clouds in the area.;40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121

The dim object was traveling in a straight line to the north east at a very fast speed compaired to the speed of the commercial aircraft in the sky.I observed the object for approx. 45 seconds to one minute.After that amount of time, the light in the object went out and i could no longer see the object.After seeing this i light up a smoke and was scanning the sky looking for more objects. after a few minutes of scanning the sky, i saw another dim lit object in the northern sky heading striaght to the south.The object appeared to be at about the same altitude as the first object I had seen a few minutes earlier. The object was dimmly lit, and while moving to the south,this object was zig zagging and stopping in mid flight and the moving again. I observed this object for atleast one minute before the light in the object went out and I could no longer see it.The sky was clear and no clouds in site during my observations of these two objects.These two sightings occured between 10:37pm and 10:45pm CST.at Lincoln,Nebraska.;40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121

It was fairly small, but not too small.  I definately saw something.  At first it seemed to me that it could be something normal, but then after it moved slowly for about 10 seconds it faded quickly into the sky.  Judging by how far away it must have been, that ship must have been very large.  I think it went back into space quickly.;40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121
Red/orange glowing ball low on the horizen then climbed untill out of sight;2008-11-26 22:45:00;15 minutes;Red/orange glowing ball low on the horizen then climbed until out of sight This is my second email and third sighting of red light. Object was witnessed by myself and 2 other adults. Object again came from the SE moving NW. What was witnessed at first looked like a full moon behind trees but was a very bright reddish orange color. At this time I ran inside to get my camera and my wife stayed outside and watched. I was inside for no more than 15 seconds to get the camera. When I returned outside the object had gone from approximately 100 - 200 feet to about 500 feet and had lost it's glow but was now a bright light about as brighter than Jupiter appears in the sky. The object then moved north and climbed to about 1000 feet. sat there for about 2 minutes then climbed until it winked out. This is the third sighting of the object. First was 8/18/08/. second was 8/29/08. and tonight 11/26/08. The pattern I have noticed if you are to take the first two sightings they were 11 days apart. Counting on a calendar by 11's, 11/26/08 fell on an 11th day. The craft again made no noise. My son living 3 blocks away on a third floor apartment was out on his balcony and called me to tell me he was seeing the object. I didn't have my cell phone on me and he left me a voice mail saying what he was seeing. The time the message was left was 8:45pm (CST). He saw it before I did because he was higher up and didn't have an obstructed view as I did with it behind trees. He described it the same as I saw it. The were Three others with him at the time and they also witnessed it.;40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121

To the east;2009-09-11 21:15:00;15 minutes;I left my apartment around 9:15 PM.  It was dark out.   I walked toward my car in the parking lot of the apartment complex.  To the east (or right of me) was the biggest, brightest white circular light I have ever seen.   The object looked like an intense light with an aura of  lighter light around it.  It was coming right towards me like it was going to land in the parking lot.   The object got bigger and bigger until it was around fifty yards in diameter and fifty yards away from me.    I then went inside my apartment scared and looked out the widow.  It was still hovering in the same place and was the same size.   It then unnaturally stopped and shot straight up in the air super fast and then disappeared in less than a second.    After a few minutes, I decided to go outside again and got in my car.  My neighbor was driving into the parking lot at that time.  As I was telling her what happened from my car, the object reappeared again.   I got out of my car.  The circular white light then moved towards us in the same manner it did before until it appeared it was around fifty yards away from us.   A third witness also viewed the object from his balcony.   The object stopped again and shot up into the sky in the same manner it had before.   We waited a few hours for it to come back but it never did.;40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121
Stationary, circular, metallic, flat object in sky for over an hour.;2009-12-01 14:00:00;90 minutes;Stationary, circular, metallic, flat object in sky for over an hour. NOTE: I am not certain that the year is even correct for this incident.  I was living in Lincoln Nebraska at the time.  I do recall it was winter and I was headed to the mall so I'm assuming it was before Christmas. The skies in the Midwest during the winter are different than the skies in the PNW.  They are always clear and the sun shines, regardless of the deepness of the snow and ice or how low the freezing temps are. Anyway, I was headed to the mall on a flat and very open stretch of road. The area had not been completely developed yet.  I looked up, I saw something circular and metallic looking in the sky...what I'm assuming to be VERY far up there.  I really have no way to judge its distance.  I followed the bend in the road which made it to where I'd be on the side of the object...the object had vanished.  Continued following the road which lead to another bend which put me back in front of the object and there it was.  It appeared to me that it was as thin as a piece of paper to completely vanish when looking at it from the side. I made it to the mall, did shopping and left.  I'm assuming I was there 90 minutes to 2 hours. I took the same path home.  The same round, metallic, flat object was there again.  I'm sure I ended up telling everyone I know the next couple of days and continue to tell people.  I only just found this website this evening or I would have reported it years ago. Truth is I lean more to the notion that it was a portal or wormhole if you will, and with science recently discovering their existence, short appearance and unpredictability, I'm certain that's what it was...but maybe not.;40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121
Bright light over SE Lincoln, 19Jun13 dimmed and flew away.;2013-06-19 22:45:00;5 minutes;Bright light over SE Lincoln, 19 Jun13 dimmed and flew away A Bright light approached from the N NW in the sky moving towards the S SE of the sky. Could tell it was in atmosphere. Movement was strange, moved from side to side in little movements like a feather in the wind.  Was round and bright like a light bulb. It flew above our house.  Was as high up as a small crop duster plane would be at max height. After it passed the house, I shined a powerful flashlight towards it.  Though I doubt it saw it, the object dimmed and became just a round (appeared to be) metal ball, until it flew out of the reach of my vision into the darkness of the night.  It didn't blink at all and made no sound.;40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121
Small orange glowing circular objects floating during the fireworks show.;2013-07-04 21:30:00;30 minutes;Small orange glowing circular objects floating during the fireworks show. There were many circular objects floating from south to north during fireworks.  They were glowing an orange shade and were moving quickly and silently. We recorded the shapes on a cell phone and a small camera.  They would pop up from trees in the distance and simply fly away. Beforehand there was a small airplane flying directly over my building several times.  We did not see the plane during the orange lights. One orange circle floated very close to us but was still far enough away that we couldnt determine what it was.  It was unlike anything we had seen before.;40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121
