UFOs amused by July 4th fireworks over Lincoln, NE?;1986-07-04 23:30:00;3 minutes;UFOs amused by July 4th fireworks over Lincoln, NE? We were at a friend's home a few miles outside of the city limits of Lincoln, Nebraska.  We were looking out at the night sky (there were fireworks going off above the city out in front of us).   We then noticed a cluster of 5-7 lights high above us.  These were DEFINITELY NOT fireworks.  Nor were they stars.  And though I certainly could not completely rule out conventional aircraft, whatever were behind these lights moved (slow, hovering, basically in formation) unlike any conventional aircraft I'm aware of.  They also seemed to be very large.   We watched them for a few minutes and then they were gone.   My feeling has always been that these were 5-7 separate crafts...possibly amused -- or annoyed -- by the fireworks occuring on the ground.  Ironically, my nephew also claims to have saw a UFO on a more recent 4th of July.;40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121
We saw streaks like tracers shoot out from a light in the sky.;1998-08-01 22:30:00;3 minutes;We saw streaks like tracers shoot out from a light in the sky. I was listening to a taped replay of Peter Davenport's appearance on the Art Bell Show on December 11th. In that show, Peter described (and played a tape of) several sightings of lights in the sky that were seen to apparently shoot out tracer-like light pulses. On about August 1 of last year, (I didn't record the date.) my wife and I were sitting on our front porch enjoying the evening, chatting and looking at the stars. I spotted a white light moving very high in the sky and remarked to my wife that I wondered if that was a very high aircraft or perhaps a satelite. There was no sound and, for that matter, I didn't expect any as it appeared quite distant even though it was moving across the sky fairly rapidly. We watched it for 2 to 3 minute during which time it progressed steadily moving approximately eastward. The direction and speed seemed to remain constant. The color and intensity of the light remained stead as well. Then, while we were watching, there appeared to be 3 or four streaks of light, very much tracer-like, extend out ahead of the light. The streaks were fainter than the light of object and extended directly in the direction of travel a distance corresponding to a distance that the object would have traversed in several seconds travel time. This occured twice. Both my wife and I were looking at the object and both of us saw the streaks. The two bursts of streaks occurred approximately 2-3 seconds apart. Shortly after the second burst, the object vanished as though the light were extinguished. The area of the sky that we were watching at that time had no obstructions or other fixed elements that could have come between the object and our line of sight. We watched the area closely for another minute or two, trying to see the object again or anything else, but nothing appeared. We saw nothing more that was out of the ordinary that evening. I am an architect. My wife is a Teachers Aide. We are both in our mid 40's.;40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121
Very bright flash and explosion over Lincoln, Ne., on Thanksgiving.;2002-11-28 22:30:00;1 Second;Very bright flash and explosion over Lincoln, Ne., on Thanksgiving. The only phenomena present in the incident was a sudden very loud report and simultaneous atmospheric strobe.  From military experience, the explosion was very similiar to that of a medium to large caliber artillery munition.  the sound seemed to come from directly over the city.  This was heard by my wife and me and two teen-age daughters.  One daughter was looking out the window at the time and reported a very bright (like daylight) flash of light just before the sound.  Although I suspect a low atmosphere meteor detonation, I am unable to confirm it.;40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121

It was at night so all that was visible were two yellow to orange lights that were side by side, the distance between them is unknown.;2006-03-31 20:50:00;10-15 min;It was at night so all that was visible were two yellow to orange lights that were side by side, the distance between them is unknown.  They seemed to be moving towards us north to south at about tree top level, it's difficult to tell how far away they were because it was dark and overcast and we had no perspective.  As they moved slowly towards us they began to move, as if they were  rotating so that eventually they were aligned one on the top of the other, they then started to move away from us and slowly moved back to their origional position.  Their movement was so in sync and smooth not jerky at all, that perhaps they were attached to one large object.  After a couple minutes of moving away from us they simply vanished.  One more point they or it was totally silent.;40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121
Two yellow lights trailing dropping sparks seen heading slowly south over Lincoln, NE;2006-03-31 21:10:00;2 1/2 minutes;Two yellow lights trailing dropping sparks seen heading slowly south over Lincoln, NE Leaving the mall toward the parking lot we witness two lights flying south about as fast as helicopters would fly. To us they appeared about the size and shape of a yellow street lamp seen from aobut 8 blocks away. They were tailing or dropping what ap[peared to be sparks. My wife saw this first as her eyes are much younger and better. The first craft was dropping these sparks first. Then I witnessed the second one dropping sparks. At first, I thought it was maybe a bomb, or perhaps parachutes. The sparks appeared for only about 2 seconds and then dissipated. It is hard to judge distance, but I would guess they crossed the sky about 2 miles away, maybe more. I called 911 and they checked it out for us. We called back later on a non emergency number and they had no radar records nor were there any military exercises.;40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121
Bright light that changed in intensity and emitted flare-like objects as it traveled towards me.;2006-05-13 22:15:00;Approx 1-2 min;Bright light that changed in intensity and emitted flare-like objects as it traveled towards me. Observed a bright light in the sky while taking my dog out just before bed.  The light was moving slowly and appeared to be an airplane, but what caught my attention was the way it was changing in intensity, not blinking like the normal airplane light does.  As it came nearer, it suddenly shot out to the rear what appeared to be a flare (it reminded me of a fighter jet spitting out chalf to defend against a heat seaking missile).  It did that three times as it approached, and then when it got directly over my house, the light split in two with the appearance of flares, and then was gone.  I realize that this could have possibly been a meteor, but it appeared to be moving to low and slow for a meteor, and the flares coming off traveled in the opposite direction and then dropped down before flaming out.  If it was a meteor, wouldn't all the pieces from the fragmentation keep traveling in the same direction as the main body?;40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121
I tracked a brilliant orange pulsating light moving slowly and silently for a minute, then saw it disappear.;2006-08-29 20:35:00;1 minute;I tracked a brilliant orange pulsating light moving slowly and silently for a minute, then saw it disappear. Leaving the Gere Public Library at 8:35 pm, I saw what seemed at first to be a brilliant orange star in the lower eastern sky.  At that time, only the moon and a few of the brightest stars were visible (the moon was in the western sky opposite from this anomalous light). What caught my eye at first was the unusual orange tint, and as I trained my eyes on it, I saw it was moving slowly westward in my general direction. I wondered whether it could be a plane on a landing approach, but there was no noise and instead of having blinking navigational lights, the light intensity fluctuated (growing gradually brighter and then gradually dimmer every second or two). I continued to watch this pulsating orange light for about a minute, then it suddenly dimmed and disappeared completely. That struck me as very odd, since the sky was without a cloud that evening. I searched that area of the sky for another couple of minutes but the object didn't re-appear. Several other people were nearby, but apparently I was the only one there who noticed this anomolous light. As the light periodically brightened, it would become several times brighter than any star or planet in the sky at that time, including Sirius and Venus, which were also visible during this sighting.  I am a research scientist and medical writer (50 years of age).  I've been skeptical of UFOs most of my life. This is the first time that I've ever seen an unidentied flying object.;40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121

Object then climbed to a very high altitude and was witnessed to be about the brightness of Venus.  Light then faded out.  The object made absolutely no sound.

A light stretching out and then retracting disappears suddenly.;2009-02-06 21:00:00;30 minutes;A light stretching out and then retracting disappears suddenly. While getting into my car with two friends outside of a theatre, I looked up and saw a bright light in the distance.  One friend tried to say it was Venus, but it was MUCH too close to the ground for that. After a minute of observing the object, it stretched itself and then retracted.  After driving one friend home, it was still in the sky, looking closer than before.  After driving another friend home, it appeared to be moving away.  On the drive home, it was still there.  I picked up two roomates to go look at it with me as I had observed it not 1 minute before, and when we went back 1 minute later, it was gone.;40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121

Me and my parents saw a light that looked very much like a star moving quickly across the sky, it had to be low and may have been within the atmosphere, but was not an airplane.

Bright star flashing different colors in western sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a twinkling star.  PD));2009-09-08 22:15:00;40-45 minutes;Bright star flashing different colors in western sky. I was just arriving home from the store about 10:15PM on 9-8-2009 when I noticed my two neighbors sitting outside on the stoop of our apartment complex staring up at the sky.  As I walked up to them I asked, What are you looking at, a UFO?   To my surprise, the gentleman said, I don't know, maybe!    I then proceeded to look up in the western sky and noticed what looked to be a bright star.  The star then started blinking/flashing different colors like red, blue and silver/white.  The thing that was weird was it was flashing these colors all at once like red on top, blue on bottom but flashing very fast sometimes in a steady pattern.  It would flash and strobe red, blue, red, blue, then blue on top, then red on bottom and all of a sudden it would be a solid silver/white light for like 3 seconds, then go back to the red, blue flashing!  At first I thought it maybe could be a satellite but I thought they could reflect the sunlight in such a pattern.  I have NEVER seen anything like this in my life!   I ran inside and grabbed my digital camera to snap a few pictures and by the time I got back outside, two more of my neighbors were also out looking at the star.  What I thought was weird was that every picture I took the star showed up in the LCD screen on the camera but not in the actual photos! (Just my luck!) We continued to watch the weird object for another 25 minutes or so and I noticed that it had been moving away ever so slightly WNW in the sky until it finally was out of our view from the apartment complex stoop.  I started to tell my friends about it over the next few days and I think they thought I was crazy or something.  A few days later, on of those friends came over to visit and told me that they had seen the exact same star that I had described to them earlier that week!!!;40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121
I saw an orange light almost directly above my house, in east Lincoln.

I stepped outside to take my dog out and looked at the sky as I always do.  This time though, I saw an orange light almost directly above my house, in east Lincoln.  It was a little bigger than a star and moving very slowly.  It took approximately 8 minutes for it to get 2 houses down from mine.   Shortly after, it seemed to move directly away from me very quickly as I could see the light getting smaller and fading out.  It didn’t blink like the lights on a plane, nor did it move like a plane or helicopter.  It also made no sound.;40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121

Sorry, but what I reported earlier tonight (within 30 minutes of the event) was apparently just a very steady-burning flare.   I saw another bright orange light later that evening and the second one had a visible parachute that took it drifting in the same general direction as the first light.  The first event occurred at dusk and I guess the lighting was such that a parachute couldn't be seen at that time.;40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121
I saw a bright orange light rise up from near ground-level, hover a minute, and then ascend up into the sky.;2011-07-04 21:53:00;2 minutes;I saw a bright orange light rise up from near ground-level, hover a minute, and then ascend up into the sky. I was just thinking back to a year ago when a UFO was seen over Lincoln, and looking out my window, thinking that the only way I would see one tonight is if one was to appear right outside my window.   At that moment, I saw a bright orange light ascending slowly in the sky, as if it just arose from near ground-level.   I couldn't see it clearly through my bedroom window as it rose higher, so I dashed over to my porch, which offers only a small patch of clear sky to view.  The object hovered right in the small patch of sky at about 15 degrees over the horizon, while fireworks were going off far below it.  It was a bright orange light that was mostly steady but occasionally would pulsate.   As I thought about going inside to get a camera, the object began to move away and within a minute or less, it rose up into the sky and disappeared.   During the entire sighting, I could hear no sound from the object, even when I went out on my porch to view it.;40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121
West to east in the midwest;2013-06-17 22:00:00;2.5 hours;west to east in the midwest My husband and I were walking through southwestern Nebraska streets when I was compelled to turn around and look up. There was a bright, gold, asterisk-looking light moving from west to east across the night sky.  This was last Monday June 17th between 10:00pm and 12:30am central time.   I pointed out the light to my husband and we stopped for a bit to “let it catch up to us” as we were walking in an easterly direction. It moved very fast across the sky too high and irregular to have been a satellite or asteroid. I began talking to it telling the beautiful light that “we're trying to be in peace we know it looks bad with all the war and whatnot, but we really have peace in our hearts.”  Then it stopped and descended very fast and the glow was brighter, with the scatter pattern of light getting bigger and brighter.  I continued talking to this thing/entity/ship/etc.  It moved from east to west every once in a while along its flight path it would wiggle from south to north a tiny bit, and then continue along a very definable straight course. It lasted about 3 minutes, and we have been looking up around that time periodically throughout the last week and they appear to be showing up between the hours of 11:30pm and 12:30 am CST in the southeastern Nebraska area. Unfortunately, our camera is not fancy enough to catch these things anyone have stills or even a video? Please share. Coincidentally, we saw a youtube video tonight of a similar occurrence in Brazil:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmpj7MqBAAk&list=FL02hH42H4ErIA4OQ1twIdpQ&index=1  The one we saw did not come as close, but appears to be similar in presentation, technology and design.  Anyone else seeing these in the midwest over the past 2 weeks?   On that night we also saw 2 lights hover, and then the one nearest to the horizon shot out an orangish-reddish blinking light, or drone, or plane of some sort which then traveled in a southwesterly direction.  It appeared to be cloaking itself as an everyday plane, but we saw where it came out of: the light that at first appeared to be a very bright star.  Over the course of that night, we saw many star ships.  It was unlike anything else I've ever seen.;40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121

I witnessed three spheres of dingy white light traveling at incredible speed south of my home.   At first the three lights were still as though they were stars then the one light furthest to the east began moving eastbound at an amazing speed.  I thought maybe a satellite could be what i was seeing but no way, the object was moving way to fast (to my knowledge).   Then the light furthest to the west did the exact opposite in the other direction but then curved straight up and disappeared into the sky.   The third light remained stationary as if it were a star then nothing after that.I stopped watching and returned inside my home not knowing if what i had seen was ufo or something perfectly explainable.

Before about ten minutes after the event started, the object seemed to move closer at high speed, before turning around and staying in near the same location for around 5 minutes.

A friend, his girlfriend, and myself were standing outside talking, and he pointed the lights out to me at about 02:30.  They were in the southeastern sky (approximately 150 degrees on the compass).   The right and left lights were only very slightly one above the other with the left one being a tad higher.  The left light would wobble back and forth and up and down but the right light was as steady as a rock.  It seemed to be getting closer as we headed inside after watching them for a good ten minutes.   We did not hear any planes passing with in hearing distance.  When we returned outside 30 minutes later we could no longer see the lights.  The right hand light was fairly steady, the left hand light seemed to get a tad brighter and then darker.   I look at stars fairly frequently.  I checked my astrolabe app to ensure the lights weren't stars or planets.  I'm skeptical of it being a ufo, but I couldn't really come up with a good explanation for it.   I wish I had gotten it on camera, but I figured my camera would ((not work well)) in the dark.

23 lights in the early morning sky today.    ((Starlink satellites??));2020-03-03 05:00:00;3 minutes;23 lights in the early morning sky today At approximately 5:00 am on 3-3-20, I saw 5 lights in the eastern sky which appeared very close together on a diagonal slightly from north (lower light) to south (upper light).  As I watched them they were clearly moving downward at an angle (south to north).  I continued to watch this area for a couple more minutes and counted a total of 23 lights, spread out following the same path at what appeared the same speed.  This went on for approximately 3 minutes and then they were gone, too low to be seen. These lights were not moving fast enough to be “shooting stars” nor satellites as I have seen satellites and the ISS moving across the sky.  But, they were indeed moving and were not blinking like planes would either. I don’t know what they were and I can’t find anything online about “objects falling from the sky.”;40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121
