We had just finished that street turned south at the end of the block and then turned east at the next block.  At this point we had not noticed anything.  Then as we were walking up to the 2nd house on the block we noticed this HUGE!! disc-shaped object with lights of different basic colors spinning around the disc.  As it started to clear the house tops and we realized the size, bigger than the house we were walking up to, we were horrified.  My friend ran up under the carport I was too afraid the owners would find us and be mad so I stayed out about 15secs more until it cleared the house tops & starting moving slightly and very! slowly south scaring me enough to the carport.  Still scared between the owners or disc, I ran back out from under the carport just in time to see it hovering basically above us.  It was astonishing, massive, and the lights were mesmerizing.  I can't remember if there was any sound associated with it.  Then once it cleared the trees it shot into space and was gone. We were both horrified and decided it was a Halloween prank.  Neither one of us ever mentioned it again to anybody or even to each other. There is no way in 1975 anyone could put together something of this magnitude. ;40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121
Silver/White disk shaped object seen;1999-03-24 11:57:00;8 seconds;Silver/White disk shaped object seen Driving through NW Lincoln, west on Adams Street towards 1st Street, I looked up and saw an object.  Traveling South/soughwest to the North/northeast, I thought it was a military airplane, possibly a T-38 because I've watched them do touch and go's from the airport, which is approximately 2 miles west from my location.  I noticed that the object was slowing down and at one point during the sighting, the object stopped.  The difficulty of the sighting was that I was in a vehicle and the driving conditions would not permit me to stop the vehicle and go outside.  But while I had stopped and was waiting for the traffic to clear, I looked north and I located the object in between a grove of trees.  I turned north on 1st Street, towards the object.  Directly in front of me, a car was turning left on a side street, therefore I lost the view of the oject.  I located the object once the car had turned, continuing on there was a bicyclist in front of me, so therefore once again my attention was diverted from the object.  When I safely cleared the bicylce, I then located the object once again, and at this time it was moving rapidly to the north/northeast.  The unique feature of this sighting is I believe from my advantage point, when I first saw the object, it would have flown through the Lincoln Municap Airport Corridor.;40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121

Me being 16 years old, I know people usually don't take me seriously.  But, there are those who do.   I was in the countryside of Lincoln riding with a group of kids to the school I went to at this time.   While in the middle seat of the sixteen seater of the van, I was looking out at the window, something I just about always do when riding in a vehicle.   The UFO I saw was, from a side view, cigar shaped, but from my vantage point, I saw it was a disk shape.  It was... moving. I do not know of any U.S. craft that can move like this craft did.  Nor do I know of any disk shaped craft made by the U.S. or any other country.  It was spinning, then it was doing dips, flips, and turns at incredible speeds.  Then, it just seemed to vanish. Like I said, I do not know of any craft from any country that is not just shaped like it or can do what it did.
