Blue disk appears to explode shooting blue light toward ground.;2003-09-15 03:20:00;3-5 Seconds;Blue disk appears to explode shooting blue light toward ground. I was westbound on I-80 west of Lincoln, Nebraska early in the morning of the Sept. 14th. I was watching, what I thought was the planet Mars, as it was the brightest light in the sky to the left of the road. I was wondering where the moon was in relation to it, as I had recently observed them together and this made me start to wonder if this was Mars?  As I was watching this 'light' a large object, either a disk at an angle, or a cigar shape, appeared out of nowhere just below the light. It was bright blue and as quickly as it appeared, blew up? shooting out a blue light toward the ground.  There appeared to be dust or particles left in the area it had just occupied?  All this happened in a very short period of time- almost instantly and startled me so badly, I pulled off on the shoulder of the road to regain my composure.  I still kept looking at the light which now appeared to be pulsing and of different colors. I took out my digital camera and filmed the pulsing light for a few seconds. I took some stills that later showed orbs in the vicinity also.  Vehicles on the other side of the road were stopped also, but continued on before I had a chance to ask them if they saw what I saw.;40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121
Multiple, flashing white lights along south edge of Lincoln, NE.;2004-09-09 21:05:00;5-10 minutes;Multiple, flashing white lights along south edge of Lincoln, NE. I was at home, going out to throw something in the outside garbage, can when I looked up at the stars (very clear sky to the south, although I think clouds were coming in from the west).  At first, I thought it was a group of military helicopters, as they seem to use a white strobe as their only marking at night (at least, I see these from time to time).  Looking at it, though, I noticed that there must be a huge cloud of helicopters, then... because there were a LOT of white flashpoints of light spread over a really what looked like a huge area.  Also, it was perfectly quiet.  I went back in, and got my wife to come out too, so she brought our son and 1-year old daughter outside (I had to make sure that I wasn't the only one seeing this).  My wife and 4-year old son saw it too (my wife was pretty awestruck, like I was... my son was just freaked out).  It may have been one of the freakiest things I've seen.  The whole thing, from when I saw it to when it was too far for us to see, probably lasted about 5-10 minutes (I wasn't really watching the time).  Whatever it was passed to the south of us... most likely just to the south edge of Lincoln.  It didn't change direction or anything like that.  Thinking about it, it looked a lot more like flashbulbs in a dark stadium than strobes.  They were flashes of white light, but the certainly didn't strobe from the same place.  There was absolutely no discernible shape or pattern that we could see.  I couldn't say that there was any opacity to it in any way.  With no noise, and no shape... not much of anything remarkable other than so many white flashes of light, and such a large area.  It was very strange to us.  I checked with the local FAA control tower this morning, and they hadn't had any reports or picked up anything strange.;40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121
5 orange lights in sky create triangle formation, than morph and fade out. Entire neighborhood witnessed.;2010-07-04 22:30:00;3-5 minutes;5 orange lights in sky create triangle formation, than morph and fade out.  Entire neighborhood witnessed. We were finishing up our 4th of july celebration and my fiance and I was getting ready to go to work.  We witnessed 2 orange lights which were very bright in the sky, moving slowly and hovering over some residentials east of us.  This was right over 21st & Superior.  My fiance' and I than went inside to get dressed and my father yelled down the stairs to come up if I wanted to see a ufo. When I got outside, I saw 5 orange lights in a perfect horizontal line in the same area where we saw the 2 a few minutes earlier.  The 2 end lights faded out and than the 3 remaining formed a very large triangle in the sky.  Many people must have noticed because at this point, fireworks in that area completely stopped.  The triangle formation than stretched out and got longer.  The top one than faded away and the 2 remaining lights on the bottom looked as if they began shifting.  It truely looked like the circle lights were almost morphing into a crescent moon shaped light.  Than quickly faded away. My father was snapping pictures as we watched.  I have to wait for him to upload them, but if you email me I can send them to you asap.  :);40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121
Round bright white light, moving slowly and effortlessly to the west, hovered in one area for 45min left in opposite direction.;2013-09-06 02:00:00;45 minutes;Round bright white light, moving slowly and effortlessly to the west, hovered in one area for 45min left in opposite direction At approximately 210 am, a few thousand feet up in the sky, a round non-flashing bright light (no other colors noted besides white) was moving at a slow pace towards the western sky (slower than a one pilot plane).  No other bright stars were present at this time.  The object seemed to hover around that area only to move only back and forth maybe 100ft?  It would move discretely from north and then move again to the south but never making any big move.  It made no sense when it would get dim or brighter either?  It could be stationary for a time and get dimmer then all of a sudden get brighter. (Like when a plane puts its landing gear light on.)  It appeared to be poised effortlessly for 45minutes in that same area only it would dim and then brighten again.  At one point in time there seemed to be a series of flashes taking place outside the object, this lasted only a couple seconds (like picture flashes from a camera).  Also, when the object was dim the shape seeme! d like a teardrop shape?  At approximately 250am the object had moved eastward and was out of sight from my standpoint.;40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121
Boomerang object over 100 feet long and silently glided past my house no lights no sounds.;2013-11-27 21:14:00;15  seconds;Boomarang object over 100 feet long and silently glided past my houseno lightsno sounds Got out of my car and looked up at the stars and noticed a dark shadow from the corner of my eye and when I looked straight at it I could hear no sound or lights, but as it was going by I could see a little relection of city lights on it and it appeared to be between 1 and 3 thousand feet up and it resembled a sort of boom a rang and it appeared to be over 100 feet long.  I could not believe what I was seeing and I seriously was freaking the ((deleted)) out!   As it glided thru the sky it made no noise and I followed it for about 15 seconds and it went beyond the big trees in my back yard.  and I lost it in my sights.  I dont know what it was and I dont think the Air Force would be testing any new planes in a populated area, at least we hope that thats all it was!
