V-shaped lights, which turned red when I stopped to watch it, then flared brilliant white and moved toward me.;2015-12-03 18:00:00;~8 minutes;Vee shaped lights, which turned red when I stopped to watch it, then flared brilliant white and moved toward me. Just at 18:00 hours, I left my place of work and started to my car.  There were only 2 cars in the parking lot, and it was already quite dark.  I looked to the north over the building across the street and saw one V shaped group of white lights (I believe there were 5 lights.  It looked like the object was only a couple hundred feet in the air.  I could also see a larger outline off to the left, which made it a large, horizontal diamond shape. I stopped and watched, and when I stopped, the light immediately changed to red and then quickly flared into an amazingly bright light.  I was able to get a photo with my cell phone, and then it started moving toward me very slowly.  It then began moving toward me faster, and I walked to my car and got in, instantly turned the key and turned the lights on with no problem, looked out the window, and it was simply gone.  I got out of the car to check, and except for stars and planets, the sky was completely empty.;40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121
