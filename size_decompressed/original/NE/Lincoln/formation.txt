orange v formation over lincoln, NE;2000-06-30 21:30:00;10 minutes approximately;orange v formation over lincoln, NE I was a child of 10 when I saw this with my friend. The two of us and my mother were walking to a nearby friend's house a few blocks away at anywhere between 9-10 because it was a dark summer night so it was quite late. Me and him were looking up at the sky and we noticed a v formation of orange objects. They were very hard to see since they were so high up. We had problems just trying to follow them. They didn't keep a strict v formation though. It was very much like birds migrating. They tend to stick in a v but every now and then one would move over to the side or so. We knew they weren't birds since the formations were so extremely high up and glowing orange. My mother couldn't see them most likely since she shrugged it off as child play. We watched the slow moving objects as closely as we could until we got to our destination. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

moving constillation, plus;2005-01-13 05:50:00;approx. 10 min.;moving constillation, plus I work in Lincoln just off of highway 6.  I came outside to start my car to go home when i looked up and seen approx. 5 lights (some brighter than others) flying in formation heading N-NW.  It seemed to look like a constillation in motion!  Then I noticed three more moving the same direction, then at least two more.  I immediately went inside to grab a co-worker to see this.  A total of 4 others seen the same thing as me ,some coming to work and others leaving for the day like me.  We all looked around and noticed that they did move away rather quickly and then noticed more!!!  The Lincoln air port is only about 2 miles from where I work.  No planes were in the sky.  I was initially shocked that we were able to see them so clear since we are surrounded by the city's lights.  I live in Eagle, Ne about 15 miles from the sighting.  And i sure have seen my share of strange lights at night, but I just had to report this one.;40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121
