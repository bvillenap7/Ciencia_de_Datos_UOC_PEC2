The night of the 26th in March I was driving home with my two kids from my regular run in the truck and I saw an extremely weird looking light that was kind of changing shapes on me.  This was about 8:47.  When I continued to look at it, it changed shapes again and I little kind of another alien ship came out of the bigger alien ship.  They were, what it looked like to me firing at each other.  I say this because they continued to shoot beams at each other.  My kids were frightfully scared because they saw the beams hit the ground and they thought they were going to get hit.   These six minutes seemed to last a life time.  They seemed like they were there for more like thirty minutes.  After they were done fighting they crashed into each other and as they fell from the sky the alien ships seemed to disintegrate into thin air.As the alien ships were falling from the air they made a distinct high pitch ringing noise that was one of the loudest sounds I have ever heard in my life.  After this was all over I looked up into the sky, it was very dark outside.  When this ended it was about 8:53.  There was a kind of streak that was looked to be left from the descending alien ships.  It almost looked like a river of dust into the sky that seemed to have evaporated into the atmosphere.;40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121
black object moving slowly in broad daylight suddenly disappears;2005-02-26 17:55:00;3 minutes;black object moving slowly in broad daylight suddenly disappears My boyfriend and I were looking out of the window (west) toward the airport. We live about 3 miles away. We saw an object that appeared black and round moving very slowly away from the airport. The sun had not set yet, so it was very easy to discern the shape at that point. It was traveling east, so it was coming towards us. Within 200 feet, the object spun, and took on a cigar shape. We ran outside to take a closer look, and by the time we got there, it had disappeared. That only took approximately 5-7 seconds. There were no clouds at the time close by. I have never seen anything like that in my life. I called the airport to report it, and was referred to the national guard station inside the airport. The gentleman I spoke with said that there were no test flights taking place, and asked if I had seen a bird. I am a 36 yr old woman, and I believe I would recognize a bird, as there were many flying at that time. If anyone could give me some insight on this, or possibly saw it, please let me know.;40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121
Lights over Lincoln, NE 5-21-06;2005-05-21 00:30:00;20 minutes;Lights over Lincoln, NE 5-21-06 I had to consult my journal to be sure of the time and date of the occurrence.  A little background information: me and a former friend of mine went to Lincoln to do some work for a few weeks and we stopped by the apartment of a girl I was fooling around with. (She lived a few blocks east of the capital building, a huge art deco skyscraper.)  Come midnight, the lights went down on the Capital and we sat out on her porch gazing up at the sky. I noticed a couple of points of light moving slowly across the sky towards each other (as airplanes would if they aimed for each other) except that the lights approached each other and danced around each other and sped away, like a satellite using gravity as a slingshot. They did this dance for a while, this happened for about ten or fifteen mintues, the lights would fade in intensity and suddenly brighten (although this change in luminosity seemed to be a separate phenomenon from the speed of the craft.) For about 15 minutes we observed 2, sometimes three lights (although one light would always be fainter in this case) doing an impossible tango in the sky.  My buddy thought it was fighter jets, and my former girl mentioned that the lights were well above the feathery cirrus clouds, and I'm pretty sure commercial aircraft don't fly that high. One guess of mine is that the lights were caused by craft skimming on the edge of the atmosphere (hte bright bursts of light caused much in the same way as the splashes caused by a water skier bouncing on the surface of the ocean.) Also the lights would travel below the skyline of Lincoln to almost directly overhead within seconds. We could not hear any engines of jets.  We debated this for probably 15 minutes before the lights faded off. As we were about to go inside I spotted a light again. (It was moving parallel to the power lines above where we sat.)  Suddenly the light brightened, and forked apart into seven or eight lights which for about two seconds moved in tandem with each other (horizontally?) before they began to swarm around and forward (like the flying machines moving en masse in the Matrix 3 or the meteors at the end of Contact moving in one direction) and shot up into the sky. (I called Lincoln 911 afterwards, feeling rather foolish when the woman who answered laughed at me.)  Even now I can believe what I saw yet I can't. I am a skeptic through and through (I do not believe in the spiritual, I trust in science) and for me to see something with my own two eyes that not only defies the current laws of physics (or maybe it doesn't, not my field of expertise) for me to actually get a fundamental answer to the question of are we alone was something I never expected. I figured I'd die without answers to anything (or at least the big questions.)  Earlier today, a few of my friends and I got to talking UFOs and someone said I should document what I saw so . . .  Well, not much of a story, but when I looked on here to see if anyone reported anything about it and I saw nothing from 2005, I decided better late than never.;40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121
Bright white light that change formation, had a limited duration.;2007-11-13 23:45:00;less than 2 mins;Bright white light that change formation, had a limited duration. On this day something told me to keep looking in the sky. Looking up in the sky while driving east. I say maybe 700 ft. in the sky. Seen a bright white light, that almost looked like a diamond then my brother said it looked silver to him. then it must of have some type of cloaking device. It looked to have some type of radiation or something and dissappeared.  My brother and I were so amazed by what we saw. I kept asking him if he seen it and he told me yes.;40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121
