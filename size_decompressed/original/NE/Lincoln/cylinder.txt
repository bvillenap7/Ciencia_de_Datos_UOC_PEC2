Cylindrical object with bright orange light.;2009-07-02 21:15:00;5 min;Cylindrical object with bright orange light. While relaxing on my patio at about 2115 hours I saw a cylindrical object in the sky.  It was about 9’ tall and 5’ wide.  It had a bright orange light that changed colors at the bottom and made no noise.  It traveled from east to west near the Lincoln municipal airport.  It traveled very slowly in a steady non changing course.  It was dusk and there were fireworks in the vicinity.;40.7968099834971;-96.6699311056121
