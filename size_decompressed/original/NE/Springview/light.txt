Orange and white lights, moving quickly horizontally;2004-08-24 22:00:00;20 minutes;Orange and white lights, moving quickly horizontally Orange light appears, usually a bright white light then appears near the orange one. They then disappear and appear usually some distance away, sometimes one light, sometimes two or three. Ususall when they reappear they are some distance from the first place, usually in a horizonal line but much to far for a plane or 'copter to be able to move that quickly. The lights are not seen constantly but come and go. Last night it was over a 20-30 minute period. This is the second night in a row we have seen them. Will be looking again tonight.;42.851;-99.802
