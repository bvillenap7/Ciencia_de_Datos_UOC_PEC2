My wife and I were traveling with my father and his girlfriend one night and I noticed a large black triangle shape with red lights at the points hovering over the road. I stopped almost directly underneath it and got of the car, however it made no noise, and was perhaps 200-300 feet in the air, my best guess at size would be 200 yards long. Now for the strange part!, my wife only remembers the lights, my father and his girlfreind dont remember anything! We were on our way to a local casino for a slot tournament, but we were aproximately an hour late for the tournament, even though it seemed we stopped only for a few minutes!
