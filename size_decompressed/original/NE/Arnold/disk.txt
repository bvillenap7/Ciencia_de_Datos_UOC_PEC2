70’ saucer sat above my neighbor’s house.;2021-02-17 06:45:00;15 minutes;70’ saucer sat above my neighbor’s house. For what it’s worth, I thought I’d try making a submission.  Stepped onto the front porch, yesterday morning, to retrieve the paper. So there, across the street, suspended above the neighbor’s house, was a flat circular disc. The underside of this thing, and it was probably seventy feet in diameter, was flat, and perfectly smooth, and dark gray in color. The topside, however, rose from the outer rim to a smooth dome. I guess you could say that it was shaped like a sand dollar.  I couldn’t tell if this thing was metallic, or some other material. As I said, the underside was a dusky gray, while the top was a lighter gray color. As well, this thing looked like it was stuck against the sky. I mean, it wasn’t flying, or hovering, and I wasn’t aware of any sound, an engine sound, or some kind of propulsion system.  So what do you do? I picked up the paper and walked back to the house, to the kitchen, where I casually poured myself a cup of coffee. Honestly, I wondered if I should call my neighbor and let him know that there was this disc, which sat fifty, or so, feet above his house.  As it was, I stepped into the living room and pulled the drapes... and wouldn’t you know, this thing wasn’t there, which left me thinking, so it’s going to be one of those kind of days. The sighting, the initial sighting, followed by the trip to the kitchen, and pulling the drapes, took about fifteen minutes.;41.4456;-100.1567
