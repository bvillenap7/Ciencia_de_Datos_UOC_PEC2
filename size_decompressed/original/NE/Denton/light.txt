Man of Reason fails to explain blinking starlike object with energy bursts;2001-11-12 05:00:00;4-5 minutes;Man of Reason fails to explain blinking starlike object with energy bursts This is the only UFO experience I have had. I am an advanced student of philosophy at an international educational institution. I am uncertain if my senses were decieving me or what, but waking up I saw out of my window what I thought to be a plane traveling at high altitude in a south-westerly direction. The sky was clear. Suddenly the blinking plane stopped. how could that be? I thought to myself. I then stared intently at the star-like object for several minutes. It seemed to me to continue blinking and began to shoot off what seemed to be a multitude of smaller energy bursts. I went to get my telescope, and when I returned the blinking had died down and it looked like a bright star. I find it hard to accept that my retina or some kind of tiny eye convulsions would have caused me to see such a strange spectacle. Thus I am left without a solid conclusion, other than this has never happened to me while looking at stars or planes. (My impression was that it was a gov. observation/probe or some kind of demonic vessel. There are no space aliens. Philosophically, it is impossible that intellences higher than human reason are a physical part of Creation.) ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what it was the witness observed.  It may be the case that he witnessed a tumbling booster shell (ullage) in orbit, but that would not explain why the object stopped moving, if indeed, that is what happened.  PD));40.7391;-96.8395
