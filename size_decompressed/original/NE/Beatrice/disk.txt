4 hours in the sky.....same location.....colored lights;2009-01-24 00:30:00;4+ hours;4 hours in the sky.....same location.....colored lights I noticed bright light to the west of my location.  While watching it started showing light colors of red,blue,and white.  While I watched, it turned so that a circle of white lights could be seen.  Just as quick it turned again showing a triangle shape on the other side, which was dotted with white lights.  This object jumped up and down, left and right but never left the same location.  At 0345 went from this space to a location north of itself, without a trail and within a blink of the eye.  I kept watch until about 0430 at this time it began to fade in what appeared to be nothwest.  When I saw this object I got 2 coworkers to come see this strange object.  My husband also saw this object.;40.2691000000002;-96.7422999999999
