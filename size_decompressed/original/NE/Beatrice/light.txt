I saw a low positioned yellow light that disappeared after a short period of time, haven't seen it since.;2007-03-13 21:00:00;Two Days;I saw a low positioned yellow light that disappeared after a short period of time, haven't seen it since. I was in the parking lot of my apartment building and I noticed a bright light in the western part of the night sky.  It was brighter than any star I’ve ever seen.  It was also lower in the sky than any of the other stars in the night sky.  I ran some errands and it was still in the sky, not moving.  I thought it was strange that it was so low in the sky, telephone poles and trees covered it up, which I’ve never had happen to any star I’ve seen.  I ran into my grandparent’s house to pick up some blankets I left there.  I was in their house for about an hour and a half.  When I came outside the light was gone.  My sister was with me during this time period, and I had mentioned it to her.  She is younger so she didn't really think anything of it, except it was weird when it wasn't there when we left our grandparent's house. 	The next night probably around the same time as last night that same light was there again.  I noticed that the light seemed a yellowish color, as opposed to the other stars in the sky which were white.  It was in the sky for an hour or so longer than before, but it disappeared sometime within that night while I was sleeping.  I haven’t seen the light since then, and I find myself looking for it.  I went and tried figuring out if it was maybe a planet or something that people from Earth can see sometimes.  However, I found nothing that looked like what I had seen.

Light seen in Beatrice, NE changing colors, moving rapidly and producing two others.;2011-08-11 11:30:00;3-4 hours;Light seen in Beatrice, NE changing colors, moving rapidly and producing two others. On the night of the 11th of August, four friends and myself went out to the country to watch the meteor shower.  Around 11:30 we noticed a blinking star. Brighter than all the others. We watched it for a bit then noticed different colors being displayed.  We recorded red, blue, orange, green and white. It would dim down then get extremely bright.  As it got brighter it would shoot down about two or three inches then proceed to do what I can only describe as loop-de-loops.  We watched this object for a good 4 hours before we left. We also noticed that there were moments when the object would become red, extremley bright, and then turn into three in the shape of a triangle.  The two extra lights would then be sucked into the one, then proceed to dim down again.  The object acts as if it were a star when any aircraft passed in its direction by dimming down, not blinking and being stationary. The five of us then left to drop of the other three observers that were pres! ent.  The driver and I then went to a friends house to tell him we had seen something strange but needed him to come with us to justify our experience.  We then took him out to where we were and told him to just look at the 'star'. He then asked myself and the driver if it was moving.  We asked what he saw and he described to us everything that we had observed earlier.  Might I note that no druga or alchohol were involved.  The observers that i was with including myself are all very credible people.  Tonight will be the seventh day in a row that others as well as myself have seen this object.;40.2691000000002;-96.7422999999999
Brilliant Blinding Flash.;2018-07-27 19:30:00;1 second;While driving into town, I saw a one-second brilliant blinding flash in the sky...(like having your eyes temporarily blinded by a flash from an old-fashioned camera at about 7:30 pm in Beatrice, Nebraska on 07/27/18.   After it flashed there was a small dark floating dissipating black cloud.   I believe my passenger saw it too, yet didn't say anything either.  Meteorites don't leave a dissipating puff-cloud of black smoke.;40.2691000000002;-96.7422999999999
