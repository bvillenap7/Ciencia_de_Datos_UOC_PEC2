I witnessed 2 flickering, orange lights over York at two different times.  First sighting was at around 21:00.  Lights flickering quickly and in no discernible pattern.  Watched for nearly a minute as the progressed from south to north before blinking out.   The local fireworks display began shortly thereafter.  Display concluded at appx 22:30 and I sighted the objects again.  The second sighting lasted for nearly 3 minutes as the two craft circled each other, stood motionless for a few moments then parted ways.  One proceeded east until it was out of sight.  The other proceeded north until it had disappeared from view.;40.8679000000001;-97.5805999999998

We went over there and he says are we seeing things or do you guys see this also we saw lights following one another in total of 9 way too close to be an airplane or any other craft due to turbulence. When one would disappear in the front of the line one would appear at the back of the line until eventually one by one they all just vanished and we couldn't see any thing else. Clear sky's no meteor shower acts like that no drones around here.....;40.8679000000001;-97.5805999999998
