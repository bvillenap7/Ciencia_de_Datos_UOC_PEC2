Large flying V- and T-shaped lights.;2015-12-07 21:15:00;1 minute;Large flying v- and t-shaped lights. Outside of my house at approx. 2100 hours, I noticed an object flying at what looked like 20000 feet.  I had no time to photograph.  I ran inside, and got on my computer to find no current flights within 100 miles of my location, and the I.S.S was off the west coast.   There where a total of 7 lights, one wide V shaped, and next to it, a large T shape.  Moving far too fast to be a plane, and too slow to be a satellite;40.8679000000001;-97.5805999999998
