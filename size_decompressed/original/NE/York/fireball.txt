Large round red silent light;2012-06-28 22:15:00;app 1 minute;Large round red silent light On June 28th app: 10:15  P.M. as I was sitting on my deck watching the fireflies I saw a hug red object come floating over, it appeared to be floating and I expected it to start dropping, but it just kept moving to the SW It was almost as big as the moon which was off to the south of it, I heard no noise, there were no flashing lights as a plane would have, just the steady red.  I thought maybe a plane on fire but no flames  just red ball I thought maybe something falling like a meteor etc  but it just kept moving a nice steady speed and no fire trail etc. As it went behind some trees I walked to the road  and got a clear view and watched it until it disappeared into the horizon, this all took app: 60 sec  from the top of my house until it disappeared, this took place over a rural setting;40.8679000000001;-97.5805999999998
A fire ball was moving in the atmosphere while stopping, going, and even changing directions.;2017-05-04 23:34:00;0:18;A fire ball was moving in the atmosphere while stopping, going, and even changing directions. 11:17 p.m CST. (The before situation) This is when I first snuck outside to go stargazing for a while. When I first came outside I began to watch the stars and relax as the last day of school for me is the 5th of May 2017. I see the usual things such as a few shooting stars, twinkling of the stars, and just normal stuff one would see in the night sky. Minutes pass by as my friend and I were talking about the what Earth would look like from space. 11:34 p.m CST.(The Sighting itself) Now at this time I was just glancing around in the sky when I first saw it and pointed it out to my friend. It looked like a meteor at first from a very far distance. This was in the East/South sky, about 75-80 degrees. It was such a bright flash of light compared to other stars and it didn't just go away. For a minute I thought it was just another planet. Then thoughts crossed my mind if it was a man made satellite. It couldn’t have been however. It was moving different directions. First traveling towards the South sky. Then it began crossing in a back and forth motion. It would occasionally stop for a minute or two. Then it would go back up and move in this back and forth motion. At this point I stood up knowing it was not man made, as my friend tracked it, I ran quickly grabbed my high powered laser pointer (10 Mile radius Class 4 green colored) my friend pointed it out and we shone it to see if there would be reaction from it. It did seem to react which was very interesting meaning it must have spotted this light, at least a very low power of it. As soon as i shone at this light, it stopped and stood still. It didn't move for at least 5 minutes. It moved again and I shone at it again. The craft stopped again. By this point my friend and I ran inside and changed and began looking up who records these sightings. 11:48 p.m CST.  (The call in)  After seeing this I began looking for somebody who would take in this sighting.  I googled exactly where to report and immediately called the hotline. 11:50 p.m CST. I told the man at first how i swear it was not a prank call.  I forgot his name (I asked at the end and completely forgot) I explained it as “A fireball looking thing that switched directions in the sky”  It was in more words but if I were not so panicky of giving a 15 second detail it would've sounded better.  He told me to make a report on what me and my friend saw and in a way he could describe it.  Therefore, I made this report in order to show that a sighting is just a matter of paying attention. 12:09 a.m CST. I began writing the report and finally finished at 12:30 a.m .  Thank you for taking note of my findings.;40.8679000000001;-97.5805999999998
