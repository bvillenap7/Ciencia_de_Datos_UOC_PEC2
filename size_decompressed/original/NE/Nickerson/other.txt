low flying semi transparent silent object;2020-04-25 01:25:00;2 minutes;low flying semi transparent silent object as my girlfriend and I were exiting our hot tub, she noticed an object that had a similar shape as a winged drone moving directly over us at a very slow speed in a North East direction at an altitude of @ 25'. the object was semi transparent but a definite outline could be seen. It appeared to move like a stingray in water but without the large motion sweep of its wings. It was obviously not a bird or any other flying animal. The relatively fixed axis of the wings would rule that out the translucent appearance would discount any technology available to the public. It was as if it were cloaked to use a sci-fi term.  It flew so slowly you could have paced it at a brisk walk. there were no lights and it made no noise. wing span I would estimate to be @ 10-12'. there was no clear distinction of a cockpit or fuselage or tail rudder and the object appeared to be flat, yet able to change shape to some degree.  It was almost as if it were an ap! parition. We both witnessed it until it changed flight path slightly and disappeared behind another building on my property.  Our dog seemed to be scared as we entered the house after the event. This would be out of character for him. I don't know if it is related but as we were sitting in the hot tub, the stars and planets did not seem to make their normal path across the night sky. it seemed as if they sat still for @ and hour or so.;41.546;-96.4462
