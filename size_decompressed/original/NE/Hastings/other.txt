The craft was a greyish color, the best description of the shape would be similar to a bus.  No wings.  It appeared as I glanced in that direction. (to the east).  When I looked back, it was gone. My estimation is the craft was approximately 200 meters off the ground and within a couple miles.  I was shocked, there was another car on the by pass in front of me.  I have always wondered if they saw it too.   I know this happened a long time ago, I just never thought about reporting it.
