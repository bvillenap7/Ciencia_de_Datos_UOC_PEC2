((HOAX))  3 UFO's appeared in the space of 15 seconds.;2008-06-16 08:45:00;14-17 seconds;3 UFO's appeared in the space of 15 seconds. I was strolling the lovely town of Hastings, taking snapshots of the beautiful surroundings, when my friend started screaming. ((obscenity deleted)) IS THAT?!?! and we saw two huge spacecrafts, clearly from other worlds. Their buzzing noises and the speed and flashing lights was clearly from another planet.  A 'normal' saucer-like spacecraft appeared first, and a second craft appeared. It was purple, and very long, stretching light years perhaps? I was amazed.  My friend pulled out a camera and went to take this photo, and as he took the photo, a third craft appeared right before the sun.  We heard noises, like they were having a conversation with each other, in some sort of galactic gathering.  The sound was amazing, and then this beam of light was propelled into mountains, like a beam from heaven, as if they were the alien gods, basking in our sweet pristine earth.  Something appeared on the mountains.  A face.  We couldn't see who it was, but we know that this was something of great importance which people had to know ((NUFORC Note:  Hoax.
