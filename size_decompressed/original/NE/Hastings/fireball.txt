Two objects seen falling from the night sky from west to east almost like meteors, they appeared to have a fire trail behind them while falling.  These two objects then slowed from their fall and became bright white lights.  They almost seemed to hover for at least 30 seconds then darted off to the north silently and much faster then any plane could travel.;40.5899;-98.3914000000003
