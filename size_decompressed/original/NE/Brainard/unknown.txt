I stopped my car and got out when I saw an object coming from east-northeast moving west-southwest. It was glowing orange in a cresent shape the size of my fist..void/dark behind the cresent shape then coming back together forming a orange trail. At first I thought it was an airplane with a bad engine. Then I thought it could be a very large asteroid. However it moved across the sky without desending,completely silent, taking about 2-3 minutes to cross the sky... horizon to horizon.;41.1794;-96.9886
