UFO along highway 34 Hamilton Co., NE.;2018-10-12 21:50:00;10 minutes;UFO along highway 34 Hamilton County, Nebraska On Friday October 12, 2018, my daughter and I were driving to Grand Island, NE to go shopping, at approximately 21:45 near the Iams plant on Hwy 34 we noticed an object in the sky with flashing red and white lights that was going North (could not tell what shape it was) at first we thought it was a plane but it was flying too low and then it stopped and made a 90 degree turn and headed west along highway 34 toward Grand Island.   As we were driving, we got to an area of houses called Sunset Terrace the objective was hovering above the houses, it looked like it had 2 headlights on then it completely turned around and disappeared my daughter took a video of it which only looked like a street light in the video, her phone did not work right after capturing the video for at least 15 minutes.  While driving to Grand Island after Sunset Terrace we saw the object again going Southwest.   At approximately midnight on our way home we noticed several of these objects in the skies all along highway 34.;40.8957;-98.2087
