I was driving to meet a friend for his birthday and I noticed out of my car window on highway 275, just above the tree line, a hovering object, probably a half mile a way.  I slowed down my car, though could not come to a complete stop due to traffic.  My thought upon first glance was that it must be a cropduster plane or something and that it looked stationary because it was coming in my direction.  I discovered, though, that it wasn't moving at all--it was hovering, and did not look anything like a plane.  It had somewhat rounded top like a tradional UFO drawing, but had sides that seemed to come down at about a twenty and then seventy degree angle (rather than the disk).  I looked at it as long as I could, but then it disappeared.;41.2677;-96.314
