It was dark.  We were in the car.  The car was not running.  Out of no where, a very bright light shined in the front windsheild.  It seemed to be on top of the windsheild.  It lit the inside of the car with a very intense white glow.  After watching the light not move for about 30 seconds,  I jumped out of the car thinking somebody was shining a flashlight in the car as a prank.  There was no one around.  Keep in mind that we were in the middle of the Nebraska countryside.  There was a feeling of horror that came over the both of us.  I've told a few people about this but they think i'm crazy or making it up.  I don't care,  I know what I saw.;40.0944;-98.5146
