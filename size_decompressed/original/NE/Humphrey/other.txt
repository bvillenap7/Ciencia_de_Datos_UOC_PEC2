PD));2011-01-01 20:00:00;1 hour so far;1/1/2011 Multi-colored flashing lights on an object that hovered for over an hour in the N.E. Nebraska area. At approximately 7:45 pm we saw a strange light in the eastern sky.  It appeared to be blinking different colors:  red, blue, green, and white.  It hovered in place but appears to change from what appears to be a ball but then oval.  With the assistance of binoculars the lights appear to be like stage lights in intensity.  The Center of the object is intense in light but the oval area appears 'foggy' but with light.   The object appears to tilt at times with a beam of light shooting from and drawing back in straight line.  The line of light was witnessed once.  As of 8:50 it is still there.;41.6702;-97.4986
