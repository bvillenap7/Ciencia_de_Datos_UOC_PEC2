SMALL PIECES, TURNED COLORS, AND BROKE INTO THREE PARTS THEN SHOT ACROSS THE DARK NIGHT.;1994-06-11 01:30:00;1 MIN;SMALL PIECES, TURNED COLORS, AND BROKE INTO THREE PARTS THEN SHOT ACROSS THE DARK NIGHT. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE A SHOOTING STAR, BUT AS I SEEN THE OBJECT IT SLOWED DOWN AND BROKE INTO THREE PARTS.  THE THREE PARTS TURNED DIFFERENT COLORS, NOT LIKE ANY COLORS I HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE. I HAD SLOWED DOWN TO 15MPH BUT WHEN I NOTICED IT SLOWING DOWN I JUMPED BACK INTO THE CAR AND TOOK OFF AS FAST AS I COULD.;42.1198;-96.3543
