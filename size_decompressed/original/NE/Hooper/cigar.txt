Me and  son were outside, when large object came toward our house.  As it got closer, it turned away from us, about 100 yards away.   It was white shaped like large airplane, but had no wings, and made no noise.   When I focused on it my eyes were blurred, like I wasn't supposed to see the tail, because I could not make out the end of this object.;41.6414;-96.5232
