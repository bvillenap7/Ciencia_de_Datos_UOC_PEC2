I was driving home and I saw a aircraft with a light projecting down on a farmstead one mile to the west of the highway.  I pulled over to the side of the road to watch.   The ac moved slowly to enter the traffic pattern of the airport that was about a mile to my east.  I thought it was going to land so I got back into the car and started driving to the airport to see what it was.   It just flew a low approach and flew over REA Hill in Tekamah.  At this point it took straight up faster than a F-4 Phantom.   When it was even with the stars it stayed stationary and just shut off its lights.  Absolutely no sound when hovering, flying very slowly, and climbing.   The AC had the red, green, and white lights and seemed to follow flight regulations when entering the flight pattern at the airport.    Just wondering if someone else has seen this type of ac.    Any ideas?? ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date above, to reflect a date during the Fall of 1980.  PD));41.7855;-96.2301
