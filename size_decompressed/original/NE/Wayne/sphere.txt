I was comming home from Omaha with 2 friends.  We went to a concert and left early.  As we were pulling into wayne, about 2 hours north of Omaha, I was hanging out the window because it was really cold and we were playing a game.  I looked up and saw a sphere like light that moved across the sky and stopped, then went in the opposite direction, then disappeared.  I had told my friends and we pulled over and by the time we pulled over it had vanished.  It was probably 1000ft.up in the air, and was very bright.  It was probably a one of the coolest thing i had ever seen.;42.2318;-97.0126
