Black Triangle 100 feet above my head.;2010-07-14 23:50:00;2 minutes;Black Triangle 100 feet above my head. At 11:50 P.M. on July 14th, 2010, a  silent black triangle hovered past my dad's house, less than 100 feet above my head.  Traveling around 3 miles per hour, the craft headed eastbound.  As we stepped out of the car, I spotted this UFO and my cousin ran to the front door of the house scared while I walked and jogged, following the craft for about 2 minutes.  This black triangle had rounded tips with extremely dim lights at each tip.  From the front tip, to the base of the triangle it was about 45-50 feet.  The base of the triangle measured around 30-40 feet.   Thank you, enjoy this awesome sighting!
