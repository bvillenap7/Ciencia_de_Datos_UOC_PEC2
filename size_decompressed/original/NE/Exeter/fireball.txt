I walked out of the house, facing to the south and in the sky was a round fireball or light.  It was a reddish pinkish glow.  At first I thought maybe it was a helicopter because it seemed to be flying horizontally (unlike a falling star), but it was too pinkish to be a helicopter light, and a little too big.  I kept watching, hoping my husband would get to see it.  It seemed to come towards us, but yet that it was far away and then it just was gone.  Is there an explanation for this?;40.635;-97.4373
