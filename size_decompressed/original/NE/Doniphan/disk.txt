I was taking pictures of a crop duster and object appeared when photos viewed.  ((NUFORC Note:  Bird??  PD));2004-07-20 20:00:00;IN PHOTO;I was taking pictures of a crop duster and object appeared when photos viewed. On July 20 at 7:30 p.m. a crop dusting plane was forced to make and emergency landing, on the highway, as he ran out of fuel. Fuel truck was summoned and he was refuled in short order. At approximately 8:00 p.m. the plane took off and circle. I took numerous photos and when later viewed an object appeared in the photo that I had taken when plane was in the southeast sky. The sun was at my back. One object was seen in photo. I was with two other neighbors and we had not seen the object. I think we were just concentrating and excited about the cropdusters near miss with catastrophe. Crop duster had a 450 H.P Grumman Craft and we did not hear any other aircraft sounds. I will send complete set of photos. ((NUFORC Note:  In our opinion, the object may be a bird.  Just a guess we do not know for sure what the blurred object is.  PD));40.7733;-98.3772
