It was stationary and he pointed it out to me.  It took me a second to find it in the sky.  Once I did, it seemed to become  slightly brighter.  It was to the northwest of our location.  This occurred for approximately 2-3 minutes.  It moved rapidly seemingly to decreasing altitude (lower), then moved to the west and then to the north quickly before disappearing.  Total time of occurrence from spotting to disappearance was approximately a little over 3 minutes.;41.3596;-96.1566
