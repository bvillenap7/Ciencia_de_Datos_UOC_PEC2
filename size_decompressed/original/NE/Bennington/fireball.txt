We just got done watching our neighborhood fireworks that started at 10:00pm.  Some of the neighbors continued to light fireworks and one exploded in the air and there was this flashing red ball that kind of looked like it was on fire.  It was moving really slow traveling west.  It was low and almost looked like it was going to be hit by some fireworks.  We were talking as a group about it and turned and looked and it was gone.  No one saw it leave.;41.3596;-96.1566
