A bright light seen in the sky, when observed through binoculars seen as a bright light surrounded by three to five others;1997-07-05 00:00:00;5-10 minutes;Summary : A bright light seen in the sky, when observed through binoculars seen as a bright light surrounded by three to five others, hovering and then moving to another spot My friend and I were observing stars andsatellites after lighting our fireworks.After tracking a satellite for severalminutes, we observed a growing light in thesky.  It seemed far away, and looked likethe landing lights of a plane.  Werealized, however, that that was impossiblewhen we realized that it was not moving, andcouldn't be a helo that was hovering as itbeen there several minutes and was soundless.I am a pilot and would have been able toidentify whether or not it was a plane whenI looked at it through my binoculars.  Itappeared as a bright, central white lightsurrounded by smaller lights, not like thewingtip lights of a plane but completelyaround the central light, being of blue,green, and red color.  I noticed throughthe binoculars that the object would moveslowly, stop, then move again.  I sawsomething like this earlier (around July 2nd)and read in the paper about observers inLincoln on a lake and how the UFO they sawput out their campfires before taking offin the realtive direction of my town.  I ama very scientific, rational person, and justwant to know what it is I have been seeing.I would appreciate any and all the help youcan offer.  Thank you.;40.6201;-96.9658
100 high altitude lights traveling across the sky traveling fast for 15 mins.;2019-11-24 06:00:00;15 minutes;100 high altitude lights traveling across the sky traveling fast for 15 mins. They came from the southwest at high altitude going pretty fast.  No marker lights.  No shapes that you could distinguish.  Just balls of light following each other above usual plane altitude spaced out miles apart going north west in a line.;40.6201;-96.9658
