(big blue river )i have never told anyone about what i seen and i mean nobody! 17 yrs ago,dont remember what month other than in the fall of the year probably late sept or nov.i know this because it was deer season.i was walking back from my deer stand, didnt here anything but a gust of wind, turned around and saw a vee or triangle shape object touching or almost touching the ground, dont know for sure because it glowed so white it almost looked blue.it landed in an clearing where the power company had transmisions lines runing through it,the clearing was about 50 or 70 yards wide.  i was hideing behind a tree scared witless, just watching, seen nothing come out or heard nothing.but what i did see was a arc of power comeing from the power lines to the to this object, lasted about 10 min i think.when done it lifted a little off the ground for about 30 seconds rose up past the power poles makeing no noise, and headed southwest fast, lost sight in seconds.  the next day i went back just to look and seen nothing but grass that was laying flat.i still wasnt going to tell anyone about this till i heard your show on radio,  kfab omaha neb.j ust thought you may like to know.
