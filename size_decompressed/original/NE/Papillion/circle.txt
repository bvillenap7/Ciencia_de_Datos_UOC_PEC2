Birght amber-orange fire ball drifting across the sky;2010-07-04 21:00:00;10 Min;Birght amber-orange fire ball drifting across the sky at 21:00Hrs on July 4th while we were setting off some fireworks in our neighborhood.  I looked up to see a round object amber to Orange in color the Light was very high Quality in that it was very bright and seem to be on fire.  This object drifted from west to north east at a very slow rate.  I have been in the military for 20 years and I work around aircraft.  I know what a plane looks like and this was not anything I have seen before.  The color of the light does not match any lighting system I have seen on any aircraft.;41.1504608695652;-96.0333239130435
Two adults went out on the deck to view neighborhood fireworks. Fireworks were being set off to the north and to the south of the deck.;2012-07-04 22:00:00;45 minutes;Two adults went out on the deck to view neighborhood fireworks.  Fireworks were being set off to the north and to the south of the deck. West view was  a clear sky view.  Winds were ESE at 21 mph.  First sighting was of two amber 'orbs' moving high up at a fast pace in formation.  Over the next 45 minutes (we came inside at that time) we witnessed at least 15 of these coming from the South direction heading towards the north.  They were varying distances from us. Some were much more close up than others.  Distinctly NOT planes.    We had binoculars and a phone camera.  It was too dark, even with low light settings to get any pictures.  Through the binoculars, there was a round, glowing shape.  They seemed to be more red in color the further away they were and more orange/amber as they got closer.

UFO sighting in Papillion Nebraska on 9/28/17;2017-09-28 18:28:00;60 minutes;UFO sighting in Papillion Nebraska on 9/28/17 While playing in the front yard, I glanced up and saw a glint off an object in the sky.  What appeared to first be an airplane, turned into what I thought was something falling from the sky...maybe a balloon.   After five minutes of looking at the object, I had my wife give me the camera (Canon EOS Rebel T6i camera with 250mm lens) to take a picture.  Snapped a few pictures and zoomed in on viewer to get better idea.  Could clearly see light within what appeared to be translucent object with glowing lights within.  Had wife come out and look too.   Invited neighbors out to look.  Tried to look at object with a telescope however, cirrus clouds were beginning to block the field of view and sun was going down.  However, despite the sun going down, object appeared to be glowing in the sky.  Decided that object was approximately 70,000-80,000 feet based on clouds.   Object was slowly moving south.  Upper level winds were 270/80, so a weather balloon would not have been moving in that direction.   After about 90 minutes, too many clouds were obstructing the view and darkness set in.  I tried contacting two local news stations (WOWT & KETV), but neither seemed interested.  I sent one of them a picture, but have not heard anything.   I am not clicking that I wish to be contacted by an investigator.  However, if something comes of it, I'll certainly talk to someone to give more details.  It was cool to see and certainly would like more of an explanation as to what the anomaly/phenomenon was.;41.1504608695652;-96.0333239130435
