we observed the first object moving from WSW to NE.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-18 21:15:00;30 minutes;At approximately 9:15 PM this evening, while sitting out on the back deck of our house, we observed the first object moving from WSW to NE across the night sky.  From observing the ISS over several years, this definately was moving at a speed that far exceeded any commercial jet.  About one minute later, two more appeared about 10 degrees apart and following the exact same flight path.  Over the next 25 minutes, approximately nine more appeared, all following the same flight path and crossing the night sky at the same speed.  I've never observed multiple objects like this before that appeared at the same location in the sky, transit in the exact same direction and at the same high rate of speed.  All appeared as singular solid lights, with a couple of them almost as bright as the ISS.  No flashing lights or changes of color were observed.;41.1504608695652;-96.0333239130435
