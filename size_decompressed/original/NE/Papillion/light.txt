The lights started moving slowly to our right, and then went out, kind of like turning out a light. Me and my two best friends were sitting out in my back yard, because we wer having a sleep over, at around 10:00 p.m. We had got a nice conversation going, when all of a sudden Kim, one of my friends, pointed out toward the sky. Me and Megan turned our heads. Staring in amzement we saw five big, bright lights, too bright to be stars. We all noticed that the lights were arranged as the points of a pentagon. I belive that there was only one object. The lights moved rather slow to the right, then disapeared. It all seamed so fast. Right after that we ran inside, and started writting stuff down, like the time, the shape of the lights and other stuff. I remembered my dad, and my brother talking about a contest, and how they were stuck on a question. thats when I noticed this report place. I ran to the basement turned on the computer and came here.      My two friends as far as I know are very trust worthy. I have known them all through elementary school.;41.1504608695652;-96.0333239130435
Observed unusually bright object moving in conventional orbital pattern but not listed in online satellite resource.;2002-08-03 22:15:00;10-15 secs;Observed unusually bright object moving in conventional orbital pattern but not listed in online satellite resource. Saturday night, August 3rd, I decided to go outside into my backyard and do a little star gazing and see if I could see any satellites passing overhead.  My 'window' of observation is rather confined because of large trees in the yard. The back of the house also blocks views to the west, as well.  In addition, clouds were just moving in from the northwest and beginning to obscure the sky. I did, however, have a good clear view of the sky immediately overhead with Vega shining brightly.  I decided to grab my binoculars and folding cot and enjoy the night air for a few minutes. I had just laid down and gotten comfortable when I noticed a 'star' of nearly the same magnitude as Vega and just to the southwest of it.  However, this star was moving.  I quickly put the 10x50 binoculars on it, but it still remained just a single bright point of light.  It was moving on roughly a south to north track at about the same speed most satellites move, but the unusual brightness suggested to me that this wasn't a conventional satellite.  I've observed the International Space Station pass overhead and it was comparable in brightness. As I watched the object move further north, it faded out as it moved behind the thickening cloud cover.  I quickly took note of the time and went online to www.heavens-above.com, a web site that provides orbital observation information on hundreds of space objects from the ISS to Russian space junk.  I found no objects that coincided with the time, magnitude [brightness] and track of this object that would have been visible from my location. Whatever the object was, it was unusually bright for a satellite though it certainly exhibited most of the other characteristics of a conventional satellite.;41.1504608695652;-96.0333239130435
20-25 floating lights lasting about 10-15 minutes;2012-01-08 20:00:00;15 minutes;20-25 floating lights lasting about 10-15 minutes At approximately 20:00 on 1/8/12 we observed floating lights between 20-25 total moving east to west.   Have video and pictures.   Was reported to local news stations and no follow up was done from them.   The lights did not look like flares, asked military friends who confirmed it look nothing like flares since the lights were floating across the sky.;41.1504608695652;-96.0333239130435
