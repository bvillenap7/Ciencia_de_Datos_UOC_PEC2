The light on the object was circular, I could tell it was attached to a a craft but couldn't see a craft because it was dark outside. The object was roughly 50 feet to 100 feet above my car, and as it passed over and I went to slow my car down to catch a glance, the object vanished before my eyes. The car behind me slowed down, I'm guesing he saw it too, however I didn't not turn around to ask him what he witnessed. The object made no noise.;41.1504608695652;-96.0333239130435
