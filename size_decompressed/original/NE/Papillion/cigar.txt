Chrome-like cigar w/ wings, quiet, low flying in unusual flight pattern, with no identification markings.;2002-06-09 17:00:00;3 min;Chrome-like cigar w/ wings, quiet, low flying in unusual flight pattern, with no identification markings. Sitting on balconey @ approx 17:00 hrs. on 06/09/02 saw a low flying, very quiet, cigar shaped object with wings. Especially unusual: 1. Made no sound while passing over head, but had a low hum after passing 2. Direction: straight South to North. 3. Very shiny as chrome in the sun. 4. NO markings, numbers, or any other identification of any kind. 4. Very low flying, much lower than even most private aircraft. 5. Watched as object very slowly moved North, then through a cloud, reappeared, then went through a larger cloud and NEVER appeared again. Have never seen an object like this in size, shape, color, flight pattern, etc. Do live by an Air Force base and commercial airport, but still have never seen anything like this. This is the first time that I have ever reported a sighting of an unexplained object in the sky. I was moved to report this as it was so very unusual. So...a military aircraft or other man made object?;41.1504608695652;-96.0333239130435
Two cigar shapes traveling the same direction and speed and aproximately one mile away.;2007-03-20 09:00:00;30 seconds;Two cigar shapes traveling the same direction and speed and approximately one mile away. UFO Report  In March or April of this year while walking in a local park, I viewed two objects in the sky that I could not explain.  I am a retired USAF officer, pilot, with over 60 years of flying.  I have seen weather balloons, space shots and most everything else that you see in the air but these two objects remain a mystery to me. 	The objects were cigar shaped, pure white and made no sound, size is relative to how far away they were.  If the objects were about the size of a general aviation aircraft then they were approximately 1 mile from me and at an altitude of 1000 to 1500 feet and moving at a speed of about 150 mph..  Both objects were moving south at the same speed and direction with one behind, slightly further away and slightly higher than the other, what I would describe as a Navy formation rather lose.  The color of both was the same, pure white with no markings or variation in color that would be caused by shadows.  There were no wings to be seen and no protrusions above or below them.  The shape was the same for the top as the bottom and the edges were well defined.  I observed them for about 30 seconds until they went behind a near by tree.  Once I walked past the tree they were no longer to be seen.  The three things that I canâ€™t explain are the lack of any sound, the lack of protrusions above or below and the uniformity of the color. 	The weather conditions at the time of about 9:00 AM were clear with an overcast at around 5000 feet and visibility of better than 10 miles.   My eye sight and hearing are very good, I passed an FAA flight physical just two weeks ago and still fly on a weekly basis.	  	I have looked at some of the reports for the same time period and two seem very close, one reported 3-17-2007 posted 4-27-2007 from Hayward CA. And the other reported 3-27-2007 posted 4-27-2007 from Stanford CT.;41.1504608695652;-96.0333239130435
