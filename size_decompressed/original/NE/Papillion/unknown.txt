Bright light behind a haze changed from white-ish yellow to blue colors.;2008-06-23 23:10:00;seconds;Bright light behind a haze changed from white-ish yellow to blue colors. I was sitting on my front porch looking down at the ground in deep thought when a bright light in the sky straight ahead of me caught my attention. The light was very bright white-ish yellow as if it were a street light. I could not see an exact shape as this light seemed to be behind a haze. Within 3 seconds of looking up at the light it switched to a medium blue color then bright blue-ish white and then back to the medium blue color. As soon as the light started to change to the blue color it took off in the sky heading north and disappeared within 3-4 seconds. There was no sound as this happened. I would like to point out that the light was not in the sky when I first stepped out onto my porch. I would also like to point out that I live not too far from Offutt AFB & I see airplanes pass over my house all the time. This was not an airplane. This took off in the sky much faster than any plane I have ever seen.;41.1504608695652;-96.0333239130435
