I live in central Nebraska, slightly east of North Platte.  Last night on the 4th of July 2013 my small town had their fireworks celebration.  As I was watching the fireworks, I noticed several red lights that at first I thought were embers, but they were too high and traveling at a high rate of speed way up in the air. I noticed these strange lights about 4 separate times over the course of the fireworks show.  Several groups of 3 or 4 of various sizes together and two single objects.  They were a bright red color and looked like an air plane would look up in the air except for they seemed to be traveling much faster than an aircraft usually does and they only had a red color to them.  Airplanes usually have several colored lights on them that blink.  These craft were red in color only and the light did not blink, it stayed the same intensity. I was thinking that they must be meteorites or something and then later on that night I listened to the C2C show on YouTube and heard the report that people are seeing these strange red lights in the sky all over the country.  I wish I had taken my camera because they were very plain to see and it was a clear, cloudless night here in Nebraska.;40.94;-100.1634
