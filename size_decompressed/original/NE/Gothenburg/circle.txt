I saw a red round flashing light similar to a taillight on an old car.  the object traveled completely across the clear sky from horizon to horizon, i believe east to west in about 30 to 45 seconds.  there was no sound, but i knew a jet could not cover that amount of space in less than a few minutes.  i told a friend in denver colorado and she told me some people called a radio station to report same incident.
