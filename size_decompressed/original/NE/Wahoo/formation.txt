Lights in night sky over Wahoo flying in formation.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-18 23:00:00;3-5 minutes;Lights in night sky over Wahoo flying in formation Around 11 pm on 4/18/2020 as I was outside I looked up at the stars and seen what appeared to be 6 or 7 lights which looked like stars flying in a straight line formation.  As theses lights began to pass my position I noticed what I believed was the first light in the formation turn suddenly right.  All the lights appeared to be moving very fast.  The lights came from the direction of Lincoln and were moving in the direction of Cedar Bluffs.  The one light that suddenly broke formation turned in flight on a dime and flew towards Mead.  I had assumed that these lights had something to do with the sightings in Colorado and the panhandle area of Nebraska.  These lights made no sound but moved extremely fast.  At the time I saw these lights my iPhone was not on me but in my home and the lights moved very quickly out of site so I would not have had time to get to my iPhone in the house.;41.2093;-96.6141
