100s of lights moving in formation, and joining in from the sides.;2019-12-10 06:11:00;20 min;100s of lights moving in formation, and joining in from the sides. At approximately 06:11, on 12/10/19, I stepped out to smoke a cigarette, like I do every morning.  I looked up to catch sight of the meteor shower, and to look for satellites.  This is something I do every morning, when getting my kids ready for school. As I watched, I noticed what I thought was a satellite going from the North West, to the South West. I then saw another, behind it.  I thought I was lucky, and able to see 2 satellites at the same time.  I then noticed, that there were a string of them ahead of the 2 that I originally saw.  They kept popping out of the sky in the same spot, and going off into the horizon. I started counting, and looked closer at them through a pair of binoculars.  They were Oval in shape from what I could see, No flashing lights, just what seemed to be a reflection of sunlight.  I couldn't get a very clear view of them through the binoculars, and wished I had a better way of seeing them.  There were over 100 that I saw, but they were already flying over when I went out, so I don't know exactly how many there were. My neighbor came home, and I asked her to look up.  She also saw them.  Starlink would not have them joining in the formation from the sides, like some of them were doing.;41.1832833333333;-96.0738166666667
