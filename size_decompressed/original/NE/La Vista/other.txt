I was unloading the 4-runner and looked sse and noticed a very bright light that seemed to get even more intense and puse back to just extremely bright. Colors at the center changed quickly. Blue,red,silver,orange. It was like a jewel or prizm spinning. It was low on the horizon, not moving, I got my girl friend out side. Then I noticed that 3 more of these objects had the same type of colors pulsing but not nearly as intense as the lowest one. They were far lower in the sky than stars you could discern easily. The three lower intensity ones emitted a gold to bronze color so at first I thought them to be satilights and went back to watching the lowest and brightest one. They were all in a formation of a square. The brite one at 10-15 deg obove horizon and the one on the right was to the lower right of Orions belt. Suddenly they came together and went back as quick as the shutter of a camera could click. They must have covered thousands of miles and back to their original formation in a split second. Now the lowest one got even brighter and looked like the Christmas star depicted in drawings with the rods of light or energy being expelled in every direction at the same time the other three seemed to mellow to a redish-gold color like they were cooling off. I called 911 and asked the dispatcher if any one else had reported an unusual event in the SSE sky and she told me no. I know what I saw.;41.1832833333333;-96.0738166666667
