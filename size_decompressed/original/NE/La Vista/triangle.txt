Triangular Ufo in Bellevue?;2007-09-30 00:25:00;2 min;Triangular Ufo in Bellevue? I was driving home from work. I was on Harry Anderson heading south towards Harrison. I saw a bright floresent light right above the interstate overpass. I thought it was a little plane, but it wasnt moving. As i got closer i could see a green light on the left and a red light on the right. The object was triangular shaped with one bright light in front. I turned down the radio, rolled down my windows and stuck my head out just to see if i could hear a plane engine. There was no noise. It just hovered there in one spot. As i got to the red light i turned around in my seat to see if it was still there and it was gone.;41.1832833333333;-96.0738166666667
