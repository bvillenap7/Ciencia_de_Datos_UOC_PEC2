A red fireball hovered over Milford Nebraska.;2010-07-04 22:00:00;30 minutes;A red fireball hovered over Milford Nebraska. We were watching fireworks when a red fireball appeared in the sky.  At first we thought it was fireworks but it just hovered in the eastern sky and came over the top of us.  Then it went straight up in the sky out of sight.  Then we saw it in the western sky. It was much higher this time and it went across the sky and was gone.  This lasted for about 30 minutes and it didnt make any noise.  It was simply amazing the way it bounced around in the sky.  It made moves that unlike any aircraft Ive seen.;40.7656;-97.0603
