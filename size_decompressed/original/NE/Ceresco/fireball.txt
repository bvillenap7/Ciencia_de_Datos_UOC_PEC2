A fireball behind a unknown shape craft over Ceresco Nebraska traveling at a high rate of speed.;2010-05-29 22:00:00;5 min;A fireball behind a unknown shape craft over Ceresco Nebraska traveling at a high rate of speed. On May 29 at 2200 hours while watching TV my wife, daughter and I saw what apperared to be a fireball traveling in the western sky from south to north at a high rate of speed.  There were other aircraft in the sky so we could jude the speed of the craft by that.  The fireball at the tail of the craft was very large and there was no sound, I have been in the military and I am currently in Lawenforcment and I have never seen anything like this.  It wasnt a shooting starr or anything like that. I estamate the altitude to be between 5 and 10 thousand feet.   This was truley a weird deal maybe there have been other reports.;41.0707;-96.6436000000001
