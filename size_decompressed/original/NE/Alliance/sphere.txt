Intense light forced me off the road.  ((NUFORC Note:  Anonymous report.  PD));2021-02-14 03:00:00;20 minutes;Intense light forced me off the road. Blinded, I drove the darn car off the road. Using my left hand, I attempted to shield myself. Raised the hand in front of my face, and could clearly see the bones, fingers, wrist, part of the forearm. So I hit the goddamn brake, and slid onto the shoulder. Only, before I could determine what was going on, the light, the most intense thing I’ve ever witnessed.... I mean just a total white-out, asphalt, trees, everything evaporated in front of me, and then the damn thing goes out.  So I couldn’t get the gear into park fast enough, and then, using my left shoulder, pushed against the driver’s door, and managed to step from the car, and that’s when I looked up and this was after dark, skies were cloudy, the temperature below zero, -11 Fahrenheit, and there is this goddamn ball, circular ball, and it’s five or six hundred feet in diameter. I suppose this thing was about nine hundred feet, hung up above me, like a Christmas ornament, and dark as night, in silhouette, and a couple of rows of lights, dim yellow lights, around the middle. As far as I could tell, it didn’t make a sound. Now I’m thinking that no one is going to believe me, but someone up there sure as hell is looking over the place.;42.1171;-102.8919
